Then two months after release, you would expect that Colossal Order has fixed most of these bugs, yet almost all of them still exist. 

Generally speaking, it also seems like a lot of the features have not been properly tested. For instance, you cannot move or even delete an external building-upgrade, without deleting the entire complex of buildings with upgrades. Even if that single building burns down, you have to delete the ENTIRE complex of buildings/upgrades. Snapping is full of weird bugs, and the tools are tedius.

1151340,Fallout 76,"[h1]TL;DR at the end.[/h1]

I'm speaking [b]purely through my experience with the game.[/b] I am not a reviewer or anything, this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will. But opinions are opinions, if you enjoy Fallout 76, kudos to you, I love it when people are happy with their time spent on X or Y.
If only Steam had a neutral score. It's what the game deservers.


[i][u]Is Fallout 76 a good Fallout game?[/u][/i] No, far from it. Heck, I would say it's the worse Fallout experience out there. Even after almost 3 years, it's still kind of a mess. Gamebreaking bugs? Not that I have encountered, but lots and lots of other inconveniences, such as: frame drops, server issues, inventory management, clunky combat, missing items, getting out of bounds, player interactions, etc.

[i][u]Frame drops:[/u][/i] What happens when you decide to use a singleplayer-focus engine and force it to handle multiplayer? Fallout 76 happens. This game is terribly optimized, even if you have the recommended requirements expect fps drops in some open world areas, combine that with clunky combat and you have one hell of a combination. Indoors instances are fine for the most part (looking at you daily ops). So if you look at the minimun requirements and believe it will run at 50'ish fps (obviously depending on your specs) you're wrong, it's probably 20-30, be prepared to struggle. If I have to dig into the game files to fix performance issues we are doing something wrong.

[i][u]Server Issues:[/u][/i] Let's see: we have a good engine! Just a terrible choice for multiplayer I hope servers can at least be stable! And yes, for the most part they are. Sometimes enemies tp, sometimes you tp, sometimes it disconnects you just because, sometimes it can rewind your progress (granted it only happened once and it was just minutes of desync, didn't lose anything, just had to do a step on a quest again). It clearly struggles to keep up with everyone.

[i][u]Inventory Management:[/u][/i] I will never understand how there's people out there that defend Bethesda for selling us a better stash. The vanilla stash has a total weight limit of 1200 ibs. Sounds like a lot? It's not, it might look like it at the start and you might go ¨pppfff this wont get full anytime soon¨ ooohhh but it will and when it does. It's hell. Welp, time to scrap/sell weapons/armor if you want to keep the sweet sweet junk with you. Even your character's weight limit is awful, even if you have max Strength, max carry weight perks, lower weight of X item perks. You're still gonna get overencumbered, your inventory will sit at a nice 249/250, just as an example. So it's about collecting junk until the limit, scrap it on your CAMP and repeat, or you would repeat if it weren't because your stash will eventually be full as I mentioned. 
Sometimes it even bugs and you become overencumbered when you're clearly not hitting the weight limit. Good luck fast traveling!

[i][u]Clunky combat:[/u][/i] Combat in modern Fallout games has always been a mixed bagged, it's either good or meh at best. And here it's pure meh. Let me elaborate further; it plays like F4 or even F3 but it sure as hell doesn't feel as good. 60% of the guns in this game are just boring, you got your standard pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, gamma guns, laser guns, melee weapons, etc. They all feel plastic'ky, there's no weight, they sound boring. What I'm trying to get to is that they do not distinct from each other. It's just a bad gunplay overrall. What about the other 40%? It's actually really really good! When you start getting the late game guns it's a whole different experience----and that's also an issue. Difficulty in this game is everywhere, it's either hard just because or too easy oneshot everything'ish. And for some people, including me, that's just not engaging after the 12453th time. Weapons have durability, check, ammo management is there, check. While annoying as it is, it's Fallout after all.
[i]Sidenote: There's always a meta, there's always something that's on top of the food chain. And that's fine! But if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all *cough* bows *cough* why have them in the first place? Also give love to laser guns![/i]

[i][u]Missing items:[/u][/i] Honestly what's the point in grinding out gear just for it to have the slightest chance of dissapearing from your inventory forever? Well, I got that slightest chance. I lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of PA. 
Bethesda wont do anything about it and never will, believe in that, it's been an issue for a long time now. They'll just ignore your ticket and move on, because from their perspective you're a liar going out for free stuff.
Some lucky people just log off and in for it to be fixed, some do and doesn't do anything, can you guess which one I was?

[i][u]Out of bounds:[/u][/i] Okay, this is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out. As a fellow Vault Dweller Cannibal, it's so annoying eating your victims and *puuf* falling through the ground. It may not happen, but the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoying.

[i][u]Player Interactions:[/u][/i] It's been an issue since launch and will always be an issue because of the game's core concept of an Online Open World Fallout Game. Simply put: Everyone is playing their Fallout adventure at the same time and they sure as hell are the protagonist. ¨But I'm a solo player, I don't care!¨ Then why are you playing an online Fallout game? You might as well go to New Vegas and have one hell of a ride there.
Anyways, the world is just hugeeeeee and also empty. NPCs can't carry the emptiness, they'll just stand there and repeat the same two lines, and when you finally find somebody it usually goes like:
X: *heart*
Y: *heart* *leave*
PVP players are only a 10% of the playerbase and they seen to have a bad time looking to 1v1 somebody else other than Dave level 750 over there. So if you're looking to do that, be prepared to struggle too. Maybe adding a whole PVP dedicated server would fix it, but Bethesda doesn't care about PVP, they did try with Nuclear Winter the Battle Royale mode but we all know how that turned out. 
It's not all negatives though, CAMPs are amazing! It's crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their CAMP. The community is friendly 90% of the time, so don't be afraid to salute a fellow dweller!

[h1]But I still like you.[/h1]
Despite all that, I still like this game, but I cannot defend it at all, on the countrary I will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better. And that's about it, my main issues with F76, there's stuff I didn't talk about like seasons, or the terrible writting or quests in general. I also didn't mention the perk system, which makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a build.

[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]
Fallout 76, is it better now? Yes, 100%. Does that make it a good game? No, It's mediocre at best, if you have the reference of what a Fallout game has to have then you're probably gonna have lots of  issues with it. Newcomers to Fallout in general should be fine but believe me when I say there's a better product out there. This game is the worse first impression you're gonna get of the franchise.
Terrible inventory management, lackluster multiplayer experience, boring gun play, dumb difficulty scaling, performance issues and many others.
Want to buy it? Wait for sale, it's not worth the full price tag, not even those Deluxe editions. And please don't support Fallout First, it's a joke (all though it's your money, don't listen to this crazy girl).

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"SWTOR is a really good game IMO, it has a ton of customisation, story-lines and options for your play-style. I have played this game for god knows how long and when it came to steam as a free-to-play, I hopped back on!

[b] Pros : [/b]

It has an incredible amount of content for each story-line. Even if you're not planning to subscribe, you still get access to 8 class stories, who take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them . Then there's the usual MMORPG content, 4 man dungeons, 16 man raids and world bosses all with different difficulty levels (which IMO is kinda meh). It has good quality writing and storytelling throughout. The story in this game is amazing and stands far above most other MMOs I've played. Whoever you are, you'll find a story that suits your style. And despite its age, it has a REALLY immersive world with Amazing music and Great graphics!

[b] Cons : [/b]

The problem with the game is with the payment model. It's free to play, which means, you guessed it! EA are trying there hardest for all they're worth to make you buy the most ridiculous things. It is like they made a list of every single way they could get money out of you, for example a bunch of customisation which look hideous and outright stupid.
ANYWAYS... the new major updates really confuse me with who they are trying to appeal to? The only things you really get is ONE hour of new content, a bunch of bugs, EA removing features just so they could ruin our days...

[b] Is it still worth it too play? : [/b] 

Definitely yes. Even with the weird, confusing and annoying cons, I've been playing this for many years and I have been enjoying my time. But deciding on YOUR play-style, you might like or dislike this game. Everyone is different, for example, some people really hate long repetitive tasks (which is me) while some like them! This is maybe one of the best MMOs out there, but that does not mean it is perfect in every way.

If you like Star Wars and a decent storyline, you will love this game (or maybe not)! Even after finishing the 8 class stories, there are ways to play those stories differently on a second run which IMO makes this a great game.

[b] Tips & Tricks : [/b] 

1. If you subscribe once, you get all current content permanently and that is a LOT of content. After you do so, if it's only the access to content you're after, you no longer need to keep subscribing.
2. ADD THE SECURITY KEY APP TO YOUR PHONE AND CONNECT IT TO YOUR ACCOUNT! You get 100 free cartel coins (cash shop currency) every single month. That is a big deal. It adds up quickly. You will not regret it.
3. When you first make a new character, press Y. Make a legacy, give yourself a last name for all your characters. Do it ASAP, because you'll want to level it up! It is really really important.
4. These are codes for special mounts that you should get as early as possible!

This is an obvious mistake as I do not cheat in any games. I ""appealed"" because this is clearly a mistake and I would just like to log in and play so I can resume the grind.
I received a response almost immediately with what is clearly an auto response and the news that my account would remain perma'd,
""We reserve the right to determine what constitutes unfair play and to take corrective action we deem appropriate.

As a result, your Lost Ark account remains permanently banned.

We can’t share any further information about our decision, and we won’t reply to further emails about this issue.""

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"I come from competitive TF2, from War Thunder, from OW, from freaking Rainbow Six Siege where the mire of toxicity and cheaters and bots and paid battle passes and the thousand and two ways game companies try to milk you for cash are just a part of EVERYDAY EXISTENCE. First person shooters where everyone talks trash, f***s over their teammates, baits them, leaves them to die, head shots them for speaking, or just ignores that they even exist. Where the formats of the games support, encourage, and even reward the ""I'm better than all you losers"" attitude in every direction.

I hadn't realized how much energy was getting sucked from me at every turn until I started this game.

Ghost Ship said that they start at the very basis of the game by making it cooperative. And with the way the mechanics of this game works, the vast majority of this community is supportive, helpful, and will go out of their way to make things work well for you. The simple mechanic of everyone shares in everything that's gained during the game is genius. Cheaters can't take anything from anyone else. The whole host system make it impossible for bots to ruin people's day. If someone's trying to ruin a game you're hosting, you can kick them. It's amazing.

And the weapons and dwarves have vast variety in abilities, adaptability to your game play and style, and everyone can tackle it as hard or as casually as they desire.  And I think this game actually does a good job of meeting TF2 levels of Funny.  I have friends who do Haz 5 as the Only Way To Go and others who prefer to just play at Haz 3 and talk, enjoy themselves, and make more gradual progress while enjoying the heck out of the loadouts they have. None of those ways are ""wrong"".  The possible ways to progress in abilities are the Perk System, Weapons, Weapon Upgrades, Overclocks, and just playing the game to figure out how it all works.

And the game itself gives me these amazing interludes to just be with the people I choose to play with. We can explore these vast, beautiful, new caverns with each other and marvel at what we find, have beers together and kick a few barrels at the base, or do stupid Funny things with mobility boosts for the sheer joy of it and have our friends bring us back when we fall.

The battle pass system is FREE. There is NO paid track. You can't just Go Fast By Flinging Money at the company. It's also mostly cosmetic, but also gives you rewards of minerals that help you progress on equipment. And after the season, those cosmetics are available in other ways. There's no missing out on a Hat that has come and gone.

You can pay Ghost Ship more money by buying their DLC cosmetic packs. I flung as much as I could and then bought more games for more people and got a full XBox setup to play with a friend there as well. Anything that will persuade Ghost Ship to DO MOAR is a priority in my book. 

The game play is generational, varied, and the numerous and entirely gorgeous biomes all have their own characteristics and barriers. The missions are all different and when mixed and matched with the biomes create a vast array of adventures that never really feel like they repeat.  I can pick how many enemies I want to come up against and how hard they are to defeat and we get rewarded in proportion to that. There's a lot to learn. I love the music, too, and how it heralds swarms and intense combat situations.

All that AND hats. Coming from TF2, I value Hats and cosmetics and being able to personalize MY characters. *laughs* It's a good thing, and there are so many ways to customize the way your funny little men look as well as how they play and what they can do.

So, yeah, I encourage you to get it, and if you're one of my friends, ping me and we'll play.",come competitive tf2 war thunder ow freaking rainbow six siege mire toxicity cheater bot paid battle pass thousand two way game company try milk cash part everyday existence first person shooter everyone talk trash f teammate bait leaf die head shot speaking ignores even exist format game support encourage even reward better loser attitude every direction realized much energy getting sucked every turn started game ghost ship said start basis game making cooperative way mechanic game work vast majority community supportive helpful go way make thing work well simple mechanic everyone share everything gained game genius cheater take anything anyone else whole host system make impossible bot ruin people day someone trying ruin game hosting kick amazing weapon dwarf vast variety ability adaptability game play style everyone tackle hard casually desire think game actually good job meeting tf2 level funny friend haz 5 way go others prefer play haz 3 talk enjoy make gradual progress enjoying heck loadouts none way wrong possible way progress ability perk system weapon weapon upgrade overclocks playing game figure work game give amazing interlude people choose play explore vast beautiful new cavern marvel find beer together kick barrel base stupid funny thing mobility boost sheer joy friend bring u back fall battle pas system free paid track go fast flinging money company also mostly cosmetic also give reward mineral help progress equipment season cosmetic available way missing hat come gone pay ghost ship money buying dlc cosmetic pack flung much could bought game people got full xbox setup play friend well anything persuade ghost ship moar priority book game play generational varied numerous entirely gorgeous biome characteristic barrier mission different mixed matched biome create vast array adventure never really feel like repeat pick many enemy want come hard defeat get rewarded proportion lot learn love music herald swarm intense combat situation hat coming tf2 value hat cosmetic able personalize character laugh good thing many way customize way funny little men look well play yeah encourage get one friend ping play

1063730,New World,"Would I recommend it?  lol no.

The first week or so of the game was kind of interesting since their take on combat was pretty distinct for an MMO.  But so much about this game was a complete disaster, and once everyone moved beyond the low levels and newbie status the warts became incredibly apparent.

First off, and I don't know how they thought this was a good idea, the only way to legitimately turn a profit was from completing non-repeatable story quests - something which I'd realized within my first few hours in the game, so how this went over the heads of the devs is beyond me.  Any other content and you'd be spending more on repairs than you could possibly earn while grinding.  The only way suggested way to make money was to sell things on the auction house to other players.  But where are they making money if not on the auction house?  And keep in mind, on top of repairs, and buying stuff from your faction (which cost gold AS WELL AS faction currency), and off the AH, there was also recurring costs from housing which were one of many gold sinks. 
 So deflation would have quickly become a major major issue, except for the fact that the game had several gold dupe exploits that people used to exponentially grow their wealth.  Yeah, some of the dupers got caught in the bans, but the smart ones laundered effectively.  So either you are an honest player, and become completely broke as you reach high levels and run out of quests to complete for money, or you're an insanely wealthy duper.  Or an Auction House Savant who profits off wealthy dupers I guess.

And then the end-game felt pretty unfinished.  And the fact that you'd have to grind to get keys to run a dungeon even once is annoying.  Basically, the game was doomed to fail from the outset and I couldn't in good faith recommend it to anyone.

That said, I don't regret my time in it since for that first week the PvP was actually kind of fun due to the interesting combat mechanics, and beyond that it was fascinating to see just how colossally one could screw up an MMO.  There is not a snowball's chance in heck I'll ever reinstall though.",would recommend lol first week game kind interesting since take combat pretty distinct mmo much game complete disaster everyone moved beyond low level newbie status wart became incredibly apparent first know thought good idea way legitimately turn profit completing non repeatable story quest something realized within first hour game went head devs beyond content spending repair could possibly earn grinding way suggested way make money sell thing auction house player making money auction house keep mind top repair buying stuff faction cost gold well faction currency ah also recurring cost housing one many gold sink deflation would quickly become major major issue except fact game several gold dupe exploit people used exponentially grow wealth yeah dupers got caught ban smart one laundered effectively either honest player become completely broke reach high level run quest complete money insanely wealthy duper auction house savant profit wealthy dupers guess end game felt pretty unfinished fact grind get key run dungeon even annoying basically game doomed fail outset good faith recommend anyone said regret time since first week pvp actually kind fun due interesting combat mechanic beyond fascinating see colossally one could screw mmo snowball chance heck ever reinstall though

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"A very fun but not perfect game:

What I liked:

- You don't need to know every Harry Potter book/movie before playing Hogwarts Legacy to get immersed into this world
- Hogwarts and its surrounding areas are built in high detail and provide an awesome atmosphere
- Exploration is fun, as the world is believable and well designed
- The combat system seemed unusual at first but I ended up loving it. Might actually be one of my favourite mechanics of all video games I played: It is fast paced, dynamic and (at first) challenging, but once you get the hang of it, the fluid combat is just satisfying
- Some of the quests were really fun

What I didn't enjoy:

- After an interesting start, the first third or first half of the game felt repetitive and somewhat tedious: To learn Spell X you talk to professor Y but he or she won't teach it to you unless you do some basic fetch quest type of tasks first. Learn the spell and repeat the process over and over again
- This way of storytelling repeated all over the main quest line. The main quest itself would have been several hours shorter, if the people you need information from would just give it to you. Instead, you often end up having to do them some favors first or do preperation work. This does in fact make sense and wouldn't be an issue, but after a few hours you start to notice this repeating pattern. (The second half of the game is more interesting in my opinion)
- The game would have benefited from more depth in terms of RPG mechanics. Meaningful choices, more interactions in the open world. The majority of NPCs in the game are just for decoration (e.g. generic students all over the castle) but only a small amount actually has a purpose for the quests.

1151340,Fallout 76,"What if I told you that the endgame in Fallout 76 requires you to build a team of 4 and scatter about the map looking for 24 time sensitive encrypted key fragments. After finding them, you sit down together and decrypt a complicated and specific code that allows you to launch a nuclear missile onto the playable map. Feeling accomplished, your team gets together to assault one of the nuclear missile silos in an attempt to do your first launch. You spend a majority of your resources finding ways through this highly classified military facility and fighting off hordes of powerful robots. When you finally launch the nuke, it temporarily alters the playable map to a much crazier state. When you travel there, a giant boss appears. Already drained of most of your resources from clearing the silo, you fight with all you've got and scrape by to barely defeat the mighty enemy in time. You and your buddies claim awesome loot and talk about how you can't wait to do it again in a week or so after you've built up more materials.


Doesn't that sound incredible? Amazing experience. 

Now this is what it's really like. You google the launch code because once someone completes it, it's the same code for everyone. Solo, you clip through the front door of the missile silo, which causes the game to not trigger any enemies, and immediately launch without fighting anything significant. The nuke lands and does nothing to the terrain except change the color of some plants. The boss spawns and you fire on it, but some random player with a hacked weapon kills it nearly instantly before you do enough damage, so you get no rewards. 10 minutes later you launch another nuke only to lag out in ground zero because enemies are endlessly spawning under the ground. You eventually kill the boss and get basic items that you could loot practically anywhere else in the world. 


This experience pretty much sums up the entire game. Fallout 76 was masterfully crafted... on the whiteboard. In execution it is frequently a catastrophe. If half the things in this game actually worked the way they intended, I feel like this would literally be one of the best games of all time. But because almost every experience is bastardized, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I have sunken numerous hours into this game because I play video games 24/7.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"Greetings from USA! I am Walter (or Fat gringo) and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs. I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review below, while still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age"".

Star Wars: The Old Republic is now ten years old at the time of this publication. The game has an incredible amount of content to offer to a new player. The learning curve is not too steep and the stories are all free to enjoy them at your own pace.

All the way up to level 60 is currently available 100% free of charge. You can play all 8 origin class stories to level 50, and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60.

If you enjoy playing casually, you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account. However, once you approach the EndGame, you start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard. Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriber, you may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expires.

SWTOR offers tons of solo content, but it shines in the group play, especially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available. Be it casual or hardcore, raiding, PvPing, exploration, Conquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game. Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into them, then join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grind.

Being a ten years old game, SWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game. I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single update, change, bright moments and failures over the years. It's a thing to consider, but if you are reading this review, you are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game. Yes, absolutely.

The game engine is a giant issue from the very beginning. Low FPS in group environment such as Operations and Warzones may be frequent and the graphics of the game in the old content really shows how long it's been since SWTOR's release. BioWare is dedicated to updating the old content slowly from time to time.

Enjoy your own Star Wars Saga with fully voiced over cinematic story experience and personal choices that some times lead to real consequences down the line.",greeting usa walter fat gringo playing swtor since one beta stage without break time out would like encourage give game try quick review still honest flaw game elderly age star war old republic ten year old time publication game incredible amount content offer new player learning curve steep story free enjoy pace way level 60 currently available 100 free charge play 8 origin class story level 50 continue first digital expansion game level 60 enjoy playing casually could subscribe month get story content unlocked forever account however approach endgame start feeling limitation f2p model hard find like play subscriber may struggle get back preferred status player middle limitation level sub expires swtor offer ton solo content shine group play especially team guildies voice chat available casual hardcore raiding pvping exploration conquest everything fun friend game play class story alone immerse fully join guild play friend find endgame grind ten year old game swtor struggle offer continuously fresh engaging content hard core fan veteran game playing since beta witnessed every single update change bright moment failure year thing consider reading review probably wondering worth picking game yes absolutely game engine giant issue beginning low fps group environment operation warzones may frequent graphic game old content really show long since swtor release bioware dedicated updating old content slowly time time enjoy star war saga fully voiced cinematic story experience personal choice time lead real consequence line

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"Sadly this review is negative. 

The performance is just unacceptable, there are some rendering issues plaguing the game, and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game.

From small guard shacks with modeled out wires, computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count, they are a waste of computer resources.

The whole unecessary addition of a ''citizen lifepath'' is something very few players asked for, and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game. 

The truth is, these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all, id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail, or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist, and not a procgen program, before i would consider paying attention to the ''lifepath'' stuff this game offers.

I wanted to love this game, and in a way i still do, everything else Cities Skylines 1 did is improved in 2, but the terrible performance, and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me. 

Also, this game has a launcher, and just like the 1st game, its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever, beyond serving advertisements to you for Nvidia.

This review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future, and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added..... Before then, if you are not brand loyalist like me, stick to the first game a while longer, this game needs a couple more months in the oven.

Edit: Further thoughts:

After longer play A noticeable issue is that Residential zoning demand is based on *density* not on *affordability*

Wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does.

This results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning, even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient, limiting your planning abilities and creativity.

The game will complain about there being a ''housing crisis'' when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings. 

City policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally, instead having to be set per district. 

Building upgrades are a great mechanic however. 

Virtual texturing/texture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects (primarily hedges) causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them. This happens even with less performance intensive cities.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Fair warning: i give this game a thumbs up, but my description will be largely negative.

The issue is the current balancing level.

For starters at the beginning you quickly realize that farming wont be an option for a while .... you create a field, ""plough"" it and then ... realize that you HAVE to fertilize it before you can plant anything. Now you can only get fertilizer by walking across the map to the 1 or 2 NPC who sell it ... just to realize you have no money. Other option would be a pigsty ...but that opens another 2 issues. Issue 1 is you obviously need pigs which cost a fortune. Issue No.2 is that you need to unlock the building first. It requires 500 farming skill points. Now considering that most actions grant a meager 1-2 skill points, you basically have to turn the whole map into farmland just to unlock it.

Other balancing issues. The biggest field you can make it 16x16 tiles. Ploughing that field reuires 6 or 7 wooden hoes (they break insanely fast) ... the only hoe you have at the start. Considering that each hoe needs a log and a tree nets 3-4 logs we are talking about 2-3 Trees just for that. Other (early game) tools last about as long as that.
Most likely food in the beginning is gathering mushrooms .... 0.1kg mushroom adds 1 to the food gauge which caps at 100. So you're guy needs to eat 10kg mushrooms to be no longer hungry ... and he needs to do that twice a day. Similar for other food. 0.2kg of roasted meat adds 6 food, meaning you need to eat 3.2kg of roasted meat... actually the return on mushrooms is so poor, you might actually starve to death WHILE running through woods literally eating the shrooms from the ground.

Village management.
You have to build everything yourself, no way to get the ppl in your village involved. A new guy is joining the village ? He will become unhappy and leave if you dont build him a house. Cutting down trees for wood or hunting for food sounds like a good idea ? Other then the player your villager bots are incapable of hunting without having a hunters lodge build (which you have to unlock first..) nor can they cut down tree's without a woodcutter's lodge (which you need to unlock as well) even if only to sustain themselves. You spent ages just carrying materials from A to B, mostly because you can only carry 35kg (which includes tools, food and your cloths) and the game has no carriages either

Villager management.
Noone will ever come and settle in your village. You actually have to walk across the whole map and ""convince"" an unemployed hobo, that having a house and work in your village is better then sitting at the campfire all day. To do that you need (global) dynasty reputation and personal reputation with that guy... why i don't know.
Why do you have to be of a famous bloodline and a good friend to convince an unemployed hobo to join a village where he can have a house and work...
Not like it matters. Once (s)he joine (s)he will immediately complain. He is still homeless (which he strangely did not care about before he joined your village) ... so yes, you actually have to personally build him a house. Then he will complain that there is no food  ... or firewood . Generally you have to build a ressource and fodd storage.
This opens another issue ... you always have a build limit. At first it's 1 .. you build your own house. Then it is 4... look above you need  your house (#1), villager house (#2), food storage (#3) and ressource storage (#4) ... can't build anything where your villager can work....and you have to manually supply food and firewood ...until you unlocked a bigger build limit.

Storage.
Now this is the biggest issue. Your character can carry 35kg. Axe, Hammer, Cloth , food (remember your character eats like 6-7kg roasted meat per day), potentially water, a weapon.... 35kg is nothing. Now since you have to build everything manually you spent ages carrying building materials. You cannot build from the village storage either...so you carry logs from storage to new building, walking the distance multiple times per house. It gets worse if you have to chop the wood yourself. Naturally tree's dont instantly regrow ...so with every tree you chop, the walking distance increases.
This doesn't get better with the village. Building chests or storages is not possible. Instead you have a single chest in the house ... which can hold another measly 50kg. The ""storage"" buildings aren't much better. The basic ressource storage is a rather big ""barn"" ... but the inside is completely empty except for a single measly chest... which at least can hold 200kg.

And i'm not done. You are incapable of building anything within a very generous distance of exiting npc villages ... and even the meager hut of the hunter counts as village. Also you cannot use anything you have not build yourself. The ""starting"" village has a woodcutters which is needed to make planks ... but you cannot use it. So you can't make any tools or materials unless you actually unlocked and build the building yourself ... which is insane considering the points required for most of them. It gets worse though .... the game has no ""pass time"" function. So you reach a village late evening ... nobody wants to talk to you anymore. The only way to skip time is to sleep in a bed or at a campfire ... bot of which exist in town but you cannot use either, or to build your own ... which you can't anywhere near a village, So you either have to walk out into the wild so you can make a fire...or wait w/e amount of real world time is needed for the game to reach day again.

Other issues include weapons and crafting. You need 1 log to make a single hoe or wooden spear .. now i reckon a spear that requires a full log as material cannot be lifted by mortal men.... same with damage. A meager fox requires 2-3 wooden spears (around the size of a man) to the face before he dies. Seeing a tiny fox with 2 giant spears through his head comming for you is kinda.... gets worse when you fight Wisent or bears .... those still come with you when they have 6+ spears stuck in their head. That gets mildly questionable when you kill the bear with 3 or 4 meager stone arrows....

I'm sure i missed stuff that needs fixing and minor details ... so thats not even the full list.
So why the recommend ? Well, it's still in developement.
The game is largely stable. I have encountered no crashes and only 1 bug so far (my wife was reduced to a non-targetable robe sliding across the ground). Stuff mostly works with only minor issues. Day/Night cycles are working fine, it looks the job.
In short the basics are all good, the issue mostly lies with the details and those can easily be changed. A decent survival game in a ""kingdom come"" world.

Addendum:
Spawning peasents
Currently the game is set to spawn a fixed amount of free peasents at the camp fires of the villages and the peasents actually migrate between those . It would be easy to allow the player to build a ""spawn campfire"" as well and spawn/migrate peasents there..

Hiring new villagers
it would be easy to change that villagers without a job have no upkeep. This reflects the fact that without a job he has 24hours a day to care for himself. This would balance itself since a villager without job does not produce anything ... and once you assign a job he requires upkeep.

Building 
They could just define a certain area around your buildings as village and allow you to directly build/craft from storage while on village ground ... or add a range check. They can just add worker slots to unfinished buildings for builders, using the crafting skill and material from storage ... just like any other craft.

So even if it's not on their roadmap, most of the issues could be ""fixed"" during lunch break...

John Madden represented a love of sports, teaching sports, entertainment and a love of the game in general. Madden 24 doesn't offer any of that.
The NFL should consider giving the license to someone who loves the sport, rather than someone whose only interest is to get the kids money out of their pockets as quickly as possible.

The technical performance is absolute horror. The changes in Francise Mode are ridiculously small. The gameplay is completely broken and bugs from the last few years are still there. My TE prefers to run down field to block the FS instead of the much closer and more dangerous LB.

One gets the impression that EA and Tiburon are no longer interested in developing the game, but simply want to get as much money out of it as possible with minimal effort.

1062090,Timberborn,"Timberborn stands out from other survival settlement builders through its use of water management (and its villagers being beavers, of course). By which I mean it is necessary as part of the core mechanics to build and maintain dams in order to control the flow of water, at first in order to survive the seasonal droughts, but then also to begin to divert river flow to bring life to dry areas of the game map.

Is this a decent game in the state it is at the time of the review? Yes. But it's Early Access status is certainly showing. Not with its actual mechanics and stability, as it handles pretty nicely and whilst not fully without issue, is very well polished. But past the early game, there's not a whole lot to do. 

Progression revolves around research. Research revolves around... well sticking a guy in a building that doesn't even require any additional resources. Of course, it speed up research, you'll want a larger colony; and to maintain a larger colony, you're going to want to research more advanced concepts, which are going to require new resources as you bridge the tiers. And to be fair, there are a decent number of upgrades available through research. Enough that the core game is certainly there and in a complete state, but... ideally there could be more. Certainly, there is more to it than Banished, which is the typical yardstick people measure this kind of game against these days.

The issue with this is though that there isn't much incentive to do stuff after you've cemented your survival. Great, you've built a huge lake that'll retain water throughout even the longest of droughts without risking the death of your crops. Now what? There isn't much incentive to expand, except maybe to scavenge for scrap metal. You can easily reach the end of the research tree on maybe 3 districts alone. And when you do, you'll be left thinking ""now what?"".

So what you have here is a game with a great lumberpunk aesthetic, great core ideas and a robust game engine... but not a whole lot to do after a fact. Yes, there are multiple factions, but right now there are only 2 of those, and whilst they do play differently enough it does increase increase replayability, they're not different enough to make that second playthrough interesting once you've gotten used to those differences. It is my hope that Timberborn will fix these aspects before it leaves Early Access, because it really does have the potential to stand up there with games like the Anno series. It just needs some fleshing out to get there.",timberborn stand survival settlement builder use water management villager beaver course mean necessary part core mechanic build maintain dam order control flow water first order survive seasonal drought also begin divert river flow bring life dry area game map decent game state time review yes early access status certainly showing actual mechanic stability handle pretty nicely whilst fully without issue well polished past early game whole lot progression revolves around research research revolves around well sticking guy building even require additional resource course speed research want larger colony maintain larger colony going want research advanced concept going require new resource bridge tier fair decent number upgrade available research enough core game certainly complete state ideally could certainly banished typical yardstick people measure kind game day issue though much incentive stuff cemented survival great built huge lake retain water throughout even longest drought without risking death crop much incentive expand except maybe scavenge scrap metal easily reach end research tree maybe 3 district alone left thinking game great lumberpunk aesthetic great core idea robust game engine whole lot fact yes multiple faction right 2 whilst play differently enough increase increase replayability different enough make second playthrough interesting gotten used difference hope timberborn fix aspect leaf early access really potential stand game like anno series need fleshing get

You have more freedom and space in placing the buildings than in Frostpunk. You have more resources to attend to and you have more buildings. 

The atmosphere is good and the soundtrack is as well!

This is a solid start for an early-access game. I would rate it 10/10 for early access! I also didn't encounter any bugs and the game is challenging and fun if you are a survival city builder type of player.

252490,Rust,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. 

All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",around hour half bad spawn scarce resource short lived venture inhabited area map ran first friendly player met rust initially spotted pretty far away paid real notice rock equipped eventually got close enough u clearly see upon realization neither u hostile pulled torch mutual sign peace highest possible level non aggression exist rust dropped old hatchet finished crafting one metal gave food sign good faith nearly 30 minute searching scavenging pooled enough resource craft u minimally decent gear knew wanted progress would need mine boulder lot used remaining material put together 9mm handgun several bullet though reminded case really needed decided earlier many unwanted experience bullet face would try hardest run around slaughtering every newly spawned player came across minute camp encountered player hunting bow running hatchet quickly took handgun inventory pointed direction attempting scare away player far enough away continued road towards stone area surrounded tree opted stand guard handgun friend mined moving next boulder heard gunfire start turned around see player assault rifle gunning friend could land shot already begun shooting moment remembered even crafted sleeping bag camp one objective trip taking typed chat thanking friend made help asking player killed u intruding area something along line simply wrote sorry guy single problem game like shoot sight player obviously taken u surprise better equipped u even justifiable reason approaching two poorly equipped player really considering middle wood pretty much gear could need game could easily told u cooperate either putting away weapon leaving area course come around see player trying gather enough supply get stable point game decides go way approach u use unecessary ammo hatchet handgun four bullet add even insult add apology end choice shoot two unexpecting half naked unprepared player though see lot potential game good community shine every wish people would realize need go around killing player chance experience game people like single reason many player steam feel wasted money would otherwise great experience
2198510,New Cycle,"Just play Endzone - much better game with similar settings.

The main problem of this game is that the resources are just magically transported everywhere, the people that you see walking around are just for the atmosphere. So, the planing, the positioning of the buildings, which is usually so important in this type of games, matters less in this one. You can just plop gathering post on the opposite site of the map, and it will be built and operated in exactly the same way as if it is next to the town center, despite of the fact that the builder had time only to go 1/10th of the way to the construction site.

The pace of the game is also terribly slow. There are no interesting decisions to make - the development is very linear, and is defined by your research tree, which is also quite linear. The only good part about this game is good graphics.

I understand that this is beta, but the game mechanics has to be changed significantly, and I suspect this will not happen. They will just add new stuff and fine tune the existing one. It will not make game interesting in my opinion.",play endzone much better game similar setting main problem game resource magically transported everywhere people see walking around atmosphere planing positioning building usually important type game matter le one plop gathering post opposite site map built operated exactly way next town center despite fact builder time go 1 10th way construction site pace game also terribly slow interesting decision make development linear defined research tree also quite linear good part game good graphic understand beta game mechanic changed significantly suspect happen add new stuff fine tune existing one make game interesting opinion

552990,World of Warships,"This is a review I did not want to make. For background, I've been silently playing WOWS for around ~2.5 years. While not a pro, I consider myself to be an well above average player that has a fairly deep understanding of the game and where it's at in 2021. I've sunk thousands of hours into this game both for fun and in the competitive scene. While I have no doubt new players may be able to pick up the game and have fun for a while, there are several core systematic issues that make it so I cannot in good faith recommend this game to someone who's looking to play long-term. Here's my thoughts on what the game does good, bad, and the biggest reason why I simply can't recommend it in 2021. 

The Good:
[list]
[*]Art Style is excellent - from the ship models, to the landscape, to the effects it looks great and performs well on many different levels of hardware
[*]Continuous Content - Wargaming has never had an issue expanding content and this game is no different. Ship lines (some historical, most not) are getting released at a very quick pace which is great to combat game fatigue
[*]General mechanics - While not perfect (detonation, overmatch, CV 3D spotting) the game is easy to play at a low level but the mechanics are complex enough that even beta players are still learning every nuance and will be for years to come. 
[*]Rate of progression - I might be in a small camp here, but I actually enjoy the rate of progression. Compared to something like WarThunder (MUCH slower rate of progression), I think they struck a much better balance of grind vs. accomplishment. 
[/list]

The Bad:
[list]
[*]Botched CV Rework - Two years ago a complete reworking of the aircraft carrier class dropped. This rework (testers had told them time and time again it wasn't ready) broke the game for a good ~6 months. While they are more ""balanced"" now, what we are left with is a horrendous excuse for a class that (statistically) has the highest damage, nearly the highest average kills, highest spotting, the by FAR lowest death rate, and the highest impact in the game by far. They are not fun to play, and really not fun to play against. Total and complete failure. 
[*]Poor ship balance (especially on legacy ships) - While they continue to add lines, they continue to ignore player, tester, and community contributor feedback on ship balance. They know it's an issue internally, and the proof is in the pudding. For the last two clan battles they've had 6+ ships so powerful they had to be banned/number restricted. Players have been shouting about these ships for months with no adjustments. There's also legacy ships that have been broken for years and their solution is to simply remove them from sale instead of implementing smart progressive adjustments to existing ships. 
[*]Commander Rework (Also the game direction it signals) - Commanders are of supreme importance in WOWS. With the recent commander rework, they released it in a broken state (surprise) and that led to a complete reinforcement of the ""sniper BB"" meta (dead-eye). Beyond that, they made many nonsensical changes that increase the point cost of vital skills. Commander total points was raised from 19 to 21, which in it's own isn't an issue. The XP required to go from 19-21 is damn near as much as it takes to get from 3-19. This means that the vast majority of the community will not only never have a 21 point commander (further increasing the veteran/new player gap) but it makes it so that few players are acquiring ""elite commander XP"" which can be used to retrain commanders on another ship. They now charge around 500 doubloons (payed currency) for the retraining.
[/list]

The largest and the reason I am writing this review now is the recent change to ""signal flags"". These are special flags that can be applied to a ship before the battle that give straight buffs - not different game-play - just straight buffs. For instance,  ""Juliet Charlie"" provides [b]100%[/b] resistance to detonation (a completely random mechanic that 1 shots your ship), or ""India Delta"" that grants +20% to the amount of HP healed while using repair party. While I think they shouldn't exist in general, I have to note these flag were able to be easily acquired via completely free means of completing missions and reaching achievements in-game like ""First Blood"" (getting the first kill of a game). The last patch, they completely removed the latter possibility. They did so with little to no communication that they would do so (because obvious fear of backlash). The only realistic means to acquire these flags is now to spend currency (doubloons, straight buying them, coal - which you can effectively buy with IRL money). Make no mistake, these flags are not optional. They provide such a utterly massive advantage over others that you are required to run at the very least the core flags to succeed at a high level. The company has made it clear with this decision that they are okay with obvious forms of pay-to-win and will risk the backlash for more profit. The divide between new and veteran players is already so large, and this is truly the nail in the coffin. For this reason, and the others listed I will be parting ways with this game and I hope anyone considering playing this game competitively/long-term will reconsider. In the year 2021 they do not care about preserving game-play, they just want money. Pay up, or watch your ship go up in flames.",review want make background silently playing wow around 2 5 year pro consider well average player fairly deep understanding game 2021 sunk thousand hour game fun competitive scene doubt new player may able pick game fun several core systematic issue make good faith recommend game someone looking play long term thought game good bad biggest reason simply recommend 2021 good list art style excellent ship model landscape effect look great performs well many different level hardware continuous content wargaming never issue expanding content game different ship line historical getting released quick pace great combat game fatigue general mechanic perfect detonation overmatch cv 3d spotting game easy play low level mechanic complex enough even beta player still learning every nuance year come rate progression might small camp actually enjoy rate progression compared something like warthunder much slower rate progression think struck much better balance grind v accomplishment list bad list botched cv rework two year ago complete reworking aircraft carrier class dropped rework tester told time time ready broke game good 6 month balanced left horrendous excuse class statistically highest damage nearly highest average kill highest spotting far lowest death rate highest impact game far fun play really fun play total complete failure poor ship balance especially legacy ship continue add line continue ignore player tester community contributor feedback ship balance know issue internally proof pudding last two clan battle 6 ship powerful banned number restricted player shouting ship month adjustment also legacy ship broken year solution simply remove sale instead implementing smart progressive adjustment existing ship commander rework also game direction signal commander supreme importance wow recent commander rework released broken state surprise led complete reinforcement sniper bb meta dead eye beyond made many nonsensical change increase point cost vital skill commander total point raised 19 21 issue xp required go 19 21 damn near much take get 3 19 mean vast majority community never 21 point commander increasing veteran new player gap make player acquiring elite commander xp used retrain commander another ship charge around 500 doubloon payed currency retraining list largest reason writing review recent change signal flag special flag applied ship battle give straight buff different game play straight buff instance juliet charlie provides b 100 b resistance detonation completely random mechanic 1 shot ship india delta grant 20 amount hp healed using repair party think exist general note flag able easily acquired via completely free mean completing mission reaching achievement game like first blood getting first kill game last patch completely removed latter possibility little communication would obvious fear backlash realistic mean acquire flag spend currency doubloon straight buying coal effectively buy irl money make mistake flag optional provide utterly massive advantage others required run least core flag succeed high level company made clear decision okay obvious form pay win risk backlash profit divide new veteran player already large truly nail coffin reason others listed parting way game hope anyone considering playing game competitively long term reconsider year 2021 care preserving game play want money pay watch ship go flame

------------------------------

[b]Note[/b] I initially wrote this review in May of 2021, but couldn't post it because I played the game through family share...

[b]TLDR:[/b] Get it on a huge discount if you really want to.

I don't write reviews very often, but I am a big fan of the Borderlands series and boy do I have a lot to say about this one...

I'll try to keep it short. This is a hard review to write, its a lot of mixed feelings and a lot of good and bad. I've never seen a game do some things SO god damn good and also SO painfully bad. So I was thinking about this for a while and really wanna give it a negative review, but I guess its worth your time if you get it cheap. 

If you are playing this there is a high chance you are coming here from the previous games in the series, and I will be comparing a few things to them (mostly to BL2 as I played that more recently than The Pre-Sequel and don't remember much from that one).And with that said I'll give you my thoughts:

------------------------------
	[h1]The good:[/h1]
------------------------------

The biggest plus for this game is its gameplay. [b]The guns and abilities[/b] are incredibly well done and feel great and fun to use. Guns have gotten a huge upgrade in every way; they look and feel miles better, a lot of them have alternate modes that range from switching scopes or firing modes, to switching elemental type, to having a god damn rpg under your barrel!
[b]The world[/b] has gotten much bigger and there is many reasons to go exploring. I personally found the worldly collectibles and hunts very enjoyable and was always excited to do them when I reached a new area.
But bigger worlds means lots more traveling, thankfully this time you can do it in style! [b]The vehicles[/b] have gotten much love as well. With the addition of one more vehicle type and A LOT of customization you will have a great time personalizing your favorite one. And its more than just style, the mods are practical too! But I will let you find out what they are. :)
Speaking of [b]customization,[/b] it is not only for your vehicles. You still got heads and skins for your own character as before but that has gotten a bit of a polish as well, and additionally you can change the colors of your skins yourself. Besides that you also have skins for your Echo, weapon skins and trinkets (Yes even for legendaries - And let me save you some time, the button to change the skin is X! Took me goddamn forever to figure out, more on this later.) and you also have some neat little things for your room on the ship.
[b]Your ship,[/b] yes, that is also a good thing. I love it, I love when games give us this cool space to hang out and call home while we adventure around. Especially when it has some little things here and there that allow us to personalize it more.
And since you have a ship you will of course use it, to travel around space and [b]different planets.[/b] The whole concept of space travel and hunting for different vaults was really cool and honestly kinda wished there was more of it. 
[b]The soundtrack[/b] is also pretty dope! Boss fights and ambient/exploration music is top tier!

	[h1]The bad, the ugly, the painfully horrible...[/h1]
------------------------------

*sigh* Here we go. As much as I loved everything I've written so far, what comes from here has just tilted the scale more towards a negative review with every hour more I spent in the game.
[b]The story and writting[/b] is absolute and utter trash. This has to be a different writting team than it was in BL2, right? Please tell me it is? It feels like Randy himself wrote this in a fever dream and trying to be part of the ""cool kids"". Besides several plot holes the story is just so painful and almost insulting to the player base.
[b]The main villains[/b] are extremely cringy and annoying. Like, I cant even stress enough how cringy they are. Two dumbass twich streamers who will go every extra mile to piss you off with their annoying and obnoxious dialogue and behavior. I get that they are supposed to annoying and bad, but not ""I really need to mute this game to be able to play it"" kinda bad. And yes I get they would never top Handsome Jack, but this is just an insult to his legacy. They are not memorable characters that make me draw a picture in my mind when someone names the game. If anything they just make me wanna go back to BL2 and enjoy good writing.
The writing and jokes are so out of touch, out of place and I'm out of my head when they're around. (heh-heh) I really don't know who this was aimed at, what kind of audience, but guessing with all the Epic bullsh*t surrounding this game its probably some Fortnite kiddos.
They did introduce a bunch of new characters though but literally only 3 of them make me not want to cut my ears off and stab my eyeballs, and hell some of those 3 even got me to chuckle a few times. ( Never knew Ice-T is such a good voice actor!)
Another thing, the [b]cutscenes.[/b] WHERE.THE.F**K.AM.I.IN.THE.GODDAMN.CUTSCENES?! The player literally doesn't exist in the story. You are just a glorified button pusher. This is something that pissed me off greatly, some major plot points happening with certain characters and where am I? Just standing there behind the scenes, jerking off and watching it happening? God forbid I try to jump in and be a part of the god damn game! Ugh...
Speaking of jumping, you can bet your ass Randy is jumping from joy with all the money pouring in from this game. He sure took notes when the Sims hit the steam store, so [b]be prepared to drop a fortune[/b] for this game. Besides deluxe and whatever the hell there is there are multiple season passes of which only one is included in the deluxe (lmao?) and you can buy skins for 10€ each as well! Oh what joy! Fu***ng ridiculous. I know previous Borderlands title had additional paid content as well but nowhere near this level of monetization and greediness. Back then you could buy skins for like 2€ each and yes I know that was years ago, but these skins you pay 10€ you can literally recreate in game with the color changing I mentioned much earlier. Other than that I guess the last thing I would mention is [b]the menu and UI,[/b] its pretty for sure but not very user friendly. The map and item transferring got me kinda struggling many times. Not sure if I left anything out, maybe I'll remember some things later and add, maybe not. But I got my point across. Thanks for reading my review.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.

Personally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. 

The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.

I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.

Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.",finished first playthrough game put 57 9 hour point completed content 100 outside steam trophy personally really enjoyed game think great release everything ever wanted harry potter game story good voice acting actually phenomenal part non player character player character slight issue robotic voice likely due pitch nothing game breaking combat engaging though lament lack variety come enemy confront hogwarts world represented incredible detail lost running castle taking gripe game sadly hope fixed line lack photo mode example animation issue certain foe like troll rubberband follow player character complete animation said lack enemy variety well wish mission school focused around student life quickly feel like part time student castle lack bit class take learn universe even student activity like quidditch wizard chess outside slight gripe game think avalanche terrific job bringing universe harry potter life game look forward future may via dlc potential similar game exploring part wizarding world academy like ilvermorny beauxbâtons durmstrang even story focused around adult universe ministry believe lot people may enjoy playing auror unspeakable
594650,Hunt: Showdown,"I only play as a solo, never on a team (haven't even tried to). In my [strike]65+[/strike] 90+ hours playing as a solo hunter, I have experienced:
[list]
[*]No lag
[*]No frame-rate issues
[*]and have been killed by other hunters far more than I've killed them (because I'm just not as great a player as I'd like to be)
[/list]
I've also had a ton of fun with this game. I primarily farm PvE and only occasionally seek out PvP (though it finds me plenty). I've even managed to take out a couple of two-hunter teams. I'm sure others are like ""[i]pffff, so what? I do that [b]all the time[/b]![/i]"" but for me that was quite difficult and made for very proud moments. The PvE is fun, and the PvP is also fun.

The 1800s firearms are just super duper well done. Reloading animations take forever (as they should with these guns), in a far more realistic way than most FPS games. When I press the button to reload my revolver, the animation is: I hold the gun up, open the loading port, eject the spent casing, load in a fresh bullet, revolve the cylinder and repeat until fully loaded, close the loading port, spin the cylinder, and pull the hammer back. Firing and reloading are just [b]so satisfying[/b], coming from the perspective that I love these old firearms and enjoy the immersion/realism that goes into their operation in the game. 

The guns and gun-play are the main things that draw me to the game. I'd love to see a single-player campaign for this, either as content for Showdown or as a separate stand-alone title. I'd play the ever-loving tar out of that too.

The sound design in the game is absolutely [b][u][i]top notch[/i][/u][/b]. Hearing footsteps, broken glass being tread upon, chains rattling, doors opening, etc. all around you is very important. The directional audio is second to none and can help to keep you alive if you are paying attention. Gunshots can be heard from across the map, and each gun (or gun type at least) has it's own sound. You can tell what type of gun someone is using, and approximately how far away they are, and in which direction from the sound that is generated. 

The hunt is on, and I'm ready to die over and over again in my pursuit of these bounties.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"If you're a fan of Kingdom Come Deliverance but don't enjoy heavy combat or want more freedom to customize, this is a great game for you. If you like building and survival simulators and cozy vibes, this is the game for you. If you need complicated and in depth story lines with a lot of voice acting, this is not the game for you. If you like games like Green Hell, Stranded Deep, The Forest simply for their highly customizable building, this game is not for you. 

This game offers a very cozy atmosphere with a strong survival aspect (fall/injury damage, sickness, hunger, thirst, weight limits, exhaustion - but no sleep needs) and a lot of freedom. You immediately have the right to build but your building limit is based on completing one of the main quests. The main & side quests are cute and quirky, sometimes easy and sometimes challenging, and add a sense of liveliness to the game.

Your success in this game is based a lot on your reputation as a citizen of this valley and how well you treat others. You can invite people to your village based on their skills and your needs, and can romance (but this takes time, tact, and money!), but you need to take care of every villager's needs or they will leave. You must provide food, firewood, water, jobs, and shelter. In return, they give you free labour and you can quickly develop a self-sufficient village that requires only a little maintenance from you.

The environments are beautiful. There are open fields, deep forests, mountains, a lake, rivers, caves, and ponds. There are tons of animals, crop types, and different tasks and occupations. There are a lot of different money-making routes. There are some bandits but you can turn this off. Mostly you need to worry about your survival needs, and wolves and boars. I genuinely have become obsessed with the idea of doing building challenges in the different terrains.

Overall this has become an ultimate comfort game for me and I highly recommend it if you like cozy games without being too cutesy and has some realism.",fan kingdom come deliverance enjoy heavy combat want freedom customize great game like building survival simulator cozy vibe game need complicated depth story line lot voice acting game like game like green hell stranded deep forest simply highly customizable building game game offer cozy atmosphere strong survival aspect fall injury damage sickness hunger thirst weight limit exhaustion sleep need lot freedom immediately right build building limit based completing one main quest main side quest cute quirky sometimes easy sometimes challenging add sense liveliness game success game based lot reputation citizen valley well treat others invite people village based skill need romance take time tact money need take care every villager need leave must provide food firewood water job shelter return give free labour quickly develop self sufficient village requires little maintenance environment beautiful open field deep forest mountain lake river cave pond ton animal crop type different task occupation lot different money making route bandit turn mostly need worry survival need wolf boar genuinely become obsessed idea building challenge different terrain overall become ultimate comfort game highly recommend like cozy game without cutesy realism

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"I had no intention of playing Baldur's Gate 3; I barely played 1 and missed 2.  And I just don't have 200 hours to sink into an 80 GB RPG at my age.  I enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin and couch co-op'd with my wife in D:OS 2, but we have a mortgage and a dog and no time.

Then I read the Tweet.  You know the one: the prominent game developer who said that we cannot allow Larian to define our expectations of RPGs.  Oh, really?  I immediately bought the game and spent hours downloading it out of pure, unadulterated spite.

I am 3 hours in.  Three.  I am blown away.  I spent the first hour creating my character.  I pulled out my Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook and marveled at what BG3 had enabled me to do - this is the full blown 5E character creation.  The maniacs at Larian  took Divinity: Original Sin and made it into D&D 5E, full stop.  Amazing.

And then I played for a couple of hours.

I haven't fallen in love with a game like this since Dragon Age: Origins and there is so much more depth to BG3 in the short time I've played.  Case in point: I found a lockpick, broke into a crypt, looted a burial site and was promptly incinerated by a flame trap over a greased floor.  Thank you, Larian, for reminding me of the F5 key.

The graphics are amazing.  The voice work is the best.  The cut scenes are riveting and that's usually when I go make another whisky!  The sound design is unbelievable.  Why am I noticing sound design?  I don't care about sound design!

I've misclicked so many times.  There's so much to click!  I've died in so many ways.  There are so many ways to die!  There are so many bugs, but I don't even care because in a game as complex and deep as this, you're going to experience lots and lots of FUN. 

Larian, you've done it.  You've made a game so incredible that other developers are banding together to warn us not to play your magnum opus or we won't enjoy the next Stranger Things Click Quest game or whatever garbage they're shoveling out.  

I cannot wait to spend days in Baldur's Gate 3.


* Edit 8/1/2023 after ~60 hours *

Since this review got some attention, let me give you an update after about 60 hours of Early Access.  My initial review is, obviously, hyperbolic, but that was my real-time reaction to finding a truly great game in a genre and style that I thought had been abandoned by game producers who are more interested in games as service, micro-transactions and shooters.

The best review of BG3 I could give is that this is the game I've been hoping for since Dragon Age: Origins.  I play games for systems, not so much story, and I really like both the systems and the story of this game.  If I really like a game, I look forward to starting over and trying something new (I play XCOM 2 and Dwarf Fortress a little bit.)  This game also scratches that itch, which seems strange to say about a story-driven RPG, but it really is a game that encourages you to experiment.

As it stands, on the verge of release, this game is a 10/10 for me and in my pantheon of favorites.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"Ok let's get right into it and I'm not going to sugar coat anything. As a preface, I am a long time, 20-year Halo fan who's been positively impacted by Halo and all the experiences that came from it.  I've done it all, split screen and LAN parties all night to finally getting internet to play Halo 3 online when that came out. I absolutely love Halo and everything about it. Therefore, it saddens me greatly to see the current state of Halo (and gaming in general). 343 had 6 years to get this game right, 6 YEARS and they still mostly flopped. By wanting to ""reach a broader audience"" they watered down and ruined the identity of Halo. This is nothing more than a theft of a beloved IP, using its name to steal money from the consumers. 343 AND Microsoft (yes, we can't only blame 343 because this is Microsofts flagship IP, afterall) ruined this franchise.

The only positive things about this game are that the gameplay and campaign are actually pretty decent. Other than that, we don't have Forge and we have no idea when or if that's going to happen, no split screen or co-op campaign, no progressions system, customization is in shambles and locked behind paywalls. It's garbage. They claim that the multiplayer is free to play but is it really? We all know that most of us got the campaign when it came out which was $60. That's the typical price for a game with both single and multiplayer. So really, this ""free to play"" multiplayer seems like an excuse for Microsoft and 343 to have their atrocious online store and battle pass systems. Absolutely pathetic and disgraceful.

Really the whole AAA gaming industry is pathetic and disgraceful. How many more Cyberpunks, GTA Onlines (the current and upcoming plans for it, anyways), Battlefield 2042's, Call of Duty's, and Halo: Infinite's are we going to take before something changes? I don't care if 343 gets this game to a completed state NEXT YEAR because this should have been completed on release. That's what I expected when I payed for this game (or any game) to be - in a completed state on release. Not having forge, customization, a progression system, theater, split-screen, co-op campaign, etc. is the Battlefield 2042 equivalent of calling a scoreboard and voice-chat ""legacy features"".

Do not recommend and never will until 343/Microsoft/the gaming industry, have finally and truly learned their lesson.

236390,War Thunder,"Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin's head office.

Let me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:
A bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you're signing up for. Also the first serious review I've done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it's about time I told (warned) people about it.

The devs:
Has never listened to it's community's suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said ""no"" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn't figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. 

The grind:
dear god the insane grind, if you don't get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won't see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.

New vehicles:
Anytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the ""op vehicles."" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don't address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. 

The maps:
Only 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless ""unintended"" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that's right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there's 1 2 or 3. Yup that's all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin's inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT's... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but ""are accurate to a real life location.""

Helicopters:
Two words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won't cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you're in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don't even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you're forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli's. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I'm grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I'm not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there's 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli's. 

Air realistic battles: 
have 1 single game mode variant and it hasn't changed at all since it's introduction to the game back in 2011. It's fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn't really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they're ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can't respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.


It reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. 

Game modes: 

Realistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren't enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don't even have any for certain BR's (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Apparently played over 150 hours of this game, so here are some thoughts:

Positives
- Gorgeous world, I'm often blown away by how pretty the landscape is
- The basic gameplay loop is really enjoyable with being tasked to gather resources to craft buildings and provide homes to your villagers
- Early game can definitely feel rough and offers a bit of an interesting challenge to new players
- Any setting can be changed in-game any time you want to make the game easier or more difficult

Negatives
- The game is oddly paced with a lot to do in the beginning to the point you can feel stressed out and overwhelmed but as you overcome that hurdle you suddenly find yourself with nothing to do
- City management could become more complex where upgrading houses and providing more complex or better foods and other amenities to your citizens are relevant, so you feel you actually build a real village
- A lack of a proper end game; eventually you just wait for the days to pass so you can see your heir turn 18 years old but game doesn't start over or take a new turn at that point, but it just continues where your main character at that point died (there is an update trying to address this to some extent, so this may not be relevant after the Q3 update)
- I wish I could feel more involved in the lives of my citizens; fetch quests do little to develop them as characters that you look after (it would help if your village would face real challenges here, such as your citizens becoming sick, be attacked by wild animals or bandits and the like in addition to your villages having unique personalities and desires)

In summary, I feel mixed about the game. It has some really nice positive aspects but the game is thoroughly lacking follow through and content in several areas to make you want to come back for more. The most fun part of the game is the early stages where you are still lacking a home and struggling for survival and money, and still staking out where you want to settle and how to do it. 

They also need to seriously balance the hunting mechanic because the amount of food you can make by manually choosing to hunt wild animals is ridiculous. Even hunting rabbits with your bare fists is easy and fixes all your food problems early on. I would envision that animal meat should be valued more, and that hunger needs to be better balanced in this area without being oppressive. Killing a deer should net lots of food that lasts longer compared to a rabbit. 

Winters also need to be much harsher with clothing and heating actually being truly relevant not just to yourself, but also to your citizens. Would also love to see more focus spent on farming with crops failing to mature due to harsh weather conditions, struck by blight and the like, so it feels like a genuine struggle for survival even after your settlement is up and running. Right now farming is ridiculously powerful as all good foods rely on farming-related products so alternatives would be nice and that citizens want better quality food or you could theoretically supply them with grilled meat all day.

Compared to others I am fine with the travel system as is but it could be nice if you could hitch a hike with local travelers to stay on their wagon to fast travel between city points at least, or potentially rent a horse or a donkey for a fee. I would also love to see wandering merchants beyond the merchants that show up at the taverns (including yours once you built one). While I am at taverns, alcohol currently serves no purpose in the game either, and also looks like one of these elements that come across as mostly unrealized ideas - i.e. citizens are intended to gain bonuses by providing them alcohol, but currently that bonus isn't there at all. Or potentially being able to host festivals once you built a market square or a tavern or some such. 

And as I mentioned before - since you actually spend many years with your citizens, the ability to build meaningful relationships with them would be extremely nice as in they have their personalities and they expect you to come socialize with them and ask them how they're doing once in a while, they got their own unique needs based on their personalities and it gives them certain boons and downsides e.g. maybe one is a morning person so they're up earlier to work than the others but instead likes to drink more alcohol and gets drunk more easily and causes problems with the other villagers and so on. It would go a long way in making the village you build feel alive and that there's something more to address than building homes and solving fetch quests. It would also pose you with problems such as maybe you need to kick that villager out because they're actually a liability to you, but they got a family with children and do you really want to make them homeless as it will drastically reduce your citizens' trust in you? 

And I think this summarizes how I feel about the game a lot - there's a lot of potential with a lot of great ideas, but a lot of the time it feels like the game is just not developing these ideas to the fullest. As a result, it feels like the game is just lacking a lot of depth - it's pretty and the basics are there, but there isn't a lot to do beyond it. I hope the devs will continue to develop the game in ways that deepen the gameplay.

Otherwise I can only really recommend it based on that it's not a very expensive game and it offers some casual fun early, but unfortunately the game also lacks that something that makes you want to stick around for longer.",apparently played 150 hour game thought positive gorgeous world often blown away pretty landscape basic gameplay loop really enjoyable tasked gather resource craft building provide home villager early game definitely feel rough offer bit interesting challenge new player setting changed game time want make game easier difficult negative game oddly paced lot beginning point feel stressed overwhelmed overcome hurdle suddenly find nothing city management could become complex upgrading house providing complex better food amenity citizen relevant feel actually build real village lack proper end game eventually wait day pas see heir turn 18 year old game start take new turn point continues main character point died update trying address extent may relevant q3 update wish could feel involved life citizen fetch quest little develop character look would help village would face real challenge citizen becoming sick attacked wild animal bandit like addition village unique personality desire summary feel mixed game really nice positive aspect game thoroughly lacking follow content several area make want come back fun part game early stage still lacking home struggling survival money still staking want settle also need seriously balance hunting mechanic amount food make manually choosing hunt wild animal ridiculous even hunting rabbit bare fist easy fix food problem early would envision animal meat valued hunger need better balanced area without oppressive killing deer net lot food last longer compared rabbit winter also need much harsher clothing heating actually truly relevant also citizen would also love see focus spent farming crop failing mature due harsh weather condition struck blight like feel like genuine struggle survival even settlement running right farming ridiculously powerful good food rely farming related product alternative would nice citizen want better quality food could theoretically supply grilled meat day compared others fine travel system could nice could hitch hike local traveler stay wagon fast travel city point least potentially rent horse donkey fee would also love see wandering merchant beyond merchant show tavern including built one tavern alcohol currently serf purpose game either also look like one element come across mostly unrealized idea e citizen intended gain bonus providing alcohol currently bonus potentially able host festival built market square tavern mentioned since actually spend many year citizen ability build meaningful relationship would extremely nice personality expect come socialize ask got unique need based personality give certain boon downside e g maybe one morning person earlier work others instead like drink alcohol get drunk easily cause problem villager would go long way making village build feel alive something address building home solving fetch quest would also pose problem maybe need kick villager actually liability got family child really want make homeless drastically reduce citizen trust think summarizes feel game lot lot potential lot great idea lot time feel like game developing idea fullest result feel like game lacking lot depth pretty basic lot beyond hope devs continue develop game way deepen gameplay otherwise really recommend based expensive game offer casual fun early unfortunately game also lack something make want stick around longer

This game seems short on content and options compared to other city builders.

That moment you find yourself in, after spending 3 hours building a dam, watching the water back up and you marvelling at your engineering prowess... when the water goes around the mountain, through a gap you never saw, and floods your town in 20 feet of water and everything stops.... is priceless.

That's when you realise that's where the fun is.

And sometimes... there's just no water at all and all your beavers die... because your engineering prowess is actually not very good at all.

MSFS2020 is simply put: a next gen flight simulator. Everything is indeed a step forwarded compared to older simulators. Cities with 3D models look amazing, cities with AI buildings also look cool, but of course they aren't entirely modeled.

To the Simulator itself: I have been flying mostly small aircraft exploring the world and doing simple IFR flight here and there. I have yet to find a bug or something weird that ruined my experience. I know a lot of people are complaining about the Flight Management computers in airliners being fucked, as well as the autopilot. These are extremely complex systems and quite honestly, I would be extremely surprised if they got some study-material aircraft perfectly at launch. Physics wise this is also very interesting. It's still not perfect, but it's getting better. Topographic turbulence and weather changes are becoming somewhat realistic. 

Long story short, this is obviously a classic and will become the new industry standard. If you are here for big planes and exact real life procedures, you might want to do that when third parties start releasing their products.

The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.

I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.

Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.

For years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year.

All went well and good until the pirates started attacking right when I send half my colony to search through an ancient tome.
Toni was unlucky and got knocked down by the brute power of the pirates. After struggling to defend the right of my colonists, the pirates retreated with Toni as their loot.

Kelly was heartbroken and suffered many mental breaks.

Three years later, the same pirates started attacking once again and guess who joined their squad?... Yes, it was Toni. 
A big fight was going on different locations and then Toni got face to face with Kelly. Toni didn't hesitate and shot the poor Kelly down. Took her with him and fled the field of combat.

311210,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*

     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. 
Please google ""Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022"". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. 

TL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.

Now for my review:
     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the ""popular"" maps. The ""less popular"" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.
     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024!

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"This is, simply put, my favourite game. 

There's nothing quite like Hunt out there. 
It's a difficult, challenging PvPvE game. You play as a bounty hunter tasked with killing a high value target in an area infested with some sort of dark magic. The only problem is, you're not the only hunter out there. 

You collect clues to locate the target, you kill the target, you banish the target.... then you have to escape the map with tokens proving it's you who killed it. 
Maps can hold 12 players, which means there will be 10 more people who are intent on stopping you leaving with that bounty. And almost everything you do can be heard by everyone else on the map, meaning you have to move as quickly as you can, whilst going as quietly as necessary. 

The gameplay loop is incredibly satisfying, with the right balance of risk and reward. Most things you do in a match earn you an amount of cash to take to the next lobby, where you can then either save for a rainy day, or buy higher tier equipment for your next loadout. But, anything you die with is lost to the bayou - hence the risk. If your hunter survives, they get experience and you can use that to buy some traits that make them marginally better for the next run out. 

This system sounds like a ""win more"" system, where success leads to a higher probability of success on the next run, and so it seems inevitable that the good get better equipment to be even more effective - so how can a new player break in?
The answer is quite simple; all equipment has a situation where it's the best choice. The starting rifle has a larger magazine than most other guns in the game and shoots more quickly, so favours closer quarters fighting. The starting shotgun has the longest one-hit-kill range of all the shotguns. Ultimately, playing to your loadout's strengths and being better than your opponent has a FAR higher contribution to your success than the exact equipment everyone loaded in with.

The barrier to a new player is therefore not an insurmountable equipment difference, it's learning the game. There are (currently) three VERY full maps, each of which is absolutely crammed with minutiae. It's about knowing how to move around compounds without triggering sound traps quickly. It's about knowing which directions you're actually vulnerable from. It's about knowing which sort of gun can shoot through that wooden wall you know they're crouched behind. It's about knowing that when the shot sounds like THAT, that means it's this specific gun and how far away they are. The burden of knowledge you have to accumulate to become proficient is very high. 

It's this burden of knowledge which is the thing you, as a potential buyer, have to consider. 
Are you prepared to get shot from places you don't understand for 20 hours? Are you prepared to be surprised by what their equipment did? You will likely die a lot before you get good. 

But when you DO become proficient, there is nothing like this game. 
Nothing replicates the thrill of you and a partner (or two) methodically outmanoeuvring another team and taking them down. 

Another (major) point in the ""pro"" column is the developer team. They are extremely active with the community, and listen to and implement suggestions from the community very proactively. They are continually improving the game and adding loads of content. I have bought a lot of the (cosmetic) DLC, purely to support the team, as I have gotten way more out of the game than the price I paid to get in.

Despite every other shooter I try, I keep coming back to Hunt. As long as there are other hunters to go up against, I think I might never stop.",simply put favourite game nothing quite like hunt difficult challenging pvpve game play bounty hunter tasked killing high value target area infested sort dark magic problem hunter collect clue locate target kill target banish target escape map token proving killed map hold 12 player mean 10 people intent stopping leaving bounty almost everything heard everyone else map meaning move quickly whilst going quietly necessary gameplay loop incredibly satisfying right balance risk reward thing match earn amount cash take next lobby either save rainy day buy higher tier equipment next loadout anything die lost bayou hence risk hunter survives get experience use buy trait make marginally better next run system sound like win system success lead higher probability success next run seems inevitable good get better equipment even effective new player break answer quite simple equipment situation best choice starting rifle larger magazine gun game shoot quickly favour closer quarter fighting starting shotgun longest one hit kill range shotgun ultimately playing loadout strength better opponent far higher contribution success exact equipment everyone loaded barrier new player therefore insurmountable equipment difference learning game currently three full map absolutely crammed minutia knowing move around compound without triggering sound trap quickly knowing direction actually vulnerable knowing sort gun shoot wooden wall know crouched behind knowing shot sound like mean specific gun far away burden knowledge accumulate become proficient high burden knowledge thing potential buyer consider prepared get shot place understand 20 hour prepared surprised equipment likely die lot get good become proficient nothing like game nothing replicates thrill partner two methodically outmanoeuvring another team taking another major point pro column developer team extremely active community listen implement suggestion community proactively continually improving game adding load content bought lot cosmetic dlc purely support team gotten way game price paid get despite every shooter try keep coming back hunt long hunter go think might never stop

Hopefully, all of the issues will eventually be fixed but in it's current state, playing beyond Act 3 will simply be a terrible experience for you.

The writing in act 1 and 2 is very good and faithful the 40k universe, the gameplay can be complicated at times but that's to be expected for a crpg. I overall had a great experience playing the first half of the game.

However, after act 3, everything goes downhill in terms of quality.
I had to use mods to trigger / fix every companion questline in act 4 except for one.
Act 4 barely adds any new side-content, having done everything available before progressing to act 3, act 4 felt very empty and rushed.
Gameplay-wise, there seems to be something clearly broken with the balancing, the Arch-militant archetype simply scales way too fast in combat, paired with two support oriented officers and i could clear every single combat encounter starting in act 3 before the ennemy had the chance to play a turn in ""hard"" difficulty. At that point, i was simply in it for the writing and just wanted to get it over with honestly.
But even the writing felt way less interesting in act 4 and 5.

1326470,Sons Of The Forest,"This is an early access review before the first update.
I have completed the game after roughly 25 hours of playtime. 

Positives: 
- The NPC's bring a nice change to people who want to play this game but dont have the friends to do so.
- Graphically looks beautiful. Especially with the changing seasons.
- A ton of weapon options.
- The build mode has taken a huge improvement over the original.
- Combat feels better than the original. (Minus the handgun, it feels really weird to use)
- The new weather system really does help the world feel more alive.
- The 3D printer is a VERY good addition. It adds a sort of ""shop"" feel. But I feel we need more options in this printer.
- The sled is a TON of fun.
- The addition of peaceful mode allows this game to be accessible to anyone. 
- The addition of a GPS is VERY appreciated and makes navigation much easier.
- Sharing / passing inventory items to coop members is a huge improvement for teamwork.


Negatives:
- A very lacking world. Theres like 7 animals on the entire island. Deer, Moose, Squirrel, Rabbit, Turtle, and Bird, and fish.
- The story is somehow even more bare-bones than the original. The only means to progress the story is through emails that you can find printed out around the island. Theres also literally only one line of dialogue in the entire game. At that point, why even have it? Everyone just gestures and makes grunts instead of talking. 
- There are multiple caves that are completely empty and serve next to no purpose outside of providing minor resources.
- The caves that arent instant dead-ends feel shorter and less dynamic compared to the original. (For example, in the original you were using the climbing axe to navigate an extremely deep cave.) 
- Not all of the original mutations are in this game. And the mutations that are in this game are nowhere as threatening as the original. The only real threat is in the final lab where you fight the final mutation because its very fast and does 2 armor per hit.
- The ending is absolutely horrible. It drops SUPER abruptly. There isnt a final boss or big fight at the end. Its just a really big room with about 20 or so of the final mutation. Which can be easily handled with the cross. 


Bugs:
- Rotten food can still be cooked and it will turn into ""cooked"" food which can be eaten like normal.
- The GPS tracker does not use any of the custom icons. They will default always to the radio icon regardless of what you chose.
- Virginia can sometimes just disappear and cannot be found. Im not sure what causes this to happen but it seems to be random.
- Kalvin's AI is hilariously bad. For every one correct thing he does, he breaks three other things. Hes just a liability and youre better off telling him to just stay in rest til the end of the game so that you can get the achievement. I feel he would serve a better purpose being able to help you in combat like with Virginia.
- Multiple achievements are bugged / do not work correctly in multiplayer. 
- If you are building and get attacked by a cannibal, the structure gets bugged and will not let you build on to it anymore.
- Multiple items will get stuck to your hand when hit in the middle of an animation. Stuff as minor as weapon visual bugs or something major like being hit while picking up a cannibal body will just have a cannibals butt in your face until you leave the game. 
- Sometimes coop player's will not show up on the map. But they are visible on the overworld. 


Minor complaints: 
- Deer absolutely BOOK it. I get that this is to encourage the ""stealth"" but they will hear a leaf and just instantly run to a different zip code. This makes hunting deer in the early game next to impossible. Compared to the original where they will stop running to give you a chance to catch up and take them down with the axe.
- Speaking of stealth, this mechanic serves next to no purpose at all. Cannibals and mutants will still spot you even if youre crouched in a bush. 
- Base building is basically unessential. The best way to play this game is being as nomadic as possible. Settling down will just get you invaded by cannibals. And you dont really need a place to store your food and resources because the game lets you hold an incredible amount just on your back. And with crates and boxes littered all over the island you are almost always good on resources.
- You are able to give weapons to Virginia but you have to give YOUR weapons. There are multiple spawn locations for the handgun and the shotgun. But you cannot carry more than one at the same time. This makes it incredibly annoying trying to give your weapons to her. Let us hold the other guns so that we can give them to Virginia later. (Just like how we cant equip any of the Kelvin / Virginia clothing.)
- The NPCs do not follow you into any cave. While I get its somewhat harder to program, they would be a bigger help in the caves as that is where youre going to spend MOST of your fighting. 
- It would be nice to have a crafting book, similar to the survival guide book. Basically asking for the option to fast craft previously unlocked recipes. It would also be nice to let us craft in bulk. So that we dont have to rewatch the animation each time.
- Unless im mistaken, firewood serves next to no purpose. It just sits there and looks pretty but you cannot use it.
- The game does not tell you that the GPS can be zoomed out and zoomed in with middle mouse. This is a HUGE improvement over the standard GPS size. 
- Not being able to like full screen the map and have a clear and full view over the entire island. The best you can get is a 1/3rd view. You also cannot have a compass so it is somewhat easy to lose your way around unless you use a third-party map service.
- The turtle shell serves no purpose at all. This was used in the original as a way to collect rain water but that recipe is not currently in the game.
- There is no penalty for not eating/drinking/sleeping outside of a lower stamina bar.
- There is no penalty for eating raw/rotten/poison food. Your character will just cough and then shake it off immediately. 
- The garden plot is only used for one plant at a time. Which is hilariously bad compared to the original. 
- The shovel is ONLY used for story progression / minor loot spots. I was hoping that this could be used for land excavation / setting up traps.
- The mountain serves no purpose aside from just being fun to sled off of. Theres no items, enemies, or animals all over the area. Its completely barren and devoid of meaning. 
- The shark is hilariously under powered. Really making it an ACHIEVEMENT to die by it. Because they bite you once and run away and the bite is WAY too minimal on damage. It took about 20 minutes of just annoying this shark to die by it. 

Suggestions: 
- We dont need 3 different Axes if they all serve the same purpose with minimal stat changes. Either make the axes have a MUCH wider stat range, or give them unique interactions with the world.
- Please add more animals. Maybe even some hostile ones like bears or something. 
- Winter is the only season that brings a survival change. It makes you manage your heat but I hardly noticed a difference of being cold outside of a minor stamina penalty. Maybe include a sickness for ignoring this warning. And let us craft medicine using some of the healing plants. 
- On a similar note, we should include a survival change with summer as well. Maybe have us dehydrate faster or something.
- Please bring back the original mutations and add more.

Overall: 
This game has a ton of potential to be a true successor to the original. 
While I get this is early access, I feel this is EARLY early access. Its just way too soon to genuinely play this game.
Unless youre just in it for the base building and just being in a pretty world.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Although it has been almost a month since I quit this game, I'm going to write this review in the hope that new players will have a basic understanding of what they are about to get themselves into. Not saying that you shouldn't TRY the game (it's free so why wouldn't you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark's gameplay loop.

TL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team's intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day.

Korean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game's fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don't be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you've likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as ""demons"". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you'll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue.

The early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won't be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity.

Reaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you'll enter what the game refers to as ""Tier 1"" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una's tasks (which are again either ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" quests), and weekly three Una's tasks (which are again mostly just ""kill X"" or ""fetch X"" except scaled up).

The progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset.

For the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won't meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you're in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids.

By the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you'll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don't have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account.

If you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game's launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished. All of your time, effort, and money invested in the game gone in an instant with no chance to get it back.

By all means, try this game out but don't let it hook you in. It's worth a few hours of your time but nothing more.",although almost month since quit game going write review hope new player basic understanding get saying try game free hope time reach point game feel like need swipe credit card start feeling need keep playing game even cost neglecting real life responsibility able make educated decision whether want keep p l aying break vicious cycle lost ark gameplay loop tl dr lost ark well polished game amazing action combat fun class stunning visuals however pro meant draw player whereby fall prey dev team intentionally predatory pay win mechanic slog hour repetitive task six character every day get verbally abused gatekept toxic elitist community get randomly banned game reason game intended average joe hold 9 5 day job 2 hour average play game every weekday targeted either single rich people responsibility dependent afford throw truckloads cash game single poor people responsibility dependent afford play game 16 hour every day korean mmos notorious top tier gameplay stunning visuals graphic punishing amount grinding pay win mechanic designed philosophy rich people always dominate poor people every aspect life lost ark unfortunately exception doctrine new player upon starting game immediately wowed game fantastic graphic polished zone fun action combat fooled fish devs want catch pretty graphic amazing gameplay bait use hook story game mediocre mainly generic medieval fantasy garbage likely seen many previous mmos rpg game bad guy world even generically named demon reading line story dialogue soon become lost confused regard story going eventually end skipping majority quest dialogue early game level 1 50 mostly consists following main story quest countless number generic kill x fetch x side quest dungeon run part main story optionally part side quest dungeon well designed unfortunately able team anyone run early game completely devoid real human player companion point hundred bot train run around zone impunity reaching level 50 new player likely take anywhere 8 40 hour gameplay depending whether speedrunning zone taking time stop smell rose hit level 50 enter game refers tier 1 progression currently three tier progression 1 2 3 current highest tier establish daily routine rest lost ark consist daily two chaos dungeon run daily two guardian run daily three una task either kill x fetch x quest weekly three una task mostly kill x fetch x except scaled progression tier 1 tier 3 streamlined since game release still quite chore slog especially since point game unlikely encountered single human player guardian run nearly impossible solo new player basically unplayable human player run chaos dungeon braindead solo instance mash many button kill many mob possible picking loot log daily daily done vertical progression day capped nothing except wait next day daily reset next 50 100 hour slog way t1 t2 t2 t3 repetitive daily routine chaos dungeon fetch quest kill quest whole time meet single real human player reach t3 t3 also real grind start thought point repetitive boring nope grind life also point predatory pay win mechanic game start show upgrading gear rng based go higher chance succeeding drop significantly lower cost upgrade attempt skyrocket point farming daily single character enough make sort meaningful progress reasonable timeframe two choice point 1 create alt character push t3 farm daily character daily reward per character per account get material upgrade main character 2 pull credit card player combination resulting spending unhealthy number hour playing game every day also ungodly amount money game overcome artificial barrier put devs preventing participating best content lost ark offer legion raid time progress far enough game meet minimum requirement run first legion raid find nobody want take majority player game already far ahead patience teach raid actually quite challenging require fail time practice player still play game point hardcore gamers 20 alt character need farm daily every day every minute spend teaching farming alt minute making gold barrier playing fun content game high impossible anyone surmount unless play large dedicated group friend willing empty entire bank account still quit game likely forced ag publisher lost ark permanently ban violating code conduct ban happen randomly without warning appeal automatically denied explanation ban given lost ark worst infestation bot rmters possibly ever existed mmo point ag incompetent effort lessen problem ended making thing worse legitimate innocent player get banned daily basis blatant rmters around since game launch stream buying entire lost ark economy broad daylight still go unpunished time effort money invested game gone instant chance get back mean try game let hook worth hour time nothing
1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"the only crime Arthur is guilty of, is stealing my heart",crime arthur guilty stealing heart
1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Rewriting this partially as of 07.10.2023, decided to return and check what changed in a year.

If you are here to consider buying it, I would say it's worth it for the base price and with low expectations. The gameplay slaps, but most of the systems around it are flawed in one way or another.

A lot of things that weres bad on release have changed, but the games still pretty far from ideal, plus FS decided to double dip into MTX shop, selling skins costing roughly $12+ for ONE character. And don't forget, it's been a year since release, so the game finally reached the ""mostly release-ready"" state in 11 months of work. *slow claps*


Let me get this straight - Fatshark as a company are lying on a regular basis.
Fatshark straight up lied at advertising. A lot of promo material weapons or cosmetics are unobtainable in game at launch, ability to obtain premium currency through gameplay was removed (and they were sneaky enough to edit this out of the discord post right before release), the crafting system that was supposed to be ready on release was added several months later. The promised story, but just used Dan Abnett big name as a promotion and in fact story does not exist at all, aside from couple of cutscenes. Weapon modifications system is scrapped , so you can't just attach flashlight/bayonet to a gun or get a better scope, despite it apparently being in the works not so long ago (but modders were able to restore it, so maybe FS will go through with it eventually).


Release of the game that happened 30.11.2022 in not an actual release, it misses key features, and game stability was absolutely awful. You probably should already realise that from 54% all time reviews. Atm a year later it's relatively smooth sailing, but again - releasing the game in that state was an awful idea.

A year later crafting notably improved, but new player will be met with a wall of grind to get the proper rolled weapon, find good blessings for the library and all that.
The game still have Division 2 levels of loot stats distribution, making all weapons with bad base stats garbage even if properties and perks are amazing. This is still not addressed, so the game still wants you to check shop once per hour.

Amount of content is still questionable, but much less so. Game currently features only 4 classes with 3 subclasses, making it 12 (opposed to 15 free classes V2 had on release) and amost every map in the game have a reused fragments of another map in that same location. 
Essentially, Weaves from V2 (same maps, but run backwards). Also, there is much more copypasted sequences (like defending while hacking servo skulls or killing small daemo-grown tentacles, these two appear on a lot of maps), which is mostly not the case for V2 where most of the events are unique and tied to a map. Plus, almost all weapons for 3/4 characters are literally the same weapons, every class have access to couple of unique items, but all generic rifles/axes/swords are the same for each class, diluting loot pool. Only Ogryn gets a full set of unique weapons, but then he have very limited options. Sadly, im not rewriting this, as FS added almost nothing new in weapon department in a year of work, and most described problems still apply. At least they reworked some weapons to stop being so bad. 

The game still reeks of ""effective management"", ""players engagement"" and ""retention"" a year later. Also, in game shop exploiting FOMO and does not allow you to buy items directly, instead forcing you to buy aquilas in packs and then spending aquilas on cosmetics. This is still true a year later, and it's becoming worse with introduction of ""premium skins"" that are just the most popular regiment like Steel . Do not support this BS, vote with your wallet. No skin in a game worth $10+. Also, just to give you insight, when initial backlash to MTX was addressed, they promised to add the 100 aquilas bundle, that would solve some problems with the shop.It was added, but it is hidden from the shop, and only shows when you try to purchase the item you missing 100 or less aquilas. Isn't that convenient, eh?

The ingame mictrotransactions shop is taken directly from Fortnite or similar games, displaying only one set of cosmetics for each character at the time which got swapped each ~7-10 days. It initially had timers, which were removed after community backlash, but this is still exploiting FOMO, don't be fooled. Also, they added a ""convenient"" bundle to buy the most expensive skin sets with a direct price of ~10,5$ per skin (this is dinda funny, after initial negativiy the head of the studio said in the interview that they SIMPLY FORGOT to release this pack, of course, we totally believe this). For anything less than the most luxury pack you still need to sit in the shop with a calculator and try to figure out how much you want to spend and how much unused aquilas will be sitting in your inventory after you finished. And just to clarify - yes, the game is released in poor tech state, missing features, a lot of maps reuse assets (literally same parts of the levels but you move through them backwards), core mechanics didnt finished, but MTX shop is ready to use and spew 2 sets of skins and 2 hats for each class every week. Kinda ironic. Aldo adding, latest datamine showed around 150 entries with cash shop interface, including full sets, weapon skins and some separate pieces, so don't worry, Fatshark loaded this shop for the very long run. TLDR - shop is using predatory anticonsumer mechanics, don't support this, dont give them your money.

And yes, people really just need to admit that after Tencent got their hands in the shares, FS just changed to worse. If you google it, chairman of the board is now chinese, same goes for non-executive, and whole bunch of staff from Level Infinite studio is listed in the credits for Darktide. In case you don't know, Level Infinite is studio that helps to design monetisation for Tencent owned projects if original studio can't make it itself. I am not putting all blame on them ofc, because this amount of incompetence and seling out should be okayed by the studio head honchos. I guess we should say thanks to them for appearance and implementation of MTX in Vermintide 2 and Darktide.

The only thing that isn't broken is core gameplay. Combat is as fun as Vermintide 2 with added gunplay, but everything else surrounding the core gameplay smells bad, from progression systems to monetisation, from craft to in game challenges (these are clearly desinged with premades in mind, good luck doing them with randoms or solo), just put your finger on it - and find it broken in some way. Even a lot of basic QoL feaatures are gone. Most of the combad bugs are fixed too, so it's much smoother than it was on launch.

Still, the last paragraph applies mostly unchanged:
The game is manifest of what is wrong with the gaming industry nowadays - barely playable unfinished releases, already loaded with microtranscations, all mechanics are tailored to make people stay in game more (I have 200 hrs in the game, and have roughly 2 pieces of gear per class that are actually good, everything else is a pile of blue garbage), not have more fun or agency in terms of equipment. Current loot and progression somehow STILL much worse than both V1 and V2, and have no respect for player time.

2157560,Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising,"This is my game of the year

When i first saw this game, i thought to myself ''meh, generic anime characters''. I don't even watch anime, so interest already wasn't that high

But hey, there's a free version... Why not try it

It just clicked pretty fast, and after a friend bought it i caved in as well

I can now say that this is one of the most complete products i've bought on launch, and it feels like it was built from the ground up with raw quality

No seriously, gacha games must be making bank because this game is just... Truly something else. I guess it was probably built off the backbone of the previous title, but as a newcomer i have no context for that

The game has probably the most visually impressive graphics for any anime game out there, character models ingame are often more visually appealing than their illustrations, expressive and emotive personalities, lots of vocals everywhere during battle, good and diverse soundtracks, clean and no overcomplicated menu or redundant buttons, good lobby systems and private room features, cute chibi avatar, and there's so many of ''the little things'' that improve the experience

This isn't a ''raw'' looking game, or a ''mechanical'' feeling one. There's always glitter on the screen and pleasing visuals, the game feels and flows good, it's just... Very nice. Not rough around the edges anywhere

There's also tons of collectibles and other stuff, and you lvl up fairly quick, while having lots of levels, which is great for consistent unlockables and keeping dopamine going

Story mode is sort of a visual novel with some 2D arcade-style gameplay. It's not just you versus some character, there are knights to fight and giant bosses with multiple health bars and mechanics. Don't get too sold on this, it's not super fancy and repetitive, but it still holds good polish, and the visual novel is animated with 3D models and fully voice acted

Also, the game offers full voice acting in english as well

This game allows you to use both simple and technical (or modern/classic, or however you want to call it) inputs, and i've come to GREATLY appreciate this system, because i like to mix and match the two as i'm learning. It's easy to input technicals in training mode, but hard to clutch it live

The only three faults with the game i can really find is training mode is worse than Street Fighter but provides the necessary features you'd need, there is no indication of connection quality to whom you fight (don't care, i'm european and out of nearing 300 matches i only had two laggers), and also you currently can't derank unless you are S-rank (or A, don't remember) which is fairly high, and leaves many people stuck

Whether this games' fighting style will appeal to you or not is not easy to articulate in a written review and you're better off watching content online to make your mind on that

But you are actually in denial if you think this isn't a high-quality product. Whether that quality is to your taste or not is another thing.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. 

Pros:
Easy to learn, hard to master.

The Questing only gets better with each expansion.

You don't NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.

Fun dungeons that don't get boring with just a couple of runs.

Tons of ""End Game"" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.

Super Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner War

If you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.

Cons:
To be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus ""crowns"" equaling the price paid for subscription""

VETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.

PvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn't the main focus of the game.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it's flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. 

-If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.

Happy adventuring, and may you meet many fine people along your journey.

756800,Contraband Police,"Some red flags to consider when shopping for ""simulator"" titles like this: 

1. When you click on the developer's name it redirects to the entire PlayWay S.A. catalog. It's common practice with PlayWay to obfuscate what games a developer worked on before their current one, especially when the current one is likely to gain traction with content creators (like this one, which is going to sell itself on ""a 3D Papers, Please."")

2. Gunplay. Sim titles like this are a hodgepodge of mechanics and ideas, usually thrown together to pad for time. First-person shooter segments are never the strong point of a simulator title and this one leans into them quite frequently. Having spent a little time with it: the guns *could* be worse but they're in no way fluid or fun. Just bog-standard, and the only real UI to facilitate shooting is a weird red dot hovering over enemies, which feels like the result of a developer realizing all the earth tones in the map and character designs means you can't actually SEE the enemies that well. The solution: a cartoon dot that you just have to aim under to get headshots every time. 

3. Too many concepts. Contraband Police could be a solid game with just the border crossing and the idea of upgrading your outpost to be more effective. Gas Station Simulator showed you can have a really jankily-built game still have a sense of progression just by hiring AI and assigning them to do your least-favorite tasks. 

Frankly, I'd much rather not have to leave the outpost and partake of the lackluster driving sequences to travel to locations I don't particularly care for. Even the shootouts where the border post gets attacked could be interesting IF the whole point was I can upgrade my post to the point it's self-reliant. Sure, I can give my guys better guns and armor but at the end of the day, I still have to throw contraband and prisoners in a van and go run chores early-game. 

From reviews I'm seeing here, I know my dream of having a Gas Station Simulator-esque border crossing where I level up my NPCs to do menial tasks automatically (perhaps even add multiple inspection lanes and let an NPC do inspections for me with the understanding they have to flag me if any real inspection is needed) are not to be. The upgrades are purely to make things stronger when random attacks happen. 

It's aggressively okay, but I worry I'll be back to this review in a few hours of gameplay with the same story most popular simulator titles have: after the first few hours they KNOW a streamer will broadcast, it drops off. Maybe it won't. For now: buy with caution.",red flag consider shopping simulator title like 1 click developer name redirects entire playway catalog common practice playway obfuscate game developer worked current one especially current one likely gain traction content creator like one going sell 3d paper please 2 gunplay sim title like hodgepodge mechanic idea usually thrown together pad time first person shooter segment never strong point simulator title one lean quite frequently spent little time gun could worse way fluid fun bog standard real ui facilitate shooting weird red dot hovering enemy feel like result developer realizing earth tone map character design mean actually see enemy well solution cartoon dot aim get headshot every time 3 many concept contraband police could solid game border crossing idea upgrading outpost effective gas station simulator showed really jankily built game still sense progression hiring ai assigning least favorite task frankly much rather leave outpost partake lackluster driving sequence travel location particularly care even shootout border post get attacked could interesting whole point upgrade post point self reliant sure give guy better gun armor end day still throw contraband prisoner van go run chore early game review seeing know dream gas station simulator esque border crossing level npc menial task automatically perhaps even add multiple inspection lane let npc inspection understanding flag real inspection needed upgrade purely make thing stronger random attack happen aggressively okay worry back review hour gameplay story popular simulator title first hour know streamer broadcast drop maybe buy caution
397540,Borderlands 3,"7.5/10
PROS:
1. GREAT GAMEPLAY - If you liked Borderlands 2, you will like this game. The movement, the guns, and the environments are awesome. The gameplay is so good it almost makes up for the shortcomings, of which there are many. Seriously, the gunplay is absolutely fantastic!
2. Loot - Once again, guns are fantastic. I always loved finding new guns/shields/relics/etc.
3. Bosses - I really liked how each boss felt different and most had interesting mechanics to go along with them, however there is also a CON here that I will get into later.
4. Skills - I played through the game as Zane, and the amount of customization to the skills and abilities is AMAZING! This is easily the most fleshed out skill system in the series and really made me feel that every point mattered.

CONS:
1. Bosses - SO MANY IMMUNITY STAGES! Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? Almost half the bosses have ""stages"" where they sit there and charge up or whatever, and are immune to damage for sometimes up to a full minute in the middle of the battle! Very annoying and really breaks the fast paced boss fights.
2. Characters - In Borderlands 2, the characters were the absolutely best thing about the game! So many memorable people, lines, and moments. In this game there are so few that only one comes to mind while writing this review. No Mr. Torgue(Well, other than a slaughter mini-game), Lilith is a waste in this game, Mordecai/Brick are almost nonexistent, no Axton, Gaige, Krieg(Other than his voice), or Salvador, Maya is relegated to a plot point, and for some reason Hammerlock is now a whiny baby and not a fearless explorer. If you are looking for another amazing villain like Handsome Jack, prepare to be disappointed. And that leads us into point 3...
3. Ava - I don't even know what to say about this character. She is the ""Typical obnoxious teenager who never does what she's told and always does stupid things that literally get people killed but never accepts responsibility for her actions"" character and yet she STILL GETS REWARDED for being a useless dolt. Her dialogue is so bad I just started turning down my speakers every time she opened her mouth. Half her lines are yelling at characters and inanimate objects. Just an abysmal character and since she plays such an important part in the story it stands out the most out of all the poor choices for this story.
4. The Story - (I will be as vague as possible to avoid spoilers) Honestly, it's not that bad, until they seemed to abandon the plot they had been foreshadowing. The main villains are incredibly annoying, but then things start to change just before the halfway point of the game and they actually become a little interesting! There is conflict and it seemed like the story was going to take a really interesting direction, and then they abandoned it. The last third of the game is a bit of a slog but it would have been better had they gone a different route for the final boss. Overall, mediocre villains at best, and other than Promethea the planet stories were kinda boring or useless. 

Overall - I recommend this game for the gameplay and loot, which is the core of any looter-shooter, but it was really disappointing to not get another good story. By the end of Borderlands 2, I felt very attached the characters and I wanted to kill Handsome Jack so badly I stayed up late at night just to beat the game! I honestly don't even feel like I want to go back through the story again, except for Promethea. I got it on sale at 50% off, which I would definitely recommend. This is not a game I would pay full price for. It may seem like I am really ragging on the game, which is fair, but I also think it had a ton to live up to after the fantastic game that was Borderlands 2. When dialogue comes up, I role my eyes and shake my head, but the rest of the time I'm sliding, mantling, slamming, shooting, and stabbing my way through hordes of enemies, which is so much fun I forget about the bad stuff!",7 5 10 pro 1 great gameplay liked borderland 2 like game movement gun environment awesome gameplay good almost make shortcoming many seriously gunplay absolutely fantastic 2 loot gun fantastic always loved finding new gun shield relic etc 3 boss really liked bos felt different interesting mechanic go along however also con get later 4 skill played game zane amount customization skill ability amazing easily fleshed skill system series really made feel every point mattered con 1 boss many immunity stage seriously thought good idea almost half boss stage sit charge whatever immune damage sometimes full minute middle battle annoying really break fast paced bos fight 2 character borderland 2 character absolutely best thing game many memorable people line moment game one come mind writing review mr torgue well slaughter mini game lilith waste game mordecai brick almost nonexistent axton gaige krieg voice salvador maya relegated plot point reason hammerlock whiny baby fearless explorer looking another amazing villain like handsome jack prepare disappointed lead u point 3 3 ava even know say character typical obnoxious teenager never told always stupid thing literally get people killed never accepts responsibility action character yet still get rewarded useless dolt dialogue bad started turning speaker every time opened mouth half line yelling character inanimate object abysmal character since play important part story stand poor choice story 4 story vague possible avoid spoiler honestly bad seemed abandon plot foreshadowing main villain incredibly annoying thing start change halfway point game actually become little interesting conflict seemed like story going take really interesting direction abandoned last third game bit slog would better gone different route final bos overall mediocre villain best promethea planet story kinda boring useless overall recommend game gameplay loot core looter shooter really disappointing get another good story end borderland 2 felt attached character wanted kill handsome jack badly stayed late night beat game honestly even feel like want go back story except promethea got sale 50 would definitely recommend game would pay full price may seem like really ragging game fair also think ton live fantastic game borderland 2 dialogue come role eye shake head rest time sliding mantling slamming shooting stabbing way horde enemy much fun forget bad stuff

[b]The Viceroy's Log:[/b]
[b]Year 1:[/b] There's good, fertile soil here. Think I'll focus on farming wheat and brewing.

[b]Year 2:[/b] Well, no Brewery blueprints in my future it seems. Perhaps I'll luck into one in the Glades.

[b]Year 3:[/b] Forest spirits can really hold a grudge. Look, I know my direct ancestor buried your family in carnivorous termite mounds to be slowly devoured, but that's no reason to haunt my future alehouse!

[b]Year 5:[/b] Got rid of the ghost. Long story involving crowbars and very, very expired toothpaste. All set to get brewing . . . except I've got no vessel to drink from.

[b] Year 6:[/b] The good news is I've found an excellent source of leather to furnish up some waterskins. The bad news is my reptilian citizens are quite displeased with me.

[b] Year 14:[/b] The Lizard/Beaver war rages on. While I may never live down the atrocities I committed to survive, I am tormented by yet a greater agony; I've forgotten why I did all this in the first place.

[h2] I Recommend This Game To: [/h2]
- Anyone who remembers Bluebyte before the Ubisoft takeover.
- Fans of survival games that offer multiple solutions to one problem.
- Fans of Civilization games who abandon their saves before turn 50.
- Anyone who loved Age of Empires until the combat started.

[h2] You Might Also Enjoy [/h2]
- [b] Don't Starve:[/b] There are several weird survival puzzle games out there, but this one is quintessential. It boasts a fetching art style, alien flora and fauna and the best 'W' naming scheme in gaming.

- [b] Frostpunk:[/b] A chillingly directed experience compared to this game's stormy narrative. I wouldn't give Against the Storm the cold shoulder for it, but if you've weathered enough random rogue likes in gaming, icy you picking Frostpunk over AtS. I can keep going. I've got pages of these.

- [b] Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies:[/b] Maybe you like the weird but not so much the number crunching? Check out either of these titles for some, at times impenetrable, but never trite, Lovecraftian lore.

I've created utopia personified, grand architectures of the combined might of thousands.
I've wiped out the galaxy, ended untold trillions of lives.
I've burned, cracked, erased, pacified and converted entire worlds.
I've uncovered ancient mysteries and dead civilisations.
I've fostered friendships and alliances, federations that dominated the galaxy through cooperation.
I've been destroyed by the hubris of resisting a steel tide, been devoured by eldritch swarms and absorbed by ancient extradimensionals. 
I've seen stars collapse under the weight of a shared ambition and ideal, and watched as the heavens are torn asunder by the gods themselves.
I've put my iron boot to the neck of all xenos scum, and made them sing praises to a corpse throne.
I've sung the tones of the damned, and collected all lifeforms to ascend into my image, and my image alone.
I've done unspeakable things in the name of profit.
I've reshaped the galaxy through unseen and deft diplomatic hands, enstated myself emperor and made all bow to my will.
I've reshaped nations, empires and fought blood drenched civil war against myself.

I have been a learned scholar.
I have been a fervent zealot of the shroud.
I have been a champion of the people, and of freedom.
I have been the god emperor, the one above all, the autocrat and philosopher king.
I have been the oppressor and the puritan, the blood court and the exterminator.
I have been the diplomat, and the seeker of the spurned, the creator of alliances.
I have been the crusader, the unending tide of war and the admiral of an eternal fleet.
I have been the timorous oak, the defender and developer of utopia.
I have been the confluence of thousands of minds and voices, a devourer of worlds, a parasite or a simple mind.
I have been the metal horde, speaking in a chorus of binary tones and logic- an exterminator of flesh, a curator of the lesser, and a twisted all encompassing matrix.

I have seen the end, and i laughed for it held my image, and the reflections of thousands of iterations before this one.

1599340,Lost Ark,"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:

+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.

+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).

+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).

What does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?

+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.

To the actual topic:

+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).

+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character

+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character

+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'

Now there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.

TLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).

1623730,Palworld,"If you're fine with the kind of jank that games like ARK have, you'll like this. 

Palworld functions like a more fleshed out version of ark, but with pokemon. There's of course less content, but the content there is is significantly more polished than the mess that ark is. 

The game's quite good at teaching you how to start, as it has a non-intrusive tutorial on the screen for quite some time. Helps that the pals are so well designed too. Even if they look like knock off pokemon lol

The game could do with some polish, as all new games do (better binding support, bug fixes, etc) but it's not particularly noticeable. Price is also a bit outlandish, but by the time the game's done, It'll be worth it. They should definitely lower it for now, though

From looking through the negative comments, I see some people are suffering from performance issues. It's unlikely for most to have a problem, but if the game does struggle, simply lower the graphics settings. They did a great job on designing them, so it should fix the problems. Some people also don't like the genre, and are complaining in the reviews... actually wild 

Overall, if you like the genre the game's in (MMO survival + creature battler) you'll probably like Palworld. Overall, I reccomend heavily.",fine kind jank game like ark like palworld function like fleshed version ark pokemon course le content content significantly polished mess ark game quite good teaching start non intrusive tutorial screen quite time help pal well designed even look like knock pokemon lol game could polish new game better binding support bug fix etc particularly noticeable price also bit outlandish time game done worth definitely lower though looking negative comment see people suffering performance issue unlikely problem game struggle simply lower graphic setting great job designing fix problem people also like genre complaining review actually wild overall like genre game mmo survival creature battler probably like palworld overall reccomend heavily

552990,World of Warships,"So I went through the effort of downloading and launching this game for 5 minutes just to write this review. So if you are new to the game and genuinely wanting an honest opinion on it, please read my words carefully.

I've been playing this game for a little over a year now on Wargaming's client. 
I have over 2000 battles and 4 tier 10 ships grinded out as well. And am well on my way to more. 

Alright I'll get down to what everyone seems to be clamoring about and try to give an overview on it from the perspective of someone familiar with the system.

Free to Play.

All the skill needed in the game comes from a willingness to learn and the time invested in improving your skill. 
There are players I know personally who are quite good if not better than average without spending a dime. 
Most of the money that gets whaled on the game is spent by naval enthusiasts who just want to collect another historical ship. 

So how does this ingame F2p economy work?
Game progression works where each ingame nation has several tech tree lines to progress through in various classes of ships. Each line is divided into 10 tiers which determine the matchmaking the ship gets as well as it's overall power relative to other ships. 

Each battle you play you will earn credits and exp. The amounts are infulenced by things such as winning or losing. Surviving a battle. As well as individual performance. 
If you do nothing you will earn nothing.
In terms of exp grinding you are about halfway to a tier 10 ship in amount of exp grinded once you own a fully upgraded tier 8 ship.

What can you do with real money?
Well the obvious and most dramatic thing you can do is buy a premium ship. This is something I do not reccommend a new player do for many reasons.
YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Im serious. No new player posesses the skill necessary to pull their weight in a high tier premium ship. You may get away with it with the gimmicky tier 3 and 4 premiums but this is not worth it, since the main perks of premium ships is increased credit and exp income, which at low tiers is moot as you make profit easily.
PLEASE do not buy any premium ships of a tier you have never played before. 
You not only will be disappointed at your results and regret your purchase, but you can and will throw a game if you are high enough tier and do not pull your weight.

The next thing you can buy is doubloons. This premium currency allows you to do multiple things. First it lets you convert exp earned on ships you have grinded past and allows this exp to be spend on other tech trees. Note: you still need to have played the game and have a substantial amount of exp saved in these ships. YOU CANNOT GENERATE EXP OUT OF THIN AIR WITH JUST CASH. Doubloons can also be directly converted into credits. But remember credits are useless without earning exp. Finally doubloons can be used to respec skill points put into your ship's commander, demount a placed upgrade for use in another ship without spending credits and to retrain your commander instantly when placed on a new ship. 

None of these actions are impossible for a ftp player it just takes time or costs an amout of credits. For example if you have a maxed out commander. You can use the excess exp as if it was already converted by doubloons.

RNG elements.
 
Dispersion as your shells leave the barrel is determined by an RNG mechanic. This mechanic is listed in port and the lower the number, the better. The number is basically saying that at your maximum range shells fired have a chance to land anywhere in an oval shaped area with a length of that many meters.
This really isn't that big of a deal at all, unless you are playing low tiered battleships that have ass dispersion by design. 
Real life balistics on this scale of artillery were not laser accurate. They could put a shell where they wanted, mind you, but by no means were they as accurate as tanks or sniper rifles. Simply put, If you know how to aim and are skilled in leading and prediction, you can and will have a few shells hit your target per long range salvo. Medium to ideal engagement ranges, you will see most of your shells hitting. Which is pretty realistic if you ask me.

As for armor and damage, That system is less realistic, but it is more consistent. 
Shells will do the same things under the same circumstances depending on where they hit the ship. 
If armor is too thick and and/or the shell isn't large enough, It will shatter and deal no damage. 
If the shell impacts a certain thickness of armor at an angle, and the shell isn't past a certain size, it will bounce and deal no damage.
If a shell is too large and the armor of a ship is too thin, the shell will over penetrate and not have a chance to detonate it's warhead inside the target for it's regular amount of damage.
Note: The above only applies fully to AP shells, HE shells have their own mechanics, but are even more consistent.
The chance for an HE shell to set fire is also a random % chance as well. But most ships that need to set fires have incredible rates of fire and large shell volume so this isn't too terrible.
Knowing your targets and how your shells interact with them is key to dealing damage. Otherwise you are wasting ordinance on something that isn't effective.

MOBA Elements. 

This game is a MOBA through and through. 
You are on teams, Placed in an enclosed map with key areas that you need to take. 
There is a 2 point capture the flag mode, 
a 3 or 4 point domination mode, 
and ""epicenter"" where you have a large set of cap zones inside one another. Where the deepist zone is worth the most points.

Because it is a MOBA, it is not a sailing simulator. You can and will encounter players at every tier that are playing to win and maintain their stats. Just like any online game, expect some toxic ingame chats if people have slighted each other. It can largely be ignored.

I must stress PLEASE do not go into battle and ruin another players experience by not contributing, refusing teamwork, Teamkilling/damage etc. 

Conclusion

From my experience this game is not near as ruined by being f2p as other games. 
Trust me I've played a few of those. 
Where literally every ingame action has a purchase option. 
Where if your pockets are deep enough, all content is available to you instantly. 
Where power creep runs rampant every month with new mechanics and items.
After having dealt with the worst of the worst of f2p games, this game is absolutely nothing to worry about. 
Yes things will take some extra time and effort than if you invest money in the game, but paying players and free players all have to still grind a significant amount. And no amount of premium ships or economic grinding bonuses will make someone a skilled player.

I reccommend this game if you want/interested in
-Naval history and ships.
-A competitive online MOBA played at a slower pace than most.
-A free to play system that isn't pay to win.
-An absolutley massive learning curve.
-Are a fan of naval anime such as Kancolle, Arpeggio, or Haifuri. As there have been collabs in the past and some interesting weeb skins and mods available.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"I played DBD about 1030 hours. But one day, my account was initialized with an error message. All the killers and survivors's level became Level 1. And all items and perks are disappeared. I submitted a ticket to the DBD team about this matter with Steam ID64, Cloud ID, Leaderboard records, evidence photos. But they refused to compensate me, saying they couldn't find anything strange in their logs. Rather, they said that if you keep providing false information, you'll be punished strongly. Then, they closed the agenda obstinately. I really loved this game, but now I feel betrayed. I would never recommend it. There are so many bugs in this game and no compensation for the victim. Even the crew doesn't have basic manners. Don't buy this game. Don't waste your money and life.

1151340,Fallout 76,"To start with I'm a huge Fallout fan and have been from the very beginning. I've played all the games and loved them (Including questionable endings). But when Fallout 76 came out it was obvious from the beginning that Bethesda had done something very wrong so I avoided it like the plague.
Until.
A group of friends convinced me to play the new Wastelanders expansion.
So we all gave it a go. 
But one by one the all gave up on it.
Don't get me wrong it's a great game when you can actually play it. But to constantly be kicked off the servers especially in the middle of a long mission only to have to start it again and again (11 times is the record) is frustrating.
I have tried. I really have (187Hrs). 
Because I really wanted to play out all the stories this game had to tell.
But it has broken me today. I can't play for more than 5 minutes at a time and that's that.
Disappointed with Bethesda but lately there seems to be a lot of that.
It's seems to be all about the money now. Pay for a private world or pay to store more junk.

703080,Planet Zoo,"I like to call my zoo Drunk Land because most of it was made without any level of thought or planning and will probably have major consequences for everyone involved. 

The layout of my zoo is terrible and confusing, but that probably doesn't matter because the customers are too busy complaining that they can see a generator and its ruining their day. I dunno how they can see it when there's a giant pile of rocks in front of it, but I guess my guests have the power to see through rocks as long as they're not in exhibits. Also apparently free tickets are a problem, which is very realistic. Because I know if I went somewhere and they offered me something for free, what I would do is complain that free is too cheap and be concerned for the profits of a business. I definitely wouldn't be happy to get free stuff. Also, I can't make paths for crap, so all the staff paths magically float above the zoo. I like to call those the danger paths. Its a unique feature of my zoo where if an employee trips customers will get to watch him fall to his death.

I hope to one day learn this game properly, but for now I will enjoy the trainwreck that is Drunk Land and its infinite money that allows me to make all the mistakes I want and the only people that suffer are the employees, the customers, and the animals.

284160,BeamNG.drive,"I am currently a traffic crash investigator for a Sheriff's Department in the US. Not only is this ""game"" fun, it has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction. The physics engine hands down is VERY close to the real thing. Part of my job consists of taking real world crash data, reconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics. That said, not only is this game (simulator really) extremely fun, it has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes. Similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3D renderings such as this one can go for upwards of $50,000. Although Beamng.drive is not to the level of forensic software, it could be with some tweaking and insight.

I highly recommend this title and I can't wait to see what future updates hold. There are some bugs, but this isn't the full game and is to be expected.

To the developers ---- consider speaking with a consulting firm in crash reconstruction to get the correct formulas, equations, etc, and you could possibly license a professional version, which could spell big money. Some type of mode to enter real world vehicles, manipulate vehicle weights, be able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc. would be awesome. I can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballpark, very close to the real world.

1174180,Red Dead Redemption 2,"I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.

582660,Black Desert,"First thing is first, I am recommending this game but I caution you to make an informed decision with information listed below.

Black Desert Online is an MMORPG unlike its competitors, in that this MMO focuses almost entirely on PvP combat and due to this the entire combat system feels very unique.  Instead of quick-slotting abilities, BDO has a combo system where key combinations cast your abilities.  Learning your class is essential and will have many different learning curves and way of playing.  Rotating cooldown timers is an important part of it for sure, but it certainly makes the combat in this game feel better than other MMO titles.  For this reason I would say one of the main reasons I would pick this title over others is the combat.

Progression in this game is probably the most frustrating part of playing, and puts many people off.  Enhancing gear has a percentage chance to fail, which gets larger as the gear gets better.  If you fail an enhancement, the max durability of an item goes down and the only way to repair it is to get a base durability item and use it as a repair material.  This only gets more expensive when you acquire the best in slot equipment.  Additionally, once you get to the last 4 enhancement levels on a piece of gear each fail will revert the enhancement level back a step.  Players have come up with systems to increase the odds, but it is always a gamble.  Most players will choose to save their resources and buy gear rather than go through the tedious process of enhancing.  Failing higher level enhancements is extremely taxing to a player's finances.

Leveling in this game is a little quirky.  There is no hard level cap, but rather a soft cap where obtaining exp becomes so difficult that the next level is near impossible to reach.  As more players reach these higher levels the cap is raised and as such the gap between new players and old players increases.  The game managers have come up with clever events to try and close this gap and this works to varying extents.

Now let's talk about inactive progression.  This is the reason you will see so many players with thousands of hours on BDO.  This is due to inactive progression where the game will reward players for leaving their game running while they are away.  You can set the game to tab and do things such as auto-fishing.  Upon returning you can sell the fish and gain silver for time that you were sleeping, or working, whatever the case is.  Now look if you have the money for the electricity that's fine and all but not everybody does.  It is important to note that these inactive gains add up over time and can give you an edge over players who do not follow suit.

Guilds in this game are annoying.  The guild content is really nice don't get me wrong, but there is no way to trade items between players.  This isn't exclusive to guilds either.  Any items you have that you may even want to sell to your friend, you can't do so for a lower rate.  All player transactions go through an auction house, which means that there is always a chance the item gets snagged before your friends can buy from you.  I think the idea that guilds cannot share resources between members is a really dumb idea.  I understand why they do this, but it is quite a change from other MMOs.

That's a lot of meat and potatoes but here is my conclusion.  Black Desert Online has changed with time as many games do.  Back when I started playing the game in 2017 everything had a sense of wonder, and it was all uncharted territory.  Progression felt rewarding because once I was strong enough I could hold my own, or maybe even win open world PvP encounters.  This was the case for a while, but eventually the bar was raised, and winning fights was no longer an option for me.  The answer to this was grinding and pushing to have my gear enhanced but it just became a Skinner box of a video game.

Out of other MMO video games this would still be my poison of choice, but if you're looking for attainable PvE content go somewhere else.  There are very few PvE options available in the end game, but very few players reach the level at which these areas can be cleared.  This game is for those who like to PvP, and I cannot in good faith recommend this to players who want to crawl dungeons as there aren't really any dungeons to crawl.",first thing first recommending game caution make informed decision information listed black desert online mmorpg unlike competitor mmo focus almost entirely pvp combat due entire combat system feel unique instead quick slotting ability bdo combo system key combination cast ability learning class essential many different learning curve way playing rotating cooldown timer important part sure certainly make combat game feel better mmo title reason would say one main reason would pick title others combat progression game probably frustrating part playing put many people enhancing gear percentage chance fail get larger gear get better fail enhancement max durability item go way repair get base durability item use repair material get expensive acquire best slot equipment additionally get last 4 enhancement level piece gear fail revert enhancement level back step player come system increase odds always gamble player choose save resource buy gear rather go tedious process enhancing failing higher level enhancement extremely taxing player finance leveling game little quirky hard level cap rather soft cap obtaining exp becomes difficult next level near impossible reach player reach higher level cap raised gap new player old player increase game manager come clever event try close gap work varying extent let talk inactive progression reason see many player thousand hour bdo due inactive progression game reward player leaving game running away set game tab thing auto fishing upon returning sell fish gain silver time sleeping working whatever case look money electricity fine everybody important note inactive gain add time give edge player follow suit guild game annoying guild content really nice get wrong way trade item player exclusive guild either item may even want sell friend lower rate player transaction go auction house mean always chance item get snagged friend buy think idea guild share resource member really dumb idea understand quite change mmos lot meat potato conclusion black desert online changed time many game back started playing game 2017 everything sense wonder uncharted territory progression felt rewarding strong enough could hold maybe even win open world pvp encounter case eventually bar raised winning fight longer option answer grinding pushing gear enhanced became skinner box video game mmo video game would still poison choice looking attainable pve content go somewhere else pve option available end game player reach level area cleared game like pvp good faith recommend player want crawl dungeon really dungeon crawl

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.

However, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.

Other issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. 

The last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. 

To a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.

1336490,Against the Storm,"Frostpunk. Anno. Ixion. Factorio... sort of. Did you like those games?

Against the Storm is not like those games.

Against the Storm is what you get if you took the central premise of those games -- build fragile logistics chains while coping with ever-increasing external and internal pressures -- and squished it down into a 2-hour loop that demands not planning, not save-scumming, and not perfection, but improvisation. Rapid improvisation. And then, when you limp across the finish line (or collapse before you make it), it throws all your work away -- victories and failures both -- and asks you to try again.

Anno and Factorio's predictable chain of increasingly-complex logistics chains? GONE. Now you have a Lego box of random buildings, and SOME of them will do KIND of what you want! Pick one of three! There are still logistics chains, but now you only get half of them at once! What about the rest? MAKE DO.

Frostpunk and Ixion's love of punishing you for mistakes you made six hours ago? GONE. SORT OF. Now, thanks to the weather system, most of your mistakes arrive with LIGHTNING SPEED. But you can fix the problems just as fast, no perfection necessary! If you make a mess, who cares? Soon enough you'll be getting a new town anyway!

Against the Storm is a city builder without equal. Not hyperbole: as of this review, I know of no game like it.

So, if you like city builders -- or if you [i]don't[/i] -- then you owe it to yourself to give Against the Storm a try.

2198510,New Cycle,"Very promising game mixing mechanics and inspirations from Anno and Frostpunk as well as Factorio with automation later on in the game. I have been really waiting for something that combines mechanics from all those game and so far I am satisfied with the gameplay as well as progression so if you liked those three games I'd consider it a buy.

For now I still have to play trough many mechanics in the later cycles that have to do with automation and I will be updating this review however I feel like there are already few things I can mention that I see room for improvement in: 
- Queues for scouts. The longer I play the more annoying it gets to manage scouts since the events are for now very repetitive. Going forward I feel like being able to queue few destinations for scouts would improve the overall experience. Alternatively having more diverse events can help as well - for now it is just a popup about potential resources in the area and there are in total a dozen or so of them so you really quickly see them repeat.
- I would definitely improve upon policies mechanics to perhaps have them be more flashed out - some policy choices for now seem to be a choice between good outcome and bonuses and no bonuses or even a negative which makes some of them feel like an obvious choice to make.
- Decorations - obviously the game is in very early access and this feature is probably already planned as looking at the supporter bundle there are few statues that will be unlocked but if that is not the case I would love the devs to consider adding many possibilities to customize settlement with decorative buildings and perhaps even with different colour/style options for some buildings.",promising game mixing mechanic inspiration anno frostpunk well factorio automation later game really waiting something combine mechanic game far satisfied gameplay well progression liked three game consider buy still play trough many mechanic later cycle automation updating review however feel like already thing mention see room improvement queue scout longer play annoying get manage scout since event repetitive going forward feel like able queue destination scout would improve overall experience alternatively diverse event help well popup potential resource area total dozen really quickly see repeat would definitely improve upon policy mechanic perhaps flashed policy choice seem choice good outcome bonus bonus even negative make feel like obvious choice make decoration obviously game early access feature probably already planned looking supporter bundle statue unlocked case would love devs consider adding many possibility customize settlement decorative building perhaps even different colour style option building

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"It took me almost a year to finish this game because I had a really hard time enjoying it. It's not that the game is bad; it's because it's bland. To me, it feels like they were tasked with creating an RPG inspired by Harry Potter, and they had to check off all the ""standard RPG boxes,"" which they did.

The game does have some qualities, though! The castle is incredible, full of life, and very faithful to the Harry Potter universe. The first few hours were amazing as you get to explore, learn the initial spells in class, and discover the characters. Combat is also pretty decent, dynamic and fluid, which I enjoyed.

However, I quickly grew bored of this game. The main story and most side quests are poorly written (the only good one for me was Sebastian's). The acting and dialogues are also subpar.

Oh my god, I hate how they designed the equipment and inventory. Why is the inventory space so small for the HUGE amount of loot you find? Why do I have to complete Merlin challenges to expand my inventory? Why can't I have a fixed look and have to change it back each time I equip a new piece of clothing? Why do I have to unlock spell wheels with points; they should be given, etc. There are so many meaningless challenges and quests, and most of them are uninteresting.

ENDINGS SPOILERS [spoiler] They also failed miserably with the endings, seriously? They insist on the “removing emotions” part of ancient magic which is an intriguing topics, but in the end, it's like “fuck it” and decided to go with a ranrok dargon form (?). Even the Sebastian side quest ends on a very flat note. I loved his dark side and how he kills his uncle in cold blood, but then you tell him it's not the goblin that cursed his sister, and suddenly, everything is forgiven! [/spoiler]

Combat is also super repetitive because the bestiary is IMMENSELY small. Considering the vast Harry Potter lore, why do I have to fight humans, goblins, and spiders 95% of the time?

I think this game has two distinct sides:

The first one is the Harry Potter side. Yes, it's a good Harry Potter game, a great one even. If you are a fan, you will love this game because you can easily overlook all the flaws.

The second one is the RPG side. It's not a good RPG; I cannot bring myself to recommend it over other games in the same genre with the same budget.

So, because I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't recommend this game. BUT if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is the game you have been waiting for, and you should go for it. Still giving it a thumbs up because I would rate it 6/10.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","+++Update, as of Dev Blog: Into the Maelstrom (4th of August, 2023)+++ 
The long-awaited communication from the developer has clearly revealed that the game will continue it's unfortunate direction. After plentiful feedback in the past months, some major pain-points have been acknowledged, but the announced plans to address them leave much to be desired, or seem outright disrespectful to the dwindling remaining player base. 
The statements in the original review are still painfully true. While QoL is being added, the updates are few and terribly slow. Poor RNG design decisions are still predominant. New content is still not being presented and there's still no roadmap of any kind. 

My recommendation stands. Look to purchase it with a discount if interested, and treat it as an investment, for when the developers finally catch-up to it's potential some years down the line. 


+++Original Review and Recommendations+++
I've held off on a review for 6 months after release. I participated in the beta, actively engage in Discord and the forums, clocked in nearly 550 hours, got all achievements and easily play the hardest content currently available. I find the actual gameplay to be unique and personally enjoy it greatly. 

With that, I don't recommend spending money on this game in its current state. To make it neat and somewhat short: 
- The game launched in a poor technical state. While a lot of the optimization issues have been addressed there are many more still being reported on the forums. You might be one of the unlucky few. 
- The advertisements for the game amounted to little truth. What content it did launch with is repetitive and artificially bloated. New content is coming painfully slow and fails to satisfy or impress. 
- Key selling points to the Live Service model aren't being upheld. The game does get regular updates, the majority of which are fixes and balances, however. New classes haven't been spoken of since launch, a new map was released shortly after launch, with two more coming up, one of which is gated behind a community event. There have been a total of 2 new weapons in 6 months. The rest have been variants of existing items. 
- The game's design philosophy is heavily dedicated to RNG, with multiple (up to 7-8 in some cases) layers in certain game mechanics. There are extensive threads on the forums about this, if one is interested. 
- The QoL and respect for the player's time are minimal, if at all present. Mission selection is completely out of the player's hands. QoL improvements are worked on, but there's a lot left to be done. 
- Community engagement is very poor. FatShark have failed to acknowledge the majority of otherwise often fed back issues. This is in no way due to faults in the community managers, but rather a seemingly anti-consumer corporate policy. 
- No roadmap has been presented. Initial content planning was quickly reverted after the first backlashes to the game and has not been updated or even spoken of since. 
- A paid cosmetics shop was launched literally days after release and prior to any immediate patches or gameplay updates. While the cosmetics themselves are hit and miss, they do cost real money to obtain and cannot be obtained via in-game currency. There are cosmetics that can be (and more will be added with the latest Rejects Unite content release), but they are obviously re-skins and of lower quality to the premium store. 

To sum up my recommendation: Wait. 

If you have interest in 40K and horde shooters, the game has a wonderful core gameplay loop, but suffers immensely from poor design decisions, lack of content and a dwindling player base. This is historically accurate for FatShark releases, with their previous titles having similar lifespans. As it is now, the game doesn't stand up to scrutiny and doesn't deserve to be purchased at anywhere near full price, let alone further supported with cosmetics purchases.",update dev blog maelstrom 4th august 2023 long awaited communication developer clearly revealed game continue unfortunate direction plentiful feedback past month major pain point acknowledged announced plan address leave much desired seem outright disrespectful dwindling remaining player base statement original review still painfully true qol added update terribly slow poor rng design decision still predominant new content still presented still roadmap kind recommendation stand look purchase discount interested treat investment developer finally catch potential year line original review recommendation held review 6 month release participated beta actively engage discord forum clocked nearly 550 hour got achievement easily play hardest content currently available find actual gameplay unique personally enjoy greatly recommend spending money game current state make neat somewhat short game launched poor technical state lot optimization issue addressed many still reported forum might one unlucky advertisement game amounted little truth content launch repetitive artificially bloated new content coming painfully slow fails satisfy impress key selling point live service model upheld game get regular update majority fix balance however new class spoken since launch new map released shortly launch two coming one gated behind community event total 2 new weapon 6 month rest variant existing item game design philosophy heavily dedicated rng multiple 7 8 case layer certain game mechanic extensive thread forum one interested qol respect player time minimal present mission selection completely player hand qol improvement worked lot left done community engagement poor fatshark failed acknowledge majority otherwise often fed back issue way due fault community manager rather seemingly anti consumer corporate policy roadmap presented initial content planning quickly reverted first backlash game updated even spoken since paid cosmetic shop launched literally day release prior immediate patch gameplay update cosmetic hit miss cost real money obtain obtained via game currency cosmetic added latest reject unite content release obviously skin lower quality premium store sum recommendation wait interest 40k horde shooter game wonderful core gameplay loop suffers immensely poor design decision lack content dwindling player base historically accurate fatshark release previous title similar lifespan game stand scrutiny deserve purchased anywhere near full price let alone supported cosmetic purchase

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I have over 10,000 hours playing this prior to it being released on Steam. I've played it on and off for the past 10 years. It's unfortunate that it's only just now being released on Steam after all this time as I don't know how much more I will continue to play it. I loved it, but at some point I don't know if I could put in another 10,000 hours. (It still gets updates and new content)

However, for anyone new to the game, there is a massive ton of content to explore, and don't be turned off by it being an MMO. For players who prefer a single player experience there is still 100's of hours of quality content that can be done alone, friends optional.

There are 8 main classes to pick from and each one has many hours of single player story content. You'll be able to progress through all main class story lines either with just your NPC companion or bring along friends instead, or a mix of friends and companions. PVP is optional and completely avoidable.

All missions and story content are fully voiced. Voice acting, sound effects and music are movie quality and fit easily into the Star Wars universe. This is quite possibly the game with both the most quality and quantity of voice acting ever created. A huge portion of the games $200+ million dollar budget was spent on voice acting and music production and it shows.

Graphically this was among the best looking games of 2011. Visually it is not quite as sharp and polished as some current AAA games now in 2020, but it's still really good looking with the options turned up, and it's fairly low on system requirements so even people with older systems can get it running.

Each of the 8 class storylines is a unique chain of events revolving around the larger story and  give extensive replay value to experience it in new ways. Digging further there's also male/female romance story arcs and light/dark personality choices to give additional variables to your experience. I've personally played through more than 16 times to experience every variation and all the different romance, light/dark and so on variables.

And if you are into housing there's an extensive choice ranging from apartments to mansions to decorate and if you are rich you can own them all. Get far enough along and your guilds can decorate their own flag ships. (I personally owned entire flag ships outright, fully decorated at the cost of billions in game and years of effort with dozens of friends to unlock.)

The depth of both the single player and the group content is some of the most extensive available in any MMO of the past two decades.

There's really not much else to say, the game is Free to Play so you can go ahead and at least try it for yourself. There is an optional monthly subscription and it will greatly enhance your fun and is needed to unlock some end game (post class story) content, but you do not need it to start with and can easily see for yourself if you are willing to invest more into the game.

Note there are also optional micro-transactions through the Hutt Cartel, but this is purely cosmetics. There is no pay-to-win and it can be completely avoided. Most cosmetics from the Hutt Cartel can also be purchased from other players through the market for in-game credits.

If you have any interest in Star Wars, give it a try.

552990,World of Warships,"To all the players of World of Warships,

I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for anniversary celebration,plot battle,random battle,special modes,dockyard,battle pass,sequential bundles or armory. Wargaming is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game ""War Thunder,"" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Wargaming should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Wargaming keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent eighth anniversary is not just a simple anniversary, Wargaming is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.

I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Wargaming has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Wargaming continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Wargaming's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Wargaming.

I hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors, let's fight for our future. Stay strong!

There are ""world events"" that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleets, skeleton forts, fire tornadoes that spawn in ""boss"" enemies and the infamous ""Flameheart"" and his ghost fleet.

I find the game has a good balance of PvE and PvP, so you are able to attack player ships and vice versa. Plus, during your voyages surprise attacks from megladons, krakens and even a skeleton ship can attack. This game keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I highly recommend it!

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","Firstly, this game is exactly what you'd expect putting Owlcat on a WH40k setting. Including Owlcat games tending to being buggy on release but this release appears to be far less buggy than the releases of either Kingmaker or Wrath of the Righteous. Many have reported game breaking bugs in the late game but I am unsure as to why anyone would want to rush through to that point anyway - especially those who have had experience with the early release of their previous games.

Rogue Trader uses the same kind of rule system as the Pathfinder games in all but name, even the fonts used for skill selection are the same,  yet somehow it all seems a little more fluid. So aside from Warhammer specific skill-sets combat is pretty much the same turn based fare you get with the previous games.
The introduction of placing you on a moving base in the form of a huge voidship is pretty cool albeit illusory in terms of not ACTUALLY working much differently to moving from area to area quest hub to quest hub.

What is most important here is that Owlcat have outdone themselves in presenting a 40k universe full of lore that fits the cannon and just WORKS whilst remaining completely fresh in terms of narrative.
If I finish by saying that I'm having more fun with this than with Baldurs Gate 3 then that should give you some idea of how good it is. It may not be as good technically or graphically speaking but I'm personally finding it more FUN.

2140330,Madden NFL 24,"For years I was an every year, 1000s of hours, release day buyer for Madden. Madden 18 was so bad that I vowed to take a break for years to let them sort some shit out. Surely waiting 6 years would make M24 feel like an actual upgrade right? Nope, same old shit. For reference I am a franchise only player so IDGAF about MUT or anything else, my review is ""offline"" (it's actually forced online) franchise centric, considering this is supposed to be the official simulation experience of the NFL.

-Players feel sluggish, and just making them do what you want them to do is a struggle. Making these players do things they could do in real life is the whole point of a football game, but it still feels like running in quicksand. 

-Aggressive catch was useless in M18 and before, it's still useless. Same goes for possession WRs. Madden somewhere along the line decided that it should simply be impossible to complete a pass in traffic unless you're in MUT using Moss. An elite 95+ spec and CIT receiver 1 on 1 with a corner 6 inches shorter in real life is an auto throw and very likely a huge completion. In madden, it is either just dropped inexplicably, picked, or popped up in the air. There just isn't really an animation for catching a pass over a defender. It's utterly bizarre that this has gone unaddressed for a half a decade+. A very common type of receiver and play is simply not viable even 10% of the time in madden. I play with the Colts mostly, and Michael Pittman Jr. isn't Tyreek Hill, but he should be able to separate and make tough catches. But in madden there's simply no value in receivers who win via anything but speed and he isn't any fun to use. Make it make sense.

-these are NFL players, but sometimes it feels like I can't get them to do something I would be able to as a regular person because controls are so sluggish and unpolished. It isn't fun to control these guys, which is a pretty major part of a sports game.

-trench play still doesn't feel realistic. I have Quenton Nelson on my team but he doesn't feel powerful or smart at all.

-it's still very noticeable that the AI has very different rules for itself vs you, which is a terrible piece of game design. The beauty of the NFL is how coldly equal it is for everyone, and you don't get that from madden. Balls my players can reach they'll inexplicably short arm, while the CPU makes plays you know your players never would. 

-The commentators are still the worst in sports games. Delayed and nonsensical reactions. Massive moments don't feel like it, whereas they'll treat a missed preseason FG like it lost the super bowl. Madden should have multiple teams of commentators to keep it fresh, and have much more grandiose of a scope of lines recorded to pull from. If they were innovative I'd say they should start to look into use of AI to help make realistic real time reactions to stuff, I think the possibilities there are so exciting, but we all know EA doesn't innovate.

-still animation based gameplay

Now the thing I am even more qualified to comment on is the inner workings of franchise and team building. OOTP is the gold standard for this and I'll reference it a bunch because of that, but every sports franchise blows madden out of the water here. And again, disappointingly little progress has been made here, sometimes it is worse. 

-AI still feels less alive than any other sports video game. No game is perfect at immersion, but madden is truly bottom tier still. No adjustments are ever made by the CPU. Baffling team building logic. OOTP transports me to a new world, madden makes it painfully clear at all stops that it is a soulless video game made by a company that wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. 

-Bugs everywhere, and the menu is sooo slow. I'm running a 3070/5800x build and the gameplay runs fine fps wise, but the menus still are like pulling teeth. I have heard people with worse computers not even being able to open the game.

-Compounding slow menus, the UI is somehow worse than when I quit madden half a decade back. 

-Scouting, also somehow worse. You literally have to fire your whole scouting department and rehire a new one every preseason to scout effectively. If madden doesn't care to make scouting realistic or fun (this iteration of scouting is neither) then why make it part of the game at all? OOTP doesn't have a scouting mechanic- you hire a scout, with money that you could have used elsewhere, and then you simply have to put trust into that scout that their evaluations are better than other teams' scouts. If you skimped on paying for a great scout you'll have consequences, but paying for the best scout means less money for players, developments, etc. It is different, but 100X more immersive and realistic than madden. I love scouting if done right, but if you don't care to do it right, you end up with a process that just feels painful as it does in M24 and would be better off without it entirely.

-I heard some say madden's created draft classes are improved, but I don't really see it. It's still a shell of what it could be, and still isn't realistic at all. I don't see varied enough skillsets, I still see far too many bad athletes, I see unrealistic skillsets, the terrible scouting system. I did enjoy that scouting grades aren't so specific anymore-""day 3"" as a designation rather than ""round 5"" leaves it open to that player going anywhere from round 3 to undrafted, so if you like a guy you gotta take him. More realistic than before at least.

-not franchise specific per se, but one of my biggest sticking points that I honestly cannot believe has still not been addressed- positional designations. Mind mindbogglingly, draft prospects are *still* shoehorned into being ""LG"" or ""ROLB"" or ""FS,"" when in real life guys are seen much more generally as an OT prospect, an off ball LB prospect, a pass rusher, etc. It makes absolutely no sense, all it does is needlessly complicate things. How has this still not been made more realistic? Get rid of the left vs right BS, that is not how any draft analyst actually looks at prospects, and all it does it add multiple extra menus to scouting that are needless. Especially when madden lets you edit any offensive lineman to any other position with no penalty- another thing they should address.

-Not only do they still bizarrely specify things like left vs right guard, they use positional names out of 2001. LE/RE/DT/OLB/MLB for every team and scheme still? No edge rusher designation? Absolutely embarrassing for everyone involved with this game that this has not been updated in 20 years. Players on defense should be listed as such- interior defenders, pass rushers, off ball linebackers, safeties, corners, with variations within- tweener iDL-edge players, LB/S hybrids, etc. This has been how it works for a long time now IRL, and updating it would simplify it so much! Instead, we *still* have 4-3 teams signing pass rushers with 40 coverage to play off ball, or 3-4 teams with 240 pound 3techs. It hurts my brain how little effort and knowledge it would take for madden to make this change, and what a difference it would make in the quality of their product, and they still haven't. Shameful. 


I could go on, but what's the point? Whoever is making decisions for this franchise decided long ago that integrity or pride was much less important than the bottom line, so they'll keep putting out $70 roster updates designed to take money from small children via MUT. If the NFL understood the importance of a good official video game for a sport, they'd have some standards for EA, but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. TL;DR- buggy, boring, soulless, don't buy. I'll get my hours in, if only to get my money's worth and see if I can get a workable experience to last me another half decade before I give this company money again.

All the negative reviews had me quite concerned about whether I should buy the game.  However, I'm glad I did and the game deserves a lot of credit.  It does almost everything right.  I was able to play local co-op with my daughter with no issues.  The gameplay is smooth, fun, sound and graphics are quite good and so far I've been very impressed with map variety.  AI is at least as good as Gang Beasts.  I'm glad I decided to buy, and for me the lack of offline play and the microtransactions are non issues and it does not effect my experience.  I don't plan on paying for microtransactions (unless they release a frog, then I might drop some cash).  I've only played custom games with local co-op and have had no issues with lag.

703080,Planet Zoo,"My review of this game is a little hot and cold. If you are looking for an incredibly detailed and involved zoo sim then this is the game for you. 
I really wanted to love this game, but honestly don't play it very often. I was looking for something Zoo Tycoon 2-esque. But this game is next level in terms of how complicated and involved it is. There are so many things to keep track of and manage while playing. I am usually a person who loves being able to deep dive, but I find this game to be a bit overwhelming and not as relaxing or easy to fall into as I would like. 
I find some of the things you have to worry about (like keeping staff buildings totally out of sight of guests) to be fussy, and I wish there was a way to choose to have the game be less complicated. 
There also isn't really a tutorial, and the controls are fairly complicated to get used to. This is further compounded when you stop playing for awhile and then want to start back up . I feel like I am a total noob having to learn all over. On top of that there are some glitches that are incredibly frustrating. I also wish the base game came with more animals/content. 

I think if you are looking for a very involved zoo sim then this game is perfect for you. But if you are like me and were looking for something more along the lines of Zoo Tycoon 2 from your childhood, this game is far more involved than that and I wouldn't recommend it.",review game little hot cold looking incredibly detailed involved zoo sim game really wanted love game honestly play often looking something zoo tycoon 2 esque game next level term complicated involved many thing keep track manage playing usually person love able deep dive find game bit overwhelming relaxing easy fall would like find thing worry like keeping staff building totally sight guest fussy wish way choose game le complicated also really tutorial control fairly complicated get used compounded stop playing awhile want start back feel like total noob learn top glitch incredibly frustrating also wish base game came animal content think looking involved zoo sim game perfect like looking something along line zoo tycoon 2 childhood game far involved recommend

Despite all that people said, I actually enjoyed the leveling, but I am kind of a grinder in every game so dont take my word for granted in that case :D I stopped playing after a couple of weeks like a lot of people because of all the bugs and exploits, especially the duping exploits gave me the rest and i quit. I didnt want to play a game, where the market was basically done.

A friend of mine started playing again and he actually managed to convince me to try the game again a week ago. And i am so surprised...positively! The servers got merged so there are tons of players on the one we ended up with automatically (we can still change if we want for free) and they are insanely active! They changed all the negatives in a very positive way i extremely like. Most importantly: You dont need to craft those dam keys to get into a dungeon! (or expedition :P) All the Storages are accessable from every town storage so no BS travelling around with goods anymore. 
If you like the game vibe when it started and the pvp, then i would HIGHLY recommend to try the game once again and maybe you will be as positively surprised as I am :)

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"Deep Rock Galactic is like if going to work was fun. You wake up, select your mission, drink your drinks, embark, mine, shoot bugs, say something racist about elves, and unquestioning sell your labor to your underpaying, underequipping capitalist overlords. Rock and stone, do it again and again and again. What I've heard negative reviews describe as a ""repetitive grind"" personally felt like a satisfactory climb to me. I had well over 1,000 hours before things felt repetitive to me. There's simply far too many biomes, mission types, and loadouts for that to happen right off the bat. There was always something new to try out, some new achievement to get, or some challenge to overcome. 

The gameplay loop is simple. In the Space Rig, you select your class and loadout, decide if you want Today's Special (a single mission buff), and select one of eight randomly generated mission types with varying difficulty modifiers from ten different biomes, though around half the biomes will be unselectable. The missions, Today's Special, and available biomes rotates every 30 minutes. You enter the Drop Pod when you're ready, and the mission starts. You'll have two objectives: A primary objective that's dependent on the mission type, and an optional secondary objective for bonus rewards. A Mining Expedition will require you to mine and deposit a given amount of Morkite, an On-Site Refinery will require you to find Liquid Morkite wells and build pumpjacks and pipelines, etc. The secondary will always be a simple ""Collect X amount of Collectible"". This is the deal breaker for some: Every mission type will have a lot of mining in the dark. It's never going to be in total darkness, but while some mission types will require more mining than others, there's always just going to be a lot of [i]bonk plink bonk plink bonk plink[/i]. You'll be mining the primary and/or secondary objective material. You'll be mining Nitra so you can call down Resupply Pods to replenish your limited health and ammo. You'll be mining Gold for extra credits. You'll be mining crafting minerals to buy new weapons, upgrades, and cosmetics. The downtime of mining/objective completion is interspersed with fighting off alien hordes.

The class design is atypical for a class-based shooter. Instead of a DPS/Tank/Healer trifecta, you have a sliding scale of power to mobility, with Gunner being slow but strong, Scout being quick but weak, and Driller and Engineer being in-between, but everyone possessing support tools the other classes need. There's enough broad overlap that one class can pick up the other's slack, but not so much that someone's useless. Cooperation is very seamless. Resources and payouts are shared, there's no down limit, and the Laser Pointer is an ingenious diegetic ping system. This design makes playing solo feel very barebones, but it's forgivable when random lobbies are great.

The enemy design is also very unique. Rather than plainly charge forward, the Glyphids will act like actual bugs, crawling on the walls, ceilings, forming pincer maneuvers, and demanding full 360° awareness. The audio and visual design is also satisfying and well-made. Popping open Mactera, exploding a group of Grunts, it looks and feels great (though the game doesn't run too great). Nearly all enemies are heard before they are seen, but the captions only describe dialogue, so this game is a pass for deaf/hard-of-hearing players. The combat can also feel very swingy, especially with random boss encounters like the Prospector. It's the kind of game where a lot can go wrong at once and it can feel very unfair.

The randomness is one of DRG's greatest strengths and weaknesses. You can have small rooms connected by simple tunnels. You can have massive, sprawling caverns that take ages to move across. You can have open fields with massive helix structures. You can have all kinds of crazy pits, pillars, stalactites, ledges, and every single mission will be a completely new place. You can have 3 random boss encounters on the same mission. You can attempt a specific mission, lose, attempt it again, and have a completely new set of terrain and enemies. It's a never-ending brain teaser, trying to identify and react to every new situation, like a jigsaw puzzle that tears you to shreds when you mess up. Combine that with 4 radically different classes, 24 different weapons, 12-14 different modifications per weapon, and 148 Weapon Overclocks, and you get what feels like a bottomless concoction of content. 

That is, if Overclocks were easily accessible. Weapon Overclocks are additional upgrades to your weapon. Cosmetic Overclocks are special (read: We slightly changed this beard 20 times) cosmetics. You get 7.2 Weapon Overclocks a week. [i]A real life week, not a week's worth of playtime.[/i] 148/7.2 = [b]Over 4 real life months of waiting to obtain every Weapon Overclock.[/b] [i]And the Cosmetic ones take even longer.[/i] And you're given Overclocks at [i]complete random, no choice at all.[/i] I've played gachas less stingy than DRG. Many Weapon Overclocks are inconsequential stat increases, or simply shuffle around damage and ammo (+damage -ammo, +ammo -damage) and aren't very interesting. The truly dynamic and fun ones are few and far between, and you're most likely going to be trudged with countless boring ones before you get something you truly enjoy. Many fans will defend this design as ""giving you a reason to come back"" and ""encouraging you to try new things"", but the fact is, just like every other game with lootboxes, it's just a lazy way to keep player retention that hurts the game. And people will praise the battle pass for returning items to normal loot pools after it's over, but the truth is, if you miss something and it's turned into a Cosmetic Overclock, you're probably not going to see it for hundreds, if not thousands of hours. And with the new ""Season"" model for content updates, and the absolute joke of their ""fix"" for Overclocks in Season 02, expect this to only get worse as this game gets older and more content is trudged onto the pile.

Which brings me to my next point: The Deep Rock Galactic community, outside of the game, is a very unique kind of incredibly toxic. In-game? Players are co-operative, competent, and probably the best experience you'll ever get teaming up with random players in any game. In any forums though, you're greeted with total hugboxes. Any criticism of the game is met with fantasy slurs from legions of dedicated developer yesmen and non-defenses such as ""The updates are free"" and ""Still better than [AAA game]."" If you buy this game, for the love of God, do not interact with the outside community.

The game is perpetually riddled with Heisenbugs. Skyrim levels of jank. The developers straight up don't believe in standardized code. You'll be randomly launched around. Certain weapons or enemies will deal way too much or too little damage for no real reason. There are many client-exclusive bugs that don't occur to the host. And don't even get me started on [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l7TSN99lW4LpHSArf5wyw1zAHQV4TUtdgHwWhzsj1p8/edit]enemy armor.[/url] When I first got into the game, I was submitting bug reports [i]daily[/i].  

And as a mod developer, the modding system is the most unfriendly of any game's I've dealt with. Hard mod limit of 50. Every single mod will forcibly uninstall and reinstall if there's a crash. Achievements are turned off for non-client side mods. If you're deemed ""messing with intended progression"", your mod is Sandboxed; relegated to a separate save file, and never going to see the light of day. Never have I seen ""official integration"" of something be so restrictive and clunky.

Deep Rock Galactic is a game I love dearly, but I recommend it with caution. It's genuinely one of the best co-op experiences, but it's something you have to [i]really[/i] like to like it, lest you're pushed away by the live service design and gamebreaking bugs.",deep rock

Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it.

If you're reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up.

I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess. 

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.

1062090,Timberborn,"It's difficult not to draw parallels to Banished when reviewing Timberborn. It is clear that the developers have taken significant inspiration from the older game: everything from game mechanics to the difficulty curve are nearly identical. The way both games have you balancing your resources are very similar, having to prioritize between the basic needs of your people and the gathering and replanting of resources so your community can expand. Timberborn does add one additional layer to the gameplay with mechanics centered around the river: stray more than a few blocks from its borders and the land turns arid and dead, unable to support the plants you need to survive. This is used as a central resource in Timberborn: use up all the green area for plants and you won't have anywhere to place your water wheels to extract power from the flowing water. Fail to prepare for the dry season and your society will collapse as the river, and the land around it, dries up. Where Banished had you stocking up for the winter, Timberborn has you stocking up and building dams to buy precious days of fertile land into the dry season.

Timberborn differs from Banished most notably in its promise: the development of Banished tragically stopped before it could truly flourish into the perfect game. Timberborn, having been just released into early access is already almost as polished and complete as Banished was near its end. While it only took me around 6 hours to explore to the end of the current tech tree, the base game and the underlying mechanics are incredibly solid and bug free for being so early in the development, and the content that is here is already well worth the price. I am excited to see where the devs take Timberborn; give it time and it will become an incredible colony sim.",difficult draw parallel banished reviewing timberborn clear developer taken significant inspiration older game everything game mechanic difficulty curve nearly identical way game balancing resource similar prioritize basic need people gathering replanting resource community expand timberborn add one additional layer gameplay mechanic centered around river stray block border land turn arid dead unable support plant need survive used central resource timberborn use green area plant anywhere place water wheel extract power flowing water fail prepare dry season society collapse river land around dry banished stocking winter timberborn stocking building dam buy precious day fertile land dry season timberborn differs banished notably promise development banished tragically stopped could truly flourish perfect game timberborn released early access already almost polished complete banished near end took around 6 hour explore end current tech tree base game underlying mechanic incredibly solid bug free early development content already well worth price excited see devs take timberborn give time become incredible colony sim

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.

I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:

The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. 

To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. 

Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.

If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.

That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.

I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.

Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.

It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.

The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.

This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.

So that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I never write reviews on steam, but I felt I had to for this game! If you love building survival games, this game is so much fun. It feels different from any other with the added villagers and management. Almost feels like a first person survival mixed with banished. Just be prepared to restart a couple times. I originally played this game on the EA game pass, but decided to buy it on steam to support the developers.

Some tips for the new players!

- Build in a dense forest.
- Build where animals constantly spawn.
- Build near a lake or large river so you can fish later in the game.
- Stay away from the roads (villagers have pathing issues when they are too close). 
- Explore early game and loot some quality starting tools from abandoned camps and barrels.

All in all this game is a lot of fun and I know I will play for 100's of more hours. I STRONGLY recommend this game.",never write review steam felt game love building survival game game much fun feel different added villager management almost feel like first person survival mixed banished prepared restart couple time originally played game ea game pas decided buy steam support developer tip new player build dense forest build animal constantly spawn build near lake large river fish later game stay away road villager pathing issue close explore early game loot quality starting tool abandoned camp barrel game lot fun know play 100 hour strongly recommend game
1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I've played the game pretty much nonstop for a week. It's a good little simulator with loads to do. I have one gripe however, the recent update removed the ability sell basic raw materials. This is the worst decision that the developers could have made. It is a simulation of medieval times, where people were not always able to get raw materials or had the skills to craft items. The selling of the materials they did have access to was a vital component to the economy and way of life of the time. Not allowing the sale of such items therefore is stupid. I like this game as a true simulation to life back then, but this decision to remove the ability to sell basic resources destroys the illusion that the developers have worked so hard to create. They need to remove the block on selling and instead make it worth the time and effort put into crafting by adjusting the value of those goods.",played game pretty much nonstop week good little simulator load one gripe however recent update removed ability sell basic raw material worst decision developer could made simulation medieval time people always able get raw material skill craft item selling material access vital component economy way life time allowing sale item therefore stupid like game true simulation life back decision remove ability sell basic resource destroys illusion developer worked hard create need remove block selling instead make worth time effort put crafting adjusting value good

3)My microphones costed twice of what the game did
4)yes you need microphones, you can still play without them (alone) or in a squad where none use them, but to feel the stress of the game, you need microphones.
5)friendly kill is not at all tolerated in this game,you can apparently punish your friend for killing you, it will add 10s to their deploy time(ones). making your friend stare at a black screen for 10 extra seconds for killing you in cold blood is justice.
6)Get ready to see a lot of crazy things, 
my fastest death time is 00:00(instant deploy die)
Got killed by artillery 4 times at the same spawn place simultaneously, (deploy die deploy die deploy die deploy die.)

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"If ever something said ""It does exactly what it says on the tin"" it's this game.

Danger. Darkness. Dwarves.

So lets cover each key point there.

1) Danger.

Me and my miner friends thought to ourselves ""Hey we've played these games a hundred times."" and jumped into a mission one difficulty level higher than standard. This turned out to be the worst decision we had ever made as our drill drop pod opened itself to a scene from Starship Troopers. 
Our scout ziplined away to the other side of the cave where he was spit on by web slinging bugs and exploded thanks to a nearby suicide bug, our driller ran to the nearest wall and drilled himself a dead end grave whilst screaming the entire time over voice chat, our gunner fired his minigun from the doorway as I (the engi) tried to get turrets up just in time to take down the Patrician bug coming up the ramp which then released gas into the entire spawn chamber on death forcing us to leave right in to a chasm where one of us went down to fall damage. 

Then the drop pod left.

This game has danger.

2) Darkness.

This game is DARK, this game is the kind of game where you see your allies have torches on their armour and say ""Hey, how do you turn the torch on?"" only to find your torch was already on and you've made the situation oh so much worse.

You can call in a Floodlight to light up big open cave areas you've dug in to, but it costs gold so you better have mined some. You can also call in a giant sentry gun, which is handy when you're suddenly told a swarm is coming. But not so handy if you want to use that gold for a floodlight.

3) Dwarves.

This game is a Dwarf game. It's as simple as that. If you dream of gold, if you dream of digging and delving, if your beard is longer than your hair then this is exactly the game you're on this page to find. Greed and Gold are king here and you'll go back into another nightmare soley because you want more credits to upgrade your gear. I've never seen a better execution of what it means to be a dwarf in a sci-fi setting.

You dig, you mine, you make money, you call the driller a whale-piper for drilling into you by mistake and you yell ""DONKEY!"" for a box on legs to come and let you drop in your hard earned gold... And then you probably die, holding as much minerals as you can, surrounded by stone. The dream.

* survival; oh yes,  food, health, temperature, shelter
* lore/gameplay;  significant effort put into crafting a unique yet familiar worl
* social gameplay;  up to 10 fellow gamers ; open, locked and public worlds


* log into any world you want to at any time with any of your characters and carry stuff between worlds
* Use a world as a home base, while hunting, gathering, fight in, in other worlds
* up to 10 friends can co-op play with you,  you can join their worlds, they yours - carry stuff between

I was hooked almost from the beginning.  Your clumsy character makes you think the game is clumsy, no, you are just a noob and need to train up.  get to work, make an axe, and then hunt down everything in sight.

You can make a world, and keep it just to live on, and even lock yourself in the center of a castle, and when you want to play the game, go into any world you want to, or make a new one, gather stuff there, complete your store there, and use your home world as a storehouse and life raft.  You can logout at any time, and what you do in one world can be carried to the next both as items, and as experience.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"I'm about 20 hours into this game, so I wanted to drop a quick First Impression:

BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.   Based on my perspective, CK3 is a more of a hybrid wargame/management system.  Like many of the CIV games, you have opportunities to build and improve provinces... and you can certainly raise military forces (I think strictly land-based; naval seems to be abstracted or nonexistent so far).  

But the builder/wargame aspect is only 50% of the game experience, and I estimate that liberally.  All of these things are tightly wrapped up in a decision-based management system that produces causes and effects; with some of the effects being far-reaching.

EXAMPLE: your head of clergy doesn't like you, so he accuses you of having an incestuous relationship.  You decide to Deny it.  He gets even madder.  One of your courtiers hears a rumor that the clergyman is plotting to kill your daughter.  So you secretly arrange for him to be murdered.  The neighboring Lord finds out through spies that you're responsible, so he blackmails you.  Even though you pay him off, his cousin, the Lord in the OTHER neighboring county decides you're weak and decides to lay claim to YOUR title... armies march, wars get fought, etc....

YES, this gets THAT complicated.  And the levels of all of these interactions get very deep and very complicated, like a spider web.

So far, I'm loving it (although to be frank, the ""new"" hasn't quite worn off yet).  The biggest advice I can give anyone thinking about buying CK3 is what I said up front:  Make Sure You Know What You're buying.

If you buy it looking for only a wargame, you'll be disappointed.  If you buy it only looking for an empire builder (like CIV), you'll be disappointed.

Respectfully submitted as my humble opinion; take it or leave it.",20 hour game wanted drop quick first impression aware getting based perspective ck3 hybrid wargame management system like many civ game opportunity build improve province certainly raise military force think strictly land based naval seems abstracted nonexistent far builder wargame aspect 50 game experience estimate liberally thing tightly wrapped decision based management system produce cause effect effect far reaching example head clergy like accuses incestuous relationship decide deny get even madder one courtier hears rumor clergyman plotting kill daughter secretly arrange murdered neighboring lord find spy responsible blackmail even though pay cousin lord neighboring county decides weak decides lay claim title army march war get fought etc yes get complicated level interaction get deep complicated like spider web far loving although frank new quite worn yet biggest advice give anyone thinking buying ck3 said front make sure know buying buy looking wargame disappointed buy looking empire builder like civ disappointed respectfully submitted humble opinion take leave

552990,World of Warships,"Try it, don't buy.

This is a game that starts simple, with a gentle learning curve and protected matchmaking for new players. It'll be fun. You'll research new ships, unlock missions, join a clan...and then you'll inevitably hit a fun wall. Try being in a match against enemy Aircraft Carriers and having virtually no counter. Try being in a match with a Tier 5 glass cannon Cruiser against veterans in Tier 7 ships that sink you with one salvo. The power difference between tiers is slight to start with, and very wide at the top tiers. And this is a game that wants you to be at the bottom of the food chain, so you'll pay to get to the top faster, or pay for a Premium ship because you think it will help you. It won't.

This is a game that is hard to master (which is good), but driven by marketing decisions and predatory practices (sunk cost fallacy, fear of missing out) that emphasises corporate greed over player enjoyment (this is bad). It was once fairly balanced, with only the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy, and no Aircraft Carriers. But then came German, British, French, Commonwealth, Pan-American, Pan-European, and of course Russian. It's a Russian company, and they swear there is no bias. They try to make all nations have different playstyles (this is good) but as more ships are added the internal balance becomes more ridiculous, so now we have French Destroyers that go over 55 knots, and European torpedoes that travel at over 90 knots!

And the Russians? Well they seem to be blessed by having the most damage resistance, the biggest guns, and fast-turning turrets. We are all waiting Russian Aircraft Carriers to be introduced to see what these apex predators look like. As a general rule, the better a ship was in real life the worse it will be in the game, because reality imposes design compromises that paper ships don't. And this is a company that claim Realism is part of the game DNA. Researchable ships are meant to represent a entire class, but Premium ships are marketed to represent their historical namesake and appeal to collectors. The models can look fantastic, but never forget that gameplay comes first and accuracy takes a back seat. Speed and gun calibre may match, but rudder shift speeds, turning circle, acceleration, turret traverse, velocity, penetration, bursting charges, torpedoes, AA, and most of all concealment are simply a fantasy. Put emotion aside: you're not buying the real ship (and when I say buy I really mean rent).

In the last year and a half the game has changed for the worse. The developers ignore all negative feedback and simply push through on changes that make the game worse. We used to have Aircraft Carriers with strategic gameplay and air supremacy counterplay; now we have a very dumbed down flight simulator for attack planes and no way to counter. We used to have 11 pve Operations rotated weekly; now we have 5, and the rewards have been nerfed. We now have a Research Bureau for an elite of players who have researched 5 ship lines all the way to Tier 10 to get extra goodies; the community protested because it locks away advantages behind a grindwall, and nobody really wanted to regrind entire lines they already spent years on. We are going to get Submarines shortly, to add a fifth matchmaking class; nobody asked for them, but it will help sell new ships so we're getting them and to hell with the gameplay experience. The developers claim that change is needed to avoid stagnation but the community are dropping out from change fatigue. It is no coincidence that the positive reviews you will read are from those with hours played in single or double digits; the negative ones from those with hundreds and thousands of hours played who are passionate about the game and extremely disappointed. But the same people driving these bad decisions are still in their jobs, and the money is flowing in, and that's all they care about. When it comes to the players the developers always choose the path of least generosity, for their virtual (i.e. worthless) stuff, but when players who pay real money for stuff feel cheated they'd rather upset everybody rather than contemplate any compensation. That's who you're dealing with, guys.

FINAL EDIT FOR 2021: I stopped playing for good on 25 December 2020 because of imminent changes that I felt would further ruin the game play experience, e.g. a complete overhaul of captain skills that promised diversity but only cemented a min-max approach for all classes and completely destroying Cruisers as a viable ship in the PVP game. World of Warships is in a very bad place right now, and that's before entirely new mechanics are introduced (Submarines and Aviation Battleships). Avoid, avoid, avoid. Uninstalled with a heavy heart because I loved the game when it was fun (2018 was a great year).",try buy game start simple gentle learning curve protected matchmaking new player fun research new ship unlock mission join clan inevitably hit fun wall try match enemy aircraft carrier virtually counter try match tier 5 glass cannon cruiser veteran tier 7 ship sink one salvo power difference tier slight start wide top tier game want bottom food chain pay get top faster pay premium ship think help game hard master good driven marketing decision predatory practice sunk cost fallacy fear missing emphasis corporate greed player enjoyment bad fairly balanced united state navy imperial japanese navy aircraft carrier came german british french commonwealth pan american pan european course russian russian company swear bias try make nation different playstyles good ship added internal balance becomes ridiculous french destroyer go 55 knot european torpedo travel 90 knot russian well seem blessed damage resistance biggest gun fast turning turret waiting russian aircraft carrier introduced see apex predator look like general rule better ship real life worse game reality imposes design compromise paper ship company claim realism part game dna researchable ship meant represent entire class premium ship marketed represent historical namesake appeal collector model look fantastic never forget gameplay come first accuracy take back seat speed gun calibre may match rudder shift speed turning circle acceleration turret traverse velocity penetration bursting charge torpedo aa concealment simply fantasy put emotion aside buying real ship say buy really mean rent last year half game changed worse developer ignore negative feedback simply push change make game worse used aircraft carrier strategic gameplay air supremacy counterplay dumbed flight simulator attack plane way counter used 11 pve operation rotated weekly 5 reward nerfed research bureau elite player researched 5 ship line way tier 10 get extra goody community protested lock away advantage behind grindwall nobody really wanted regrind entire line already spent year going get submarine shortly add fifth matchmaking class nobody asked help sell new ship getting hell gameplay experience developer claim change needed avoid stagnation community dropping change fatigue coincidence positive review read hour played single double digit negative one hundred thousand hour played passionate game extremely disappointed people driving bad decision still job money flowing care come player developer always choose path least generosity virtual e worthless stuff player pay real money stuff feel cheated rather upset everybody rather contemplate compensation dealing guy final edit 2021 stopped playing good 25 december 2020 imminent change felt would ruin game play experience e g complete overhaul captain skill promised diversity cemented min max approach class completely destroying cruiser viable ship pvp game world warship bad place right entirely new mechanic introduced submarine aviation battleship avoid avoid avoid uninstalled heavy heart loved game fun 2018 great year

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"First the good things.

-> Multiple planes/realms are going to be a game changer. The kinds of maps that will come from this have the potential to be the best ever. It's making me think of old Age of Wonders or Civ 2 Test of Time. (A more modern example is how one could 'thematically' take the ideas of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and have the game play out over a sky world, underworld, and regular surface simultaneously).
Give the community some time and we're going to get some good stuff.
-> New magic domain, very interesting and tricky. Some of the concepts (False Food in particular) I'm not sure how it would work outside of super situational issues, but it's cool as an idea. New nations are also cool, though once Dominions Enhanced gets ported to this we're going to be drowned for content once more.
-> Horse Armor! Okay, paying a lot for this one, but I like it. I am disappointed it's just barding, magical horse shoes are too cool of an idea and I super want to see that added by a mod or maybe later. But as is the changes to cavalry units in general will likely make them much more fun to play with. Plus some new tactical command options are helping as well.
-> Map generation improved, though I prefer the fun maps we're going to get soon enough. The terraform powers are going to be cool... and make me curious if there's anyway to implement that with custom maps if someone wanted to be extremely extra.
-> The new blessing/creator tweaks are very neat. Common blessing points, reducing/changing how the scales balance... it's going to take some time to wrap my head around it but it does feel like a way to make builds bit less super gimmicky while also allowing for more variety that can work. This feels like a wait and see.
-> New magic item balance is interesting... I might like it more once I play with it some.

Bad.
-> Okay, so what happened here? Did the rights expire? Why no 'Lady of the Dawn'? I've been vibing to that song for years now. The new music is okay, but I really want the old stuff back and mixed in with it.
-> Spellcasting AI feels a bit wonky at the moment. A communion killed all the other mages because they kept casting the same self-buff spell over and over and over. I do not remember this being an issue in D5 so something is up.

Anyhow, thanks once more for making one of the few games here or elsewhere that I actually feel is worth getting day one and for full price.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lost Ark Community Managers put out a July Player Survey and I started writing about why I'm not playing the game hardly since the June Patch for some poor soul at Amazon to probably never read, and figured I'd also put that at the bottom while I'm at it.

As for new people wanting to try this game: 

New players will never have the early game experience I had to push me to play as much as I did. You will skip past T1-2 and half the raids/dungeons the game has to offer that I got to learn on par with a group. Once you skip to T3 and current content you will be gatekept by the ones who want to get the raids done as quickly as possible and move on to their next character for the week.

Learning parties are far and few between, so you can try to sneak into an experienced run. But if you started now or recently, you will have to swipe to reach the newest endgame content quickly, and you'll still be missing the rng obtained card sets you need and stick out like a sore thumb because of your roster level that experienced lobbies check. There ARE lobbies that will take you anyways but expect to spend some time getting denied first. The PvP scene is pretty much nonexistent and the open world bits are unbalanced, so look elsewhere if that's what you're wanting out of this game. 

""But you have over 2k hours"" a lot of that was spent playing the game in a different state than what it currently is, with new raids and content every other month, and building new characters to that new content was relatively cheap and not as time consuming. We are almost caught up to Korea and that pacing of content release is going to slow way down while honing costs and time spent for less gain will continue to go up. 

The combat is very fun and visually the game looks great. Fleshing out your character's build and seeing it come together is very satisfying, but tripods, engravings, and skill points are one and done pretty early on.
Ultimately, your character's growth will become governed solely by honing your item level and nothing else, which doesn't give that same satisfaction as it's exponentially more time consuming and expensive for less and less gain.


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Spending about 250k gold to push my main from 1565 to 1580 after months of doing the same dailies was honestly just too disheartening. The people I play with either run 18 raids a week for gold and have a main 6 roster almost or all 1580+ OR they don't play enough and aren't able to run the new 1580 content on their main. They likely won't be there in time for Akkan either.
I work Mon-Fri, and for months, I dedicated more than half of each day off, including Friday after work to run rested chaos and rested guardians on my roster, and try to squeeze in raids during the week or after grinding dailies during the weekend. 
And to do that just to barely scrape by to reach 1580 knowing I will only be able to continue playing new content if I continue to grind even more was a realization that finally hit after spending months of materials and gold on that honing session. I enjoy the game's raids when I can, but not 6 characters a week. 
For a long while, I ran 10+ characters of chaos and guardians, and established a strong main 6 roster. Then I started to cut back and only run main 6 chaos and guardians that generated the new materials, then with new content only my 4 characters at 1540+ I would run rested daily content on. 
Despite that, I wouldn't have even had enough gold to push ONLY my main to 1580 if not for playing the fish market and holding onto that gold for months. That itself required brainless hours buying Redflesh fish and Pearls because of the Auction House changes to combat bots. That well is now dry, and I don't have it in me to build it back up, either by doing the same chaos and guardian spam every Fri-Sun or sitting there slowly buying up a small ocean of fish watching something on the side.

I will and I won't miss this game. The experience at launch and for a while after was some of the best this game had to offer. Me and all my friends learning new mechanics through tier 1 and 2 dungeons and raids, watching each other hone up, and doing content together. Who can make it to T3 first and start selling those great honor leapstones for 800 gold a pop? The 1340-1370 dead zone was the first time the brakes hit the train, some of us made new alts, some took the time to play something else after no lifing the game since release. Argos comes out and we all prog gate 1 together but then numbers started dropping from our group because of the grind. The rest of us continue on, running Argos 1-3 for weeks till Valtan. Slowly through Vykas, Clown, and Brel NM, some started playing less and for others this game became a second (or first for the students/unemployed) job. 

I grew my roster during this, through more characters to run chaos, occasional swiping, and changing from gunslinger to reaper main I had several strong characters that could run the newest content or at least the first few gates of it. The honing past 1540 is where I finally started to feel the pain of honing draining my resources. My reaper was 1520 on Brel NM release, some other alts were 1500 or working up to it. Same for Brel HM release. My reaper was 1560 and fewer alts were 1540 ready for at least gates 1-2. And yet, I never cleared or even got to attempt gates 5-6 HM because for those who this game became a second job attempted it (and they've still yet to even clear it) without me and the ones I really wanted to try it with. So the ones left behind just stopped playing pretty much because they don't wanna pug it, and understandably so. I usually ran Brel HM 1-2 on 4 characters and 3-4 on 2 of those 4. Now Kayangel is here and my only character I used up the last of my resources to reach 1580. The rest of my roster will never reach that, and realizing so I don't wanna put in the time to even try.

284160,BeamNG.drive,"This game is THE best driving simulator i know. 
why, you ask?
well first there is the soft body physics which are very similar to a real car. that means if you're rallying and you want to cut the corner and hit a rock with the suspension instead of the wheel, you will break your suspension. oh don't worry you can still finish, but you'll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions... or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run! as the youtuber Jimmy Broadbent said: in beamng compared to so many other racing games, the car actually feels like an object you have to look after.

secondly there is the sheer amount of fun stuff you can do with this game like dirt rally, tarmac rally, track racing, drifting, derby, off road, drag, or simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds. there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim. there are a lot of scenarios you can choose from, like classic dirt rallying (i really love dirt rally and it's really good in this game), police chases, cool stunts like in movies, deliveries, races (some light and breezy and some very challenging) and sooooo much more. i have played 20 hours so far and haven't even remotely scratched the surface of this game's content. 

the maps in this game are very impressive. my favorite is Italy, a highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roads, that go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test. there is Industrial site, where you can practice your drifting, rallycross/derby. there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarios. 

there is a photo mode in which i have made all of my most recent desktop backgrounds.

on top of all that there are a LOT of mods that can add to your driving experience and the devs are super supportive of them, even so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game. you can download maps, components for your cars, new cars, and so much more. i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod. you can find it in the repository under the name ks_nord it's a super realistic FREE and SCANNED map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany. most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and it's fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game. also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game. it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with people, racing and cruising.

anyway. i could go on about this but i'd rather play the game instead. see ya!",game best driving simulator know ask well first soft body physic similar real car mean rallying want cut corner hit rock suspension instead wheel break suspension oh worry still finish suffer consequence decision restart scenario try fresh car get clean run youtuber jimmy broadbent said beamng compared many racing game car actually feel like object look secondly sheer amount fun stuff game like dirt rally tarmac rally track racing drifting derby road drag simply cruising comfy road car comfy speed career mode tried little intend look nice fun challenge conventional typical racing sim lot scenario choose like classic dirt rallying really love dirt rally really good game police chase cool stunt like movie delivery race light breezy challenging sooooo much played 20 hour far even remotely scratched surface game content map game impressive favorite italy highly detailed huge map countryside italy long serpentine road go mountain seaside three city explore drive countless dirt gravel road put rallying skill test industrial site practice drifting rallycross derby east coast usa cruise highway make cool police chase scenario photo mode made recent desktop background top lot mod add driving experience devs super supportive even made accessible website game download map component car new car much recommend getting nurburgring map mod find repository name ks_nord super realistic free scanned map legendary nurburgring circuit nurburg area germany fanmade mod map game looked really good fun see loving passionate comunity racing game also look beammp multiplayer mod game constantly looked updated creator far find really fun roleplay people racing cruising anyway could go rather play game instead see ya

At first I found it (the story, gunplay, movement, animations) really slow and the missions quite same-ish, the game grows on you as it progresses, by the end of the main chapters, you are fully attached to the games characters.

It is not the best game I've played but it is a solid 9/10, the following on with the Epilogue is amazing and the credits that follow are also great too. 

Replayablity is there with being able to explore the open world, random encounters, hunting and side missions etc

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Let me make it clear - the core gameplay is really fun when the game works. Combat is meaty and visceral and it feels amazing to play with your friends.

That said... nothing in this game is finished or works right and the developers are extremely dishonest and keep lying to the community constantly.

1. The game is very unstable. Crashes plague most players. If the game isn't crashing then you're getting vague error codes disconnecting you from matches (which is frustrating because you get no reward on loss), massive load times to get back in, and issues getting your group together.

2. The balance makes literally no sense. Damage numbers are apparently chosen at random for weapons and the modifiers from perks are equally arbitrary. The same tier of traits for you to choose from will have choices like: 5% more damage every 3rd strike, 5% damage reduction, or deal double damage for 10 seconds every kill. There is only one real choice.

3. The itemization, loot, and end game are not finished. The shop randomly generates 10 weapons every hour and you have the privilege to buy them. Most of the weapons are crap and have random rolls so you just have to wait for the next hour. You get no rewards for actually playing the game, playing well, and finishing missions. The game is just this shop.

4. There is no story in the game. The developers bragged about a complex and engaging story written by author Dan Abnett... there is no story in the game. There are 5 short cutscenes introducing vendors and that's all. The developers blatantly lied to the community.

5. Crafting isn't in the game even though it was advertised - along with weapon modification. The developer lied to the community saying it would be in on launch, then right after launch, then by the end of December... even though they knew all their staff was on vacation and not working on the game. You can't  trust anything they say.

6. The cash shop is predatory and insulting. It was the only thing that worked right on launch. And they had the gall to also make the offerings limited time only... and when players complained they said ""we didn't want to confuse players with too much choice"". Lie after lie and marketing lingo/buzzwords. The cash shop skins are also poorly made and have missing fingers when worn, clipping items, or don't animate properly.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] The non-exhaustive list of scummy things Gaijin does purely for profit. [/h1]

Disclaimer: This is a list compiled by u/agysykedyke on Reddit. It aggregates and summarises the abhorrently antagonistic and hostile behaviour Gaijin has shown their community and players throughout the years. This is but a fraction of the malevolence characteristic of this company.

Addendum: My total hours played on Steam are not representative of how long I've spent in War Thunder. I've been playing this game since the beta and have played it on multiple platforms throughout the last ten years with much of it being played through Gaijin's own launcher. After having been disgusted and physically repulsed by Gaijin's treatment of their community over the last two years, I've decided that enough was enough. I have watched this game deteriorate and it is no longer the game that I once enjoyed and hoped would become a maverick of its genre. It exists only as a tragedy of what could have been.

[quote=agysykedyke] [i] In light of the new awful economy changes, I have compiled a list of all the scummy things Gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players, in the name of profit only. I really hope they change some of these things for the better. [/i]

[olist]
[*]Intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs.

[*]Intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them, in order to make people purchase them.

[*]The price of said premiums being equal to triple-A games. I don't know how it's excusable for some premiums to be $70 when they already sell premium accounts for $10 a month.

[*]Intentionally making SL modifiers low and repair costs high, so that the average player cannot break even in SL after a game. This encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle. This also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses.

[*]Implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind. Keep in mind each premium can cost up to $70.

[*]Forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy, regardless if they ever want to use it. A lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not, because Gaijin wants you to spend more SL.

[*]Forcing players to buy X vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier. This increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing.

[*]Still making the SL and RP grind painfully slow even if you are using Premium vehicles and a Premium account, especially at the top tiers. Mind you you are paying $10/month + the price of 2-3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it's still very slow.

[*]Intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as Spare Parts, FPE, NVD, usable ammo, and countermeasures. This is to make players purchase these modifications with GE.

[*]Introducing crew qualifications, which are arguably a pay-to-win feature. Aced crews provide significant advantages over basic. The SL cost for expert crews and the grind for Ace crews are not viable for the average player, people just purchase Ace crews.

[*]Putting players in debt over their own mistake after the January 2022 incident. They could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a New Year's gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down. This was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed, and Gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash.

[*]Selling pay-to-win bush cosmetics, which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for, are unavailable for half the year, and you only get one random bush.

[*]Implementing an RP soft cap, which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won't be compelled to spend money.

[*]Introducing strike drones, to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose SL. If you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less SL earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers, a net negative overall.

[*]Intentionally making one nation overpowered, then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation.

[*]Intentionally keeping the BR's compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating, to limit skillful players, and make players more likely to spend GE on mods, crews or premiums.

[*]Intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers, because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly.

[*]Making Boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of FOMO

[*]Slashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive. For example, making the players ""choose"", but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players.

[*]Introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return, or are sometimes OP, capitalizing on FOMO.

[*]Introducing lootbox-style crates bought for GE, or ridiculous amounts of SL, with very low chances of getting the reward you want. This is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"After 'completion' of the main story in HF2 and having a strong comparison to HF1 I can honestly say what improved and what needs improving for the future of this game.

What improved:

Graphics:
The game is visually pleasing, featuring detailed wood types, walls, and furniture. It runs smoothly even on high settings, with beautiful neighbourhoods and interesting architecture.

Building!
Building in HF2 is a significant improvement from HF1. It's smoother, quicker to create, and easy to undo mistakes. The addition of laying bricks and different roof types enhances the experience, allowing for realistic recreations and quick adjustments. Even if you're not a fan of building, it's worth trying for its user-friendly approach.

Sandbox mode:
A fantastic addition to HF2, fulfilling a need from HF1. The ability to build and playtest different builds is excellent. Creating custom jobs, sharing them on MOD.io, and enjoying the community's astonishing creations make the game better. It's a great way for the community to come together.

Moving doors/windows:
Controversial or not, the ability to easily adjust misplaced windows or doors in HF2 is a welcomed change. Unlike HF1, where mistakes meant buying again, this convenience makes the process less tedious, especially in larger builds.

Placing stuff/Grid snapping and Precise placing:
I love it. Aligning halogen lights flawlessly in HF2 is a breath of fresh air. It's a vast improvement from the frustrating experience in HF1.

Placing wallpapers/tiles:
Much better in HF2 – fewer resources needed, more coverage. It's simple, smooth, and easy. Only frustration comes when reaching high spots without buying scaffolding due to laziness, fykyk.

Store:
Navigating specific items in HF2 is a breeze. Unlike HF1, you don't need specific names of the furniture piece you're after. For example, nightstands and coffee tables are in the same category with sub-categories for easy access.

Customisation:
Choosing colours or patterns for sofas, chairs, or wallpapers in HF2 is fantastic! You can go all out with a zebra print house – literally nobody can stop you.

Improved cleaning:
Cleaning in HF2 takes longer, covering less area, and requiring precise targeting. Yet, it's satisfying, especially spraying and wiping. The Flipper instinct revealing all dirt ensures no stains can hide.

Other:
-HF2's wall-painting tool lets you paint specific patterns without constant fixes. You can paint pixel art on the walls if you want to.
-The Flipper tool allows easy style changes, copying, and duplication. You don't need to re-buy items, just copy and paste style on whatever it is you need.
-Wiring is a standout feature, allowing precise light control. Each light to a different switch, you can get super creative with it.
-The overall beautiful lighting and lush gardens enhance the game's aesthetics and feel.

Now, onto future improvements and additions needed for the game.

Before/After photos:
After my first house flip in HF2, the absence of a before/after feature was disappointing. While it was a DLC in HF1, for HF2, this beloved feature should be part of the base game. It's immensely satisfying to see the changes, and I hope the devs add this in a future update.

Blinds/Curtains:
Or lack of them. Surprisingly, the base game lacks a vital aspect of building/renovating. Having a few basic blinds/curtains with customisation options would be acceptable, but the overall absence is disappointing.

Doors:
The game lacks door variety, offering only a few choices. While customisation is possible, a broader selection beyond the most popular door types would be appreciated.

Exploration:
I recall a dev stream mentioning the freedom to walk around the neighbourhood, allowing us more freedom. However, in the actual game, there's a border restricting exploration, which was disappointing. This was the first thing I checked in the game. Using flight mode in Sandbox is the only way to get close to neighbour houses, walking up to the porch isn't possible.

Items:
In the early stages, limited assets are forgivable, but after completing the game in not a very long time, the lack of variety in assets became apparent. Even with style changes, builds started looking the same. The current content doesn't justify the original price of the game.

Selling houses:
Compared to HF1, HF2 feels like a downgrade in that aspect. In HF1, satisfying specific buyer needs for achievements added depth, with remarks influencing the sale. HF2 lacks this, and I expected more in-depth buyers and unique characters for selling houses.

Paintings:
The lack of pictures in HF2 is a shocker. Buying a picture frame seems pointless when houses have blank frames with no images available. Even a few stock images would be an improvement; currently, it's a significant downgrade.

Conclusion:
I'd recommend House Flipper 2 for its enjoyable story, graphics, and potential for growth. However, I believe essential additions should come through free updates, not just DLCs. Now, I never expect things for free as I know the dev team worked really hard on this game and they deserve a pay for their work, however the current price should warrant more assets and expected features from HF1. I'm excited for future DLCs, hoping for the return of pets, farming, luxury stuff, and a more immersive story. The game is fun and beautiful, but more assets and a deeper storyline are needed. 
In short, it offers a lot but also lacks in certain aspects. Kudos to the devs for their hard work on this game. We hope to see more improvement in the upcoming updates!",completion main story hf2 strong comparison hf1 honestly say improved need improving future game improved graphic game visually pleasing featuring detailed wood type wall furniture run smoothly even high setting beautiful neighbourhood interesting architecture building building hf2 significant improvement hf1 smoother quicker create easy undo mistake addition laying brick different roof type enhances experience allowing realistic recreation quick adjustment even fan building worth trying user friendly approach sandbox mode fantastic addition hf2 fulfilling need hf1 ability build playtest different build excellent creating custom job sharing mod io enjoying community astonishing creation make game better great way community come together moving door window controversial ability easily adjust misplaced window door hf2 welcomed change unlike hf1 mistake meant buying convenience make process le tedious especially larger build placing stuff grid snapping precise placing love aligning halogen light flawlessly hf2 breath fresh air vast improvement frustrating experience hf1 placing wallpaper tile much better hf2 fewer resource needed coverage simple smooth easy frustration come reaching high spot without buying scaffolding due laziness fykyk store navigating specific item hf2 breeze unlike hf1 need specific name furniture piece example nightstands coffee table category sub category easy access customisation choosing colour pattern sofa chair wallpaper hf2 fantastic go zebra print house literally nobody stop improved cleaning cleaning hf2 take longer covering le area requiring precise targeting yet satisfying especially spraying wiping flipper instinct revealing dirt ensures stain hide hf2 wall painting tool let paint specific pattern without constant fix paint pixel art wall want flipper tool allows easy style change copying duplication need buy item copy paste style whatever need wiring standout feature allowing precise light control light different switch get super creative overall beautiful lighting lush garden enhance game aesthetic feel onto future improvement addition needed game photo first house flip hf2 absence feature disappointing dlc hf1 hf2 beloved feature part base game immensely satisfying see change hope devs add future update blind curtain lack surprisingly base game lack vital aspect building renovating basic blind curtain customisation option would acceptable overall absence disappointing door game lack door variety offering choice customisation possible broader selection beyond popular door type would appreciated exploration recall dev stream mentioning freedom walk around neighbourhood allowing u freedom however actual game border restricting exploration disappointing first thing checked game using flight mode sandbox way get close neighbour house walking porch possible item early stage limited asset forgivable completing game long time lack variety asset became apparent even style change build started looking current content justify original price game selling house compared hf1 hf2 feel like downgrade aspect hf1 satisfying specific buyer need achievement added depth remark influencing sale hf2 lack expected depth buyer unique character selling house painting lack picture hf2 shocker buying picture frame seems pointless house blank frame image available even stock image would improvement currently significant downgrade conclusion recommend house flipper 2 enjoyable story graphic potential growth however believe essential addition come free update dlcs never expect thing free know dev team worked really hard game deserve pay work however current price warrant asset expected feature hf1 excited future dlcs hoping return pet farming luxury stuff immersive story game fun beautiful asset deeper storyline needed short offer lot also lack certain aspect kudos devs hard work game hope see improvement upcoming update

108600,Project Zomboid,"It's late night. On top of my exhaustion, I'm blinded by the absence of light. But I can't stop now.

I've been walking for almost an entire day - although in my current state, this feels more like an eternity. My weary footsteps echo through the desolate, darkly moonlit roads. My previous safehouse was overwhelmed by a straggling horde the day before. I ran, only with a small bugout bag I could salvage while I drowned in desperation and fear.

Finally, I stumble upon a new city, utterly fatigued, parched, and famished. Lost in the suffocating darkness, I desperately search for refuge, until my bleary eyes catch sight of a looming dark silhouette - a mansion, cloaked by the deepest shadow of the night.

Feeling the walls in the dark, I am blessed with luck. This feels like an utter disrespect to the oppressive darkness around me. I managed to grasp the doorknob on my first attempt - and it is unlocked. Fumbling blindly, I confirm that every entry point on the ground floor remains sealed shut. Denying myself of solace, fearful of prying eyes or ears, I determine that my only sanctuary lies on the mansion's upper floor.

I enter the suite, seeking shelter behind a fortress of barricaded doors and windows - the house's entrance, the bedroom's threshold, and ultimately, the final barrier of the bathroom door. Within those confines, I hope for the slightest reminiscence of peace, a fleeting moment of respite from the encroaching chaos outside. I pray that all these barriers that confine me within are enough for me to wake up from my slumber and muster the remaining of my dwindling vigor, in the chance that my new sanctuary is breached by the looming.

With every ounce of strength left in my battered, punished body, I hasten towards my coveted sanctuary, yearning for a sip of the last water drops from the city water supply and eating the remains of my canned dog food.

As I push open the bathroom door, the last portal to my salvation, fate unveils its malevolent mockery against me. I am not the only one who sought refuge within these walls. Another soul had the same idea before, sealing both our fates. Long ago, someone met their demise in this very room. Now, their lifeless corpse stands motionless, a grim sentinel guarding this bathroom. A puppet of chance, devoid of purpose, waiting for an unsuspecting prey - a perfectly set trap, just like a mousetrap anticipates its unwitting mouse.

I swing the door open, a gateway to either salvation or damnation. But in my exhausted state, my famished and sleepless body is unable to react swiftly enough. The reanimated corpse lunges at me, its rotten fangs sinking deep into my jugular.",late night top exhaustion blinded absence light stop walking almost entire day although current state feel like eternity weary footstep echo desolate darkly moonlit road previous safehouse overwhelmed straggling horde day ran small bugout bag could salvage drowned desperation fear finally stumble upon new city utterly fatigued parched famished lost suffocating darkness desperately search refuge bleary eye catch sight looming dark silhouette mansion cloaked deepest shadow night feeling wall dark blessed luck feel like utter disrespect oppressive darkness around managed grasp doorknob first attempt unlocked fumbling blindly confirm every entry point ground floor remains sealed shut denying solace fearful prying eye ear determine sanctuary lie mansion upper floor enter suite seeking shelter behind fortress barricaded door window house entrance bedroom threshold ultimately final barrier bathroom door within confines hope slightest reminiscence peace fleeting moment respite encroaching chaos outside pray barrier confine within enough wake slumber muster remaining dwindling vigor chance new sanctuary breached looming every ounce strength left battered punished body hasten towards coveted sanctuary yearning sip last water drop city water supply eating remains canned dog food push open bathroom door last portal salvation fate unveils malevolent mockery one sought refuge within wall another soul idea sealing fate long ago someone met demise room lifeless corpse stand motionless grim sentinel guarding bathroom puppet chance devoid purpose waiting unsuspecting prey perfectly set trap like mousetrap anticipates unwitting mouse swing door open gateway either salvation damnation exhausted state famished sleepless body unable react swiftly enough reanimated corpse lunge rotten fang sinking deep jugular

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. 

I feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. 

The Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).
Tripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. 

The cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. 

Being a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. 

They have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. 

All that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.

 It feels like the game starts as a ""hunting sim"" and becomes a ""poaching sim"" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...""ethically?"".


Again, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game.

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"I really want to recommend this game, but even ignoring the performance issues (which are being patched and have improved), there are just too many basic bugs to justify buying at this price, at this time.
I'm sure the devs are not happy with the amount of negative reviews, and as someone who works in software development, I suspect it is a management push to hit a deadline regardless of quality that has hurt this game.
There are just too many fundamental things that are wrong, only some of which have been fixed. e.g. commercial zoning has only just been fixed, was completely unbalanced with no shoppers regardless of population. Garbage trucks clone garbage instead of incinerating it leading to massive backlogs. Hydro electric power plain doesn't work. At all.
The release should have been delayed until the game was actually working. They knew performance was an issue, and they must have known there was a massive list of fundamental bugs. What should have been a well received game by an existing fan base is now just annoying and alienating, and most former fans have lost all faith in colossal. I certainly won't buy another of their games at release and for full price.
 I'm sure this will be a great game at some point, but that point is not now.

1062090,Timberborn,"10:30 pm: Kids are in bed. Timberborn is on sale. Let's give this thing a whirl finally.

7:30 am: Wife is asking me why I am still up. I try to explain to her that my new maple farm finally matured and my beavers can now finally finish my super dam. With it they will achieve the largest reservoir of water ever witnessed by beaverkind. She doesn't understand why the ever present danger of droughts fading into the annals of beaver history is so significant. She wordlessly hands me a very awake baby and walks away to start her work day.

Joking aside, although that story is based on actual events, this game is pretty fun. It's a harsh environment colony builder like many others. It isn't as ruthless as some, Banished comes to mind, that can see your colony come to ruin quite quickly due to fairly easy to make oversights on your part. Oh, don't get me wrong. You can accidentally kill your beavers. It is easy to starve them to death. Early on it'll be due to mismanaging the most important resource of the game, water. Later on when you have a thriving beaver metropolis, it'll be because you ran out of water.

Yes, both times the problem was water. The problem will always be water. Well, sometimes the problem is there aren't enough logs if you had every log in the universe; But mostly, it's water.

When you are new catastrophe will probably come from mismanaging your rivers. Late game it'll be because you struggle to hold enough water to survive the ever more severe droughts.

But water my friends. Water! That is what makes this game so much fun. Your beavers actually manage your resources pretty well on their own once you've got them set up. Where you, ever present godlike figure in the sky, come in is planning out how to extract every ounce of value you can from that precious blue stuff flowing by in the river. Your oh so cuddly civilization consists of an army of super cute beavers! And beavers like to build dams. So build dams you will. Build dams you must.

You will use epic tons of lumber to channel and shape the flow of the water. Build large reservoirs that you can release bit by bit as your beavers drink up their little stream during a long drought. Build dams to create beaver made waterfalls that increase the speed of the current. Force that water into a tighter channel to create even more water speed. Then build water wheels to milk that fast flowing water for power to run your industry.

1260320,Party Animals,"[h1] You must be curious why this game has so many negative reviews in Chinese. [/h1]
For English speakers:
If you know what this game has done in China, you will know why Chinese players give so many negative reviews to a game produced by a Chinese studio.
They had released a demo three years ago, when the epidemic was in lockdown and everyone was at home with nothing to do. If they had released the game then, it would have been a monumental achievement in the history of gaming, probably on par with 2016's Overwatch. But they didn't, insisting that the game needed more processing, which took almost four years. The pandemic is over, and naturally people don’t have time to play party games. 
This is actually not the point. I just want to complain a bit as a player who has waited for so long. [h3] The real point begins here. [/h3]
Before the game was finally released, the producers made it clear in interviews that their nitpicks resulted in the game being too expensive to run, and [u] they were not shy about making it clear that they were prepared to make players pay for the company's operational missteps. [/u] [b] However, there doesn’t seem to be much problem with the price in Europe or the United States? [/b] 
We all know that games on Steam are priced differently in different countries, which usually depends on economic conditions and exchange rates. The same type of party games are often priced [b] half [/b] as much in China as in the United States, while Party Animals are almost the [b ]same [/b] price as in the United States. To refer back to the previous paragraph, [u] they were not shy about making it clear that they were prepared to make players pay for the company's operational missteps. [/u]  [h3] So, let’s guess which players bear this cost? [/h3]
[b] Any promotions and announcements from the studio based in English are a mask of hypocrisy as they have never released the same content in Chinese, [/b] even though this is a Chinese studio. Their attitude towards Chinese players is ignorance and arrogance. [u] Some people posted videos on China's YouTube (some of you may have heard of it, namely bilibili) exposing the company's different treatment of English users and Chinese players. However, these videos were subsequently reported and deleted by the company, and any negative comments and questions raised by the player community have also been blocked and deleted without an official reply. [/u]
[b] Finally, I'll talk about what's really about the game itself. [/b] After almost four years of work, what's the difference between a game and a demo? I don't know how many of you have played that demo, but the answer is, [b] almost nothing, [/b] except for some paid skins and raffle boxes.
In addition, in China, the in-game currency was officially designated as ""ni mo bi"". If translated into English, it would be, "" [spoiler] phack u coin/dollar [/spoiler] "", just read it out. [strike] Could this be an unintentional mistake? [/strike]
Yes, this has nothing to do with any non-Chinese people. I just want to show that our anger is not unfounded. [h2] Chinese player have indeed suffered unfair treatment from a Chinese company. [/h2] How ironic! But if you still can’t understand the reason for so many bad reviews based on Chinese, then I can only wish you good luck.",h1 must curious game many negative review chinese h1 english speaker know game done china know chinese player give many negative review game produced chinese studio released demo three year ago epidemic lockdown everyone home nothing released game would monumental achievement history gaming probably par 2016 overwatch insisting game needed processing took almost four year pandemic naturally people time play party game actually point want complain bit player waited long h3 real point begin h3 game finally released producer made clear interview nitpicks resulted game expensive run u shy making clear prepared make player pay company operational misstep u b however seem much problem price europe united state b know game steam priced differently different country usually depends economic condition exchange rate type party game often priced b half b much china united state party animal almost b b price united state refer back previous paragraph u shy making clear prepared make player pay company operational misstep u h3 let guess player bear cost h3 b promotion announcement studio based english mask hypocrisy never released content chinese b even though chinese studio attitude towards chinese player ignorance arrogance u people posted video china youtube may heard namely bilibili exposing company different treatment english user chinese player however video subsequently reported deleted company negative comment question raised player community also blocked deleted without official reply u b finally talk really game b almost four year work difference game demo know many played demo answer b almost nothing b except paid skin raffle box addition china game currency officially designated ni mo bi translated english would spoiler phack u coin dollar spoiler read strike could unintentional mistake strike yes nothing non chinese people want show anger unfounded h2 chinese player indeed suffered unfair treatment chinese company h2 ironic still understand reason many bad review based chinese wish good luck

230410,Warframe,"First, good things about Warframe:

This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.

This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?

Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.

What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.
What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.

Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.
But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.

Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.

How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.

------------------------------------
Now, bad things about warframe:

-PVP sucks
-Grinding, lots of grinding.
-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.
-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.

------------------------------------
About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.
------------------------------------

Final thoughts.

Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.

In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.

Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10

1062090,Timberborn,"Fun game with frustrating district range limits.

Pros:
-Terraforming - The ability to re-shape the land as you see fit with explosives/platforms. No mountain is too high, no land too dry. You can redirect rivers and create artificial reservoirs.
-Beaver tech - The buildings all fit the theme and are quite creative.
-Physics - There is a lot you can do with the water mechanics. If you screw up river flow layout, your water wheels won't spin. If you block a water path, the river overflows somewhere else. Gotta keep an eye on things so you don't accidentally flood yourself from another direction or overspill if you have more water flowing in than out.

Cons:
-District system - The game forcibly fragments your colony. The beavers can only walk ~70 squares of pathing from the district center. This means that to reach outer regions where all the scrap is, you need to set up a new district, which if not exploited properly means your new district starts from scratch (even if your main district is drowning in resources, the new one can't touch it and will starve to death even if you have a warehouse 1 block past the district limit gate).
-Tutorial - It doesn't cover dams or their necessary parts (dam, levee, floodgate etc.) at all, yet you will wipe by the 2nd drought if you don't figure it out yourself. It also doesn't explain the various resource icons, which would be nice to see. Neither does it tell you about pathing limits which will screw up your layout.
-Beaver job assignment - When you have more jobs than population, you can't just pick up a beaver from 1 building and tell him to work in another. You have to progressively ""pause"" every other production building until the place you want him to go is the only one still open. If you don't learn this, your beavers will die of thirst working in a factory because you can't tell them to go operate the water pump.
-Power system cheating - The game has 2 sources of self sufficient power: Water wheel which works full time until a drought and windmill which has variable power based on wind strength. However, I've been observing patterns that don't feel random at all. My windmills keep operating during regular weather, often at full power, yet the moment a drought comes the wind magically vanishes. It defeats the purpose of a backup power system.

Tips:
-New districts - So far one of the best methods I found for setting up a new district is to build a warehouse/log pile/water storage at the limit of your current district, then once they get filled up, place a district gate before them and connect the path to a new district center. This way your new district is already full of starting resources which your beavers can use. When you start running low, you can always move the district gate back to let your primary district fill up your storage. This is often easier to deal with than the distribution network which needs extra beavers, lots of space and is a one way system in each case.
-Connector districts - You don't have to set up a fully functional district to cross the map, but you do need district overlaps to get further out. What helps me is a dummy district with a district center ~60 blocks away from my current limit with nothing but pathing towards my district and the place I want to go. As long as you get overlaps, you can double migrate your beavers to the final location which can be a lot further out.
-Dams - You don't need to build high river borders to create reservoirs. When the river dries up, build stairs into it and fill up the riverbed with explosives. You can make it deeper so the water lasts longer the next time. Focus on the edges near your crops/trees first. You should also always have a little dead end away from the river to create a static reservoir to prevent crops/trees from dying. Even a single line of water 2 blocks deep survives a long drought and keeps everything alive.",fun game frustrating district range limit pro terraforming ability shape land see fit explosive platform mountain high land dry redirect river create artificial reservoir beaver tech building fit theme quite creative physic lot water mechanic screw river flow layout water wheel spin block water path river overflow somewhere else got ta keep eye thing accidentally flood another direction overspill water flowing con district system game forcibly fragment colony beaver walk 70 square pathing district center mean reach outer region scrap need set new district exploited properly mean new district start scratch even main district drowning resource new one touch starve death even warehouse 1 block past district limit gate tutorial cover dam necessary part dam levee floodgate etc yet wipe 2nd drought figure also explain various resource icon would nice see neither tell pathing limit screw layout beaver job assignment job population pick beaver 1 building tell work another progressively pause every production building place want go one still open learn beaver die thirst working factory tell go operate water pump power system cheating game 2 source self sufficient power water wheel work full time drought windmill variable power based wind strength however observing pattern feel random windmill keep operating regular weather often full power yet moment drought come wind magically vanishes defeat purpose backup power system tip new district far one best method found setting new district build warehouse log pile water storage limit current district get filled place district gate connect path new district center way new district already full starting resource beaver use start running low always move district gate back let primary district fill storage often easier deal distribution network need extra beaver lot space one way system case connector district set fully functional district cross map need district overlap get help dummy district district center 60 block away current limit nothing pathing towards district place want go long get overlap double migrate beaver final location lot dam need build high river border create reservoir river dry build stair fill riverbed explosive make deeper water last longer next time focus edge near crop tree first also always little dead end away river create static reservoir prevent crop tree dying even single line water 2 block deep survives long drought keep everything alive
899770,Last Epoch,"Like the lovechild of Diablo and Path of Exile that has the best features of both, Last Epoch is everything I'm looking for in an Arpg.  From the diverse classes, to the unique boss attacks and patterns, to the robust filter--Last Epoch gets all the small details right. However, I have to say it's the intuitive crafting systems for both skills and items that's the real winner. I never liked crafting in other games because it was always buried beneath a byzantine system of checks and balances. Here, they handle crafting as a more WYSIWYG affair. You know what you're getting and, with the items, you know the success probability of it being crafted without a hitch. No more mixing recipes or putting runes in a certain order--do you want to add damage, or speed, or cheaper mana cost. Then by the effing gods that's what you need to find and that's what you craft onto your item. Period.

Once multiplayer is added and the story to completion is added, I literally think this has the foundation to blow 95% of the other Arpg's out of the water--including Grim Dawn and PoE. The barrier for entry is low, but the path to mastery is still long and exciting. In my book that's the winning combination.",like lovechild diablo path exile best feature last epoch everything looking arpg diverse class unique bos attack pattern robust filter last epoch get small detail right however say intuitive crafting system skill item real winner never liked crafting game always buried beneath byzantine system check balance handle crafting wysiwyg affair know getting item know success probability crafted without hitch mixing recipe putting rune certain order want add damage speed cheaper mana cost effing god need find craft onto item period multiplayer added story completion added literally think foundation blow 95 arpg water including grim dawn poe barrier entry low path mastery still long exciting book winning combination

1938090,Call of Duty®,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.

11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",pre ordered vault edition downloaded early access campaign played 2 1 2 hour game crashed rebooted account permanently banned excuse contacted blizzard sent activision repealed ban activison denied unauthorized use software permanent activision ban never cheated even know access anything oh also gladly took 100 dollar non refundable 2 hour gameplay imagine game bugged server awful care customer 11 6 2022 update thread amazing laughed hard awhile thank taking time comment cod community hilarious let fill everyone happened discovered originally purchased game battle net inital perm ban occured left review first place reached activision numerous time 0 luck information even talk person work repealed ban instantly revoked received automated response ban enforced permanent nothing requested refund denied well battle net server logged 2 hour gameplay obviously campaign since early access also blizzard contacted link account ban take blizzard mad wanted play campaign purchased game second time steam created new activision account know steam great refund played 2 hour hence 1 7 hour logged banned right 1 7 hour know hardware ban insane requested refund steam instantly got back whatever tried said done 3 week later wake decide download battle net check account status unbanned like nothing ever happened idea happened saw thread blowing read comment checked every program installed pc constantly running background task manager one read could potentially cause issue corsair icue 4 software literally app make ram stick color red lol uninstalled safe back playing headache never know happened 3 ish week disappeared dealing issue really cheater anything wrong hope thread help activision take responsibility fact anti cheat software trash tell difference regular software malicious software really issue thanks intelligence actual input commented

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.

As a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.

Lore: 
If I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.

Gameplay: 
Top notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.

There are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. 

Combat:
My first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.

Classes/Races:
Well handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.

Races are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.

Community:
Generally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.

Crafting:
Only mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.

Real money:
Yes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.

Overall:
I love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. 

If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored.

your cdms are man marked by strikers (Yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too !!!!!!!)
90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to score
for those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you something
there is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymore
its all about being a rat and have some luck

552990,World of Warships,"***PVE review - because PVP is unbelievably toxic*** I hate this game in its current state... I only play it because there is no other (pve-ish) Capital Ship simulator that I have found.  Wargaming.net purchased my previous PVP & PVE favorite, Fractured Space, and this is what I'm left with.  And Dreadnought is dying the same death.

Inbalance is the name of the game now, the power creep is real.  They seem to only be interested in players spending more actual currency and purchasing ""premium ships.""  They used to be worse than the experience-obtainable tech tree ships, not anymore.  They used to have more than 5 PVE ""Operations"" allowing for fun and rewarding PVE gameplay, now they make random ways to increase difficulty without doing any investment (enemy ships several levels below yours given perfect aim and (ever) increased damage.  And this game has lost the ""Historical"" tag for me, as they have added ships which never sailed and have capabilities unrealistically exceeding those same-level ships that did.  And they cannot decide on a CV mechanic, so they seem to change it once people have become used to the previous one.  And if you want to bypass any challenge and kill-steal your way to the top, just play a ship of the favored nation: the Soviets.

What I like is still there: The ships are beautifully rendered which is great; they obviously have put great investment into that.  There is fun in seeing what-if designs come to life, provided respect is still shone to the older ships.   The challenge of maneuverability and dodging shots from afar through tactical foresight is great.  And the feeling of power when my battleship full-broadside shoots another is lacking in every other game that I have played.

If the devs/Wargaming would invest into what they already have, and put out the old PVE scenarios again, instead of constantly bringing new ships into existence with tactics that make the older ships unable to succeed, I would be happy.  If they would perfect what they have (CVs or Operations for instance) instead of searching for a new power inbalance they can add, it would be better.   And if they would STOP NERFING THE OLDER SHIPS TO PUSH FOR NEWER SHIPS, IT WOULD BE GREAT!!! (German secondary accuracy and British Battleship citadels are things that didn't need to be changed!)

I have played too long in this game and given too much money to them.  I thought my investment was worth something, but apparently there is no respect - only greed.  This makes me sad.  And yearn for another capital ship simulator (on sea or in space) where I can drive my mass of steel into a firefight and wither the enemy (RIP Leviathan).

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] The Elder Scrolls Online - Tamriel Unlimited [/h1]

[h1] Introduction [/h1]

Tamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul. 

[h1] Review -11/26/15 [/h1]
[b] Graphics [/b]

Tamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. 

EDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: 
Skyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.

8/10

[b] PvE [/b]

Player vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.

4.5/10

[b] PvP [/b]

If you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-

The Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)
The Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)
The Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)
(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)

There are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.
The PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.

9.5/10

[b] UI/Levelling [/b]

The UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.

8.5/10

[b] Crafting [/b]

I'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.
It's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.

8/10

[b] Framerate [/b]

I play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.

9/10 

[b] Grouping [/b]

The group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.

7/10

[b] Conclusion [/b]

This game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.

[b] OVERALL: 8.5/10 [/b]

the real turning point in this series was CMS 2018, it introduced so much new stuff into the game. New cars, new parts, a repair table, tuning, dyno, more tools, more customization, more skills, the ability to buy used cars and flip them for a profit. It was great fun, and I was really excited for CMS 2021.

I picked it up on release and after 10 hours or so I realized this is exactly like CMS 2018 with a fresh coat of paint, some new cars and a few QOL improvements here and there. We've been waiting 3 years for this? Everything you can do in CMS 2018 you can do here, it's no different, except for some ""new"" mechanics.

1062090,Timberborn,"TLDR:
In current state a really nice zen game. Stability and performance are good. Not very deep - as of now. Research is currently terrible.

Issues:
It's an early access game, so there are issues related to it. 
1) The game seems rather short on content, as it is, it is rather a zen-like game, where you just happily build loads of housing complexes, that may not be efficient, but they just look nice. 
Production chains are very simple, and there aren't many. I really hope more are getting added later in the development, because I see huge potential for deeper gameplay.
2) Research: You can set up multiple settlements in the same game, called districts. Then make them transfer stuff and pop from one to another. This is nice, but having to research the ""distribution"" outpost and the ""receiving"" outpost separately, seems like a mistake, as these buildings are absolutely useless without one another and that's very telling of the current state of Research in the game - redundant and frustrating. I am pretty sure I've seen the dev response somewhere mentioning Research is getting a rework, but, I'd just straight up disable it until the rework is done. As it stands now, the research is just an extra layer that makes you build things in a way you don't like, until you get things like platforms and bridges, taking away A LOT of the joy you could've had in the early to mid game. Research is done through a single building, you're expected to spam. It requires no resources and no energy, just one beaver... and that feels pretty dumb and unsatisfying. I'd expect research to open up ways in which you can certain things, like, windmills instead of water wheels. I get that you don't need a windmill, but it may be situationally better building, hence available though research. What I don't get is locking simple wooden platforms, and thing like the Forester building behind research. You absolutely need forester, and you can also pretty much softlock yourself if you kill all the forests without having built the forester, which seems pretty stupid. Wooden platforms and stairs are essential to any ""fun"" you can get from building, so those should be absolutely available from get go. + You've already got mechanics that stop you from building ""advanced"" buildings to start with, such as, different materials. Research as it is currently implemented is just redundant, unsatisfying and frustrating. It's also easy to tell there wasn't much development time spent on its current implementation. 
3) They feel like hamsters: They are visually beavers, but there are no swimming or underwater mechanics... there's even a hamster wheel as power source. I really hope they add some beaver mechanics related to water beside few different types of dams.
4) Maps have size limit: Why? If I wanna run a pointlessly large map, just let me (unless it's limited by the engine or smth). The outpost mechanics would flourish in huge worlds.
5) Main danger is easily beaten. No matter how long the droughts last, they're easily beat by a few dams and water storage spam. 

Suggestions/examples for present issues
LOW CHALLENGE:
Rains (in 3 days - rain instead of drought) -> need for drying canals. Floods with flotsam , damaging dams if the flotsam is travelling at higher speed - need for flotsam breakers/water speed control - there needs to be a punishment for slowing the water too much - water Power wheels need to scale with water flow speed, current implementation, where you put water power wheel into stale water and somehow it generates 180pwr seems very off. 

Food should spoil over time. Food conservation techniques - many options for research. (underwater warehouse - realistically lower temp - food there spoils slowly. Canned food, other conservation methods. Spoiled food = fertilizer - extra production in future as balance set off (similar effect to beehive, Flag with ""x"" storage for fertilizer, effect in ""y"" radius).
Spoil speed should be affected by warehouse placement 
(for example on ground, ""spoil rate"" = 1 - (""amount of adjacent ground""*0.05 + ""roof surface""*0.05 - ""warehouse surface""*0.05); ""time until spoiled"" = ""given food endurance""-""spoil rate""*time, if (""time until spoiled""<=0) then ""given food"" = ""fertilizer"".)

MORE WATER STUFF, example: addition of water vegetation as food source - vegetation grows on the riverbed - potential for purposeful drying of parts of the river, to collect loads of food from the riverbed quickly, or long term diving posts (essentially a Flag next to river). Water vegetation would just grow on the riverbed over time, making it yet another food source.
Underwater housing (inside/adjacent to dams). These pops would get water from their housing, but the housing would be very resource heavy.

RESEARCH labs could be semi-advanced buildings, requiring power, multiple beavers, and research specific resources. Example: If you wanna research a windmill, you need a bunch of cogs, planks and wood, and X amount of time, which can be divided by the amount of hamsters working in the particular lab - but, more hamsters working means more Power required... The building would need to *ding* once research was done, or no research was in progress, requiring extra input from the player by making him choose the next research. But I don't see that as an issue, as the game isn't exactly micro heavy. They could probably slap that on top of a research tree, but really, they need more buildings for that sort of thing, 70% of the buildings available should be considered essential and unlocked from the start... so... like... but I am fine with any other solution that doesn't completely suck as well though.

//Edit: 28.9.: After playing some more, I'd like to list a couple of extra suggestions
Windmills seem too unreliable. That is not exactly an issue, as it seems about right. What doesn't seem about right is the lack of compensation techniques.
Ex. lets say that your windmill system provides 500 power per average (peak being 800, minimum 0 (no wind)), within 400 power required system. As it is now, you might as well end up with 60% efficiency due to lows and zeroes, even though your system provides more than enough average power. Energy produced outside of working hours is also getting wasted.
Solution - inertia batteries. Since there is no stone in the game, you could just make mid sized, hollow wooden wheels filled with water (with a piece of plywood across the insides, so you wouldn't get the water spinning independently to the wheel and lose a bunch of kinetic energy to fluid friction). These would work essentially as any other power consuming building, with a twist, being, it only consumes Power when the system has extra, and the other way around - being a power source when the system lacks power, while having given max power stored capacity and max power provided stats. These stats could be realistically given by max tolerated stresses inside the transmissions and mechanics of the ""inertia battery"". Switching between modes could be done by centrifugal transmissions - so, it should make sense.
Could also make the water levels within the wheels deteriorate over time, hence giving them water consumption and making them more interactive.

Another suggestion, that might help the water gameplay, are water pumps and pipes. Think they would be fun.//


Conclusion: Fun, but very much a work in progress, rather short on content. Meaning it's not really a complex strategy game (yet). But, the mechanics and graphics currently present in the game (beside Research, which should be temporarily disabled until reworked, imo), are solid enough to make it a fun zen game, where you just build stuff and enjoy looking at the beavers go ham. I see great potential on what it could become, I hope the devs won't disappoint. So far it seems like they've been very responsive to the feedback, which is also one of the main reasons I've bought into this early access.",tldr current state really nice zen game stability

- Better roleplaying and story generation through a focus on key personality traits,

- the warfare aspect is much more in depth and allows for some spectacular specialization,

- the economy system actually makes you care about the lands your dynasty holds and you can actually play tall using it,

- the hooks, secrets and scheming system is simply outstanding and adds so many layers to the interactions, especially with friends in multiplayer,

- the Religion system with an ability to set tenets, doctrines, with faiths having interlocking interactions is the most complex implementation of religion in a Paradox game and allows for some truly unique playstyles (some things are not very realistic at game start, but they'll improve with patches)

- finally, the technology system is so incredibly improved over Crusader Kings 2, that it might be my favorite new feature in this game. The way it interacts with realm laws, warfare, economy, and with cultural / regional ideas, makes learning a viable path to specialize your family in through the midgame.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"**Note: I put almost 1,000 hours into this game before the Steam Release**

I see a lot of reviews on here complaining about Pay 2 Win features. As a person who has put as much time as I did while spending ZERO dollars, I can say wholeheartedly that you can absolutely enjoy this game without spending a dime.

There are two in-game currencies in MTGA; gems, and gold.  If you do the daily quests at the bottom of the home page you can start accruing gold through meeting the requirements in any game mode. You can use the gold to buy draft tokens, the top tier draft costing 10,000 gold.  Each draft adds the cards you draft to your collection, and you get pack and gem rewards depending on how many wins you get before three losses.

Grind the gold, save your gems, and when you have enough, spend the gems on the season pass.  It becomes exponentially easier to get gold, cards, and gems after unlocking the season pass.  From there you can keep the cycle up. Make fun decks, try different game modes, keep it interesting.

And when wasn’t Magic expensive / pay to win?! Paper Magic was never free! This game gives you the opportunity to do everything FOR FREE! So enough with the complaints!

Final Pros / Cons:
+Steam version initially runs very well compared to my old installs. Less loading, less glitchy.
+F2P model isn’t that difficult to grind around.
+New card sets come out quarterly, keeping the gameplay fresh and the meta changing.
+TONS of redemption codes available to get a head start as a new player. Just google MTGA card codes and you can get a head start on building your decks.
+Tutorial and beginner friendly modes like explorer help the learning curve. 
+Flashy visuals and cool sound effects.

-Only 1v1 matches.
-No chat function, just emote wheel (which is pretty much just as toxic as chat).
-Sore losers roping (running the timer down when losing to drag out a game).
-Fair share of toxicity in the community… but what game doesn’t have that nowadays.

Overall this is the best digital version of Magic in my opinion. I find tons of enjoyment in the game without paying a cent. Just make sure to READ THE CARDS as you play!

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.

There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. 

Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.

If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.

2198510,New Cycle,"Putting in a review at about 5 hours in, The game is a slow start and took like 1 hour to get to the real bulk of it. Overall the game seems fun. The research is kind of annoying with it gate keeping you from tech but it's opening up will follow up on this when I get farther into the game.

Update,

I've made it to the end game and I'm excited to play more. The only problem is, the end of the game isn't out yet from what I've read on the forums. So I'm going to keep an eye on this game and when it does have an end, I'm going to replay it. 

I will say the game does get better as it goes on, a lot to manage and there is actually something that pushes you to go fast, Idk why they don't really push it in the beginning but you do have a time limit.",putting review 5 hour game slow start took like 1 hour get real bulk overall game seems fun research kind annoying gate keeping tech opening follow get farther game update made end game excited play problem end game yet read forum going keep eye game end going replay say game get better go lot manage actually something push go fast idk really push beginning time limit
216150,MapleStory,"This game has the potential to be great. The concept of a 2D MMORPG that's all animated is pretty cool, and there's a lot of charm in this game. I currently have a level 230 Kinesis in Reboot (I use nexon launcher instead of steam) and I've (somewhat) enjoyed the grind up to that point. The community at least in the server I play in is large and thriving. However, this game has major problems that's been in the game for as long as I can remember.

Pros:
- Tons of options in terms of which class/job you want to play with + no big loss of time if you change your main (passive benefits for each char you play)
- Great and flashy animation for a lot of moves, some of the characters you can play can feel extremely fluid
- Customization options are massive (comes with a catch mentioned in cons)
- Large community
- Constant updates and events are happening 

Cons:
- Tons and tons and tons of bugs (I cannot stress this enough), includes: buggy bossfights, broken UI, frequent game crashes, possible false ban, very laggy servers (in reboot, idk how it is in other servers)
- Non-reboot servers: very p2w, Reboot servers: overwhelmingly grindy
- Cosmetics is expensive/not worth the price: getting the look you want is based on rng a lot of times or it's time limited
- Nexon
Let me elaborate on the last point in the cons section. This company has been overwhelmingly incompetent when it comes to developing Maplestory. The company has been making extremely controversial balancing decisions for the game, as if they are purposely trying to slow down progression so as to increase the amount of money players have to put in this game. They have no transparency whatsoever. They often change the game without mentioning it in patch notes. They have also done nothing to fix the known problems of the game that has been here for the longest time. 

My main point of this review is, if you want to play for nostalgia's sake or just to try it out as a completely new player, go for it. It's a nice experience to try this game (if you get lucky and don't get bugged out), and you can clearly see the charm this game has. However, I would STRONGLY recommend NOT to play this game if you are looking for a game to spend a lot of time in. Nexon has shown little to no interest in listening to the community and they probably never will. You would be better off playing in a different game where the company actually cares about their community and things are hell of a lot more polished than this game is.",game potential great concept 2d mmorpg animated pretty cool lot charm game currently level 230 kinesis reboot use nexon launcher instead steam somewhat enjoyed grind point community least server play large thriving however game major problem game long remember pro ton option term class job want play big loss time change main passive benefit char play great flashy animation lot move character play feel extremely fluid customization option massive come catch mentioned con large community constant update event happening con ton ton ton bug stress enough includes buggy bossfights broken ui frequent game crash possible false ban laggy server reboot idk server non reboot server p2w reboot server overwhelmingly grindy cosmetic expensive worth price getting look want based rng lot time time limited nexon let elaborate last point con section company overwhelmingly incompetent come developing maplestory company making extremely controversial balancing decision game purposely trying slow progression increase amount money player put game transparency whatsoever often change game without mentioning patch note also done nothing fix known problem game longest time main point review want play nostalgia sake try completely new player go nice experience try game get lucky get bugged clearly see charm game however would strongly recommend play game looking game spend lot time nexon shown little interest listening community probably never would better playing different game company actually care community thing hell lot polished game

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I have over 6 thousand  hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:

It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out. 

Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game. 

Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game. Fingers crossed they are working on PUBG 2 in the background and will fix all the current issues.",6 thousand hour game ground stand come posting honest review game fun game playing right people really care much actual game play care game play find game feel outdated clunky movement still several bug several year old patched cheater constant problem game likely running blatant cheater every 1 3 game know people think guy getting wrecked people better know talking reason many hour game used competitive player several year like think know spot cheater people good game honestly say game hard time lot fun keep returning many issue need resolved krafton addressing whole heatedly recommend game finger crossed working pubg 2 background fix current issue
949230,Cities: Skylines II,"The game in it's current state is not great, aside from the performance issues that they are supposedly fixing, the game's core has some insane issues and almost completely ruins the experience for me. 

1, None of the cims you see and the cars you see matter, they are purely there for the visuals as the cims seem to mostly idle in home and aimlessly walk around, they don't seem to really be connected to the game's simulation aspect.

2. The 1st point also applies to traffic jams and cargo trucks, as they don't seem to impact the overall economy or anything like that. In C:S 1, whenever you would have a traffic jam, especially in bigger cities, you would notice a decline in your economy and would notice buildings and businesses not doing so well because of that, in C:S 2, none of that seems to matter, as your citizens just don't care about a silly little traffic jam or car accidents or whatever.

3. Importing is free, yes you heard me right, importing is free (or costs very little, as they don't detail the costs anywhere, I just have to assume it's free based on how much my services cost even when importing everything).

You can also import anything such as ambulances, hearses, fire trucks, police cars and cargo. This creates a massive problem where it feels like there is no point building clinics and fire stations and police stations (the only reason to build a police station is to increase citizen happiness bc they for some reason don't like a high crime rate, so at least there is something). 
So this creates a massive problem where you can exploit the game as follows: 

You can start up a city, build your power plant and water stuff (or import that too if you really want, but these are about the only thing that costs money to import), keep building commercial zones and residential zones and absolutely nothing else, play on high speed and watch as your city grows to 3k pop in no time. 

Imagine spending all that time carefully placing hospitals, police stations, fire houses, landfills and incineration plants (or recycling centres if you're more green than me) and trying to manage traffic, just to then realise you don't even need to build them because they can just be imported and it costs you nothing and that traffic management is irrelevant to the simulation aspect of the game. 

4. Natural disasters don't really seem to have a massive impact, if any at all. I had an entire tornado go through my city for quite some time, yet it only seemed to ""damage"" buildings, because as soon as the tornado got off a specific building, the building was suddenly 100% perfect and had no issues. Unless of course the tornado needs to sit in one spot it's entire lifespan and only then will you see a building destroyed, which is also impossible and stupid. Every other natural disaster doesn't really do much, and I'm not even sure if I've discovered all of them because so far I've only seen forest fires and tornadoes.

5. Shops always have low customers, even when you have a bunch of apartments and high density buildings around shops, there still seems to be one or two shops that somehow have low customers, which further proves that the citizens in the game just don't seem to be simulated, it's all being done in the background where you can't see it.

There's also problems with low rent housing not even taking in any citizens when you first unlock it and it just ends up in the buildings being abandoned, you bulldoze it, it gets rebuilt and the cycle repeats.

That's about it really, I'll update this review if anything changes, but at the moment, the game is extremely disappointing when you realise that the simulation game you just bought is only 20% simulated and the rest is purely visual and sometimes the visual is buggy and messed up. I loved Cities: Skylines 1, but this game at the moment is a joke.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"This is usually not the type of game I play. This is the most linear game I have ever played which usually is something I extremely dislike, but weirdly enough I really enjoyed this game.

In this game you can't jump, the only thing you can interact with is opening doors, climbing ladders, picking up a torch, listening to the stories from the rune stones. Literally can't do anything other than that. There are no items to collect, no nothing, just battles, jogging, and cut scenes. Everything I hate, all in one game. Yet I enjoyed this game.

I think it's the whole, sad, creepy, eerie, and dark ambient atmosphere, the music together with the norse theme, and the beautiful graphics. What impressed me the most was the unique binaural audio, the highlight of the whole game experience. The game being based on psychosis, all those whispering sounds gave me chills so many times. It felt like the voices were right behind me, whispering right next to my ears, it's hard to explain but it felt so real. It was a little annoying at first, I was wondering when it would stop, but it grew on me after a while. I can't imagine what it would be like for people who live with psychosis everyday. The voices were making fun of Senua, but also helping her during fights, then criticizing and belittling her, but also cheering for her. It sure was a roller coaster of feelings. 

The illusions were so trippy, I had no idea what was going on but then I realized my eyes were being tricked. I liked the challenges, loved the fighting, even if I played on hard mode it was really easy to beat the game. 
I wish there could be more to the game, the lack of interaction other than walking made the game feel empty. I hope the sequel will be greater. I wish you could skip the cut scenes. Many of them were really long especially if you want to re-play some chapters.

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","So let us start by listing the good points, because the game has very many; 
- A solid story, at least until chapter 3. 
- A solid alteration of the Rogue Trader TTRPG system that manages to capture much the same feeling whilst shedding some of its clunkiest parts. 
- Fun combats that are well balanced, until the start of Chapter 4. 
- Perhaps the most lore accurate representation of the 40k universe I've ever seen in a game, a real delight for the old hands and the new out there who want to sink their teeth into something substantial. In fact, the attention to such things almost made me recommend the game. Almost. 

Now we must list the bad points. 
I can't actually give you a review of the full game, because on two separate runs I've been stymied by bugs at the start of or during Chapter 4. However, with almost 150 hours in the game I think I can offer something in regards to an opinion on its quality. 
- The combat, which was previously very well thought through and engaging appears to have been taken from whatever skilled hand was working on it and instead given to a monkey with a degree in Faffing About. Combats swing from trivial and utterly unmemorable to nut-flatteningly hard seemingly at random.  
- The story. It picks up the pace and starts becoming genuinely interesting and then Chapter 3 happens at you, and all that momentum falls out of a window, tragically breaking its neck and dying. After Chapter 3 has finished happening at you, you're thrown right back into it. With absolutely 0 momentum behind you, and all the driving force of an angry Sunday motorist. 
- The bugs. Emperor offer my soul salvation! The bugs! From maps lacking the ability to leave them, to quests not completing or simply duplicating. I've helped one companion get her damned papers signed three times in a row, and then I helped her find her gang. And then she left to save her gang. Then asked me to help her with her damned paperwork. I think she may be an agent of Tzeentch. Or Slaanesh, no one can enjoy the pain of that much pencil pushing drudgery but the deranged chosen of the Prince of Pleasure. 
- The quantity and quality of content also falls off very hard after Chapter 3. The cynical amongst you may believe this is because its an attempt to front load the game and make it appealing at first glance. I believe the team was abducted from their offices after completing Chapter 3 and only managed to return with a bare week before the game was released and worked their hands bloody in service to the God Emperor to give us what they could. Because if it is that first thing I'd feel like a bit of idiot as I've bought the game for friends too. Luckily though, as a devout follower of the God Emperor I can't ever be wrong. 

To conclude then: 
The game is Very Good, until it becomes Not Very Good. In the future, I hope the updates and patches that Owlcat is putting out with some solid regularity already make me recommend the game. However, given the state of the last half of the game, I can't in good conscience. It is, however, a very enjoyable game in the main. If it were not for the never ending parade of techna-nurglings in the worky-gubbins I'd recommend it without a second thought.",let u start listing good point game many solid story least chapter 3 solid alteration rogue trader ttrpg system manages capture much feeling whilst shedding clunkiest part fun combat well balanced start chapter 4 perhaps lore accurate representation 40k universe ever seen game real delight old hand new want sink teeth something substantial fact attention thing almost made recommend game almost must list bad point actually give review full game two separate run stymied bug start chapter 4 however almost 150 hour game think offer something regard opinion quality combat previously well thought engaging appears taken whatever skilled hand working instead given monkey degree faffing combat swing trivial utterly unmemorable nut flatteningly hard seemingly random story pick pace start becoming genuinely interesting chapter 3 happens momentum fall window tragically breaking neck dying chapter 3 finished happening thrown right back absolutely 0 momentum behind driving force angry sunday motorist bug emperor offer soul salvation bug map lacking ability leave quest completing simply duplicating helped one companion get damned paper signed three time row helped find gang left save gang asked help damned paperwork think may agent tzeentch slaanesh one enjoy pain much pencil pushing drudgery deranged chosen prince pleasure quantity quality content also fall hard chapter 3 cynical amongst may believe attempt front load game make appealing first glance believe team abducted office completing chapter 3 managed return bare week game released worked hand bloody service god emperor give u could first thing feel like bit idiot bought game friend luckily though devout follower god emperor ever wrong conclude game good becomes good future hope update patch owlcat putting solid regularity already make recommend game however given state last half game good conscience however enjoyable game main never ending parade techna nurglings worky gubbins recommend without second thought

[h1]The Guide[/h1]
Soo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide:
[list]
[*] Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.
[*]The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'
[*]The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of it
[*]The Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxy
[*]The Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this game
[*]The Visuals - the beauty this work of art is
[*]The Sound - and how far you can take it
[/list]
If that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409926603

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
If you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.
Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.
Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.
Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"Spoiler free review:

This is one of those times I *really* wish Steam would allow a ""maybe"" option instead of a yes or no recommendation.

Dying Light 2 doesn't quite feel like how Dying Light 1 did at all, both in terms of scale and atmosphere. I can honestly hardly call this a sequel. It feels like it's trying way too hard to be a CDPR game while at the same time also trying hard to be Dying Light, as opposed to a fully fledged sequel to the latter. Chris Avellone's presence in writing the core of the game's lore and world building would've required at least another 5, maybe 7 years of extra dev time and FAR more resources and manpower to develop than Techland already has. His departure from the team and subsequent rush to finish the game had led to extremely huge plot gaps and pacing issues. The following will sum up the things the game does good and bad, especially as a sequel to it's rather sublime first game.

[h1]The good:[/h1]
+/- The game's map is gargantuan, easily dwarfs Harran and then some. Plenty to explore, feels like a giant Mario level, tons of secrets and easter eggs. Downside however is that just about every dark zone is a literal copy paste, and there are also no Volatile nests at all barring maybe.

+ Story and sidequests are quite long and girthy, my first playthrough of the game thus far where I chugged through the story and did a fair amount, but certainly not even half of the side content, took me 65 hours. I had assigned all of the utilities to the factions and done all the bandit camps, and a handful of dark zones and anomalies.

+ Soundtrack is great.

+/- The parkour. I'll go into this in a little bit more detail further ahead.

+/- The combat. Again, will go into more detail ahead.

[h1]Now for the bad:[/h1]
- The main story. Without spoiling anything, the story is decent in premise, but executed horribly. As mentioned before, there are plot gaps, and horrible pacing issues, especially evident in the epilogue (which sucks MAJORLY by the way.) The core narrative of the game that Avellone tried to establish felt way too ambitious and Techland did not have the manpower or resources, or time to realize its full potential. 

- The dialogue. The voice acting isn't bad for most NPCs, though it felt like they got some rather average or below average VAs for a lot of their NPCs, it was largely due in part to the script writing in general for the NPCs that sucked. Dying Light hardly had this issue, but with how DL2 is trying way too hard to be an RPG without actually being an RPG, a lot of the NPC dialogue has been really poorly written, almost as if the person spoke very little English at times. (Yes I am aware Techland is a Polish game studio.)

- The atmosphere of the game and world. Dying Light had a much more gritty, horror theme to it with an atmosphere more appropriate of the period the game world was going through. This sequel meanwhile feels more or less like how Bethesda handled Fallout 4, it's not gritty anymore, it has far less horror in it, and is more fantastical (especially thanks to the more saturated color pallet) and makes it truly feel like it isn't a sequel to Dying Light but rather either a soft reboot or spiritual successor to it.

- The skill and world progression. This is partly tied into how the parkour is in the game, but the skill progression in DL2 feels way off and you get access to some really odd skill choices early in the game. What's even weirder is that the main character supposedly wandered the European wasteland for 15 years and knows almost no parkour or advanced moves off the bat. Part of this makes sense for game reasons, but narratively it makes no sense whatsoever. As for the world progression, the cool thing DL1 did was that it started off with some light, easier infected and slowly the world around you became more dangerous as more people got infected and turning, with more monstrosities being introduced over time. DL2 just throws everything at you right at the beginning. In this case, narratively it makes sense because it's some time since the world succumbed to the infection, but from a gameplay perspective it just feels wrong.

[h1]The so-so's:[/h1]
+/- As mentioned before, the parkour. They refined quite a lot of elements and made climbing a lot more fun and fast, as well as riskier + more reward thanks to adding in a stamina system, compared to DL1, and is the most fun I've had in a long time with a game that has advanced movements, possibly the best I've played thus far, trumping that of Breath of the Wild and then some. Downside however is that the jumping and movement also feels a LOT more floaty. The first ability you unlock is an increased jump height, and you can also unlock an unrealistic double-jump as well as an ability to turn 180 degrees mid-air. DL1 was a lot more like Mirror's Edge with regards to parkour and jumping, but DL2 basically turns you into a discount Spiderman, in all the best and worst ways.

+/- The combat. For the same reasons as the parkour, combat is better and worse at the same time. There is far less gore, and they removed the cool X-ray animation that DL1 had when you landed crits on anyone, and it feels a lot floatier as well. On the upside however, fights against human NPCs and zombies are a lot more interesting because you can chain some neat and effective parkour attacks and stunlocking isn't an issue anymore.

-------------------------------

Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you don't care much at all about the story and you haven't played the first game to base a lot of this stuff off of, it might do quite well as a standalone game, but as a sequel, it suffers from a LOT of drawbacks. This is essentially what is in my eyes:

The perfect 7/10 game, no more and maybe room for less. A sidegrade, rather than an upgrade or a downgrade, with lots of nuances that set it apart from the previous entry.

1313140,Cult of the Lamb,"[H1]Pros:[/h1]

+ Responsive roguelite adventure game, with base building that is interesting (despite having some flaws). Your character's ability to dodge cancel is a godsend, and every swing of your sword or shot of a curse feels weighty. 

+ One of the most well crafted and executed visual styles in an indie game I've played to date. The game weaves a mix of cartoonish cutesy and eldritch horror in everything - the scenary, characters, and monsters especially. You can't help but smile at everyone's expressive reactions, or the cute way they 'talk'. Also, Cult of the Lamb's Interface design, and overall design style, is sharp and responsive as well, with no fat whatsoever. 

+ Some pretty solid writing and world building, between the five brothers and the gods they have become. Crows will convey some deeper details if you're curious for them, and creatures of all walks of life and sizes will talk about your journey.

+ Solid music that leaves an impression and changes depending on the stage. I loved the base theme, in particular, which had a nice carefree vibe that paired well with the vibe of cutesy animals working hard or doing horrible things.

+ Customization and base building are HUGE focuses that are very fun to involve yourself in. Your cult's name, your follower's names and forms, the way they interact with each other - you have a great degree of control over these things, and it can be fun to mess with this for quite awhile. 

+ There are multiple difficulty options to choose from, making the game very accessible. On normal, I clocked a solid playtime of around 22 hours. I could easily see most people hitting a playtime of 16-20, with more or less depending on your preference on the game.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- [b] Core Flaws: [/b] The game is the definition of ""so close"". So many of its systems (weapons, curses, cloaks, abilities, cultist perks, base building, rerun mechanics, Tarot cards) are wonderful takes on the roguelite genre that, unfortunately, are only scratching the surface of their true potential. For example, the game is plagued by the ""the right choice"" problem, whether its combat (where the gold cloak is objectively the best choice when compared with useless alternatives) or upgrades (Ritual of Resurrection vs Funeral, one of many bad choices). Another example is that often many of the rewards feel pointless or lackluster, including many of the Tarot cards (poison immunity when poison is so infrequent, heart upgrades that feel meaningless, etc). ANOTHER example is that base building has weird uneven terrain, or that you cannot extend your flooring to the edges of the map. And finally, perhaps the worst example -- rerunning levels is limited to only 3 runs, and has no real point of replaying them because inevitably your runs will largely look the same. You'll start to see more cracks in the game the more you play, until, inevitably, you will think ""Ah, that sucks that it isn't deeper. It'd be cool if..."" and get lost in thoughts about ideas. It is a crying shame how much of this game could be so much better.

- [b] Followers: [/b] I love this system, but man, they got to be incredibly annoying to manage, and it really sucked that the design philosophy around them was encouraging the player to see them as disposable. Getting attached to a follower is expensive and outright impossible, whether it's because of old age, being betrayed, or needing to use them as a resource of some kind, particularly if you want to get 100% of all follower unlocks. 

- [b] Annoying enemy design: [/b] Often the only thing that ever hurt me was the smaller enemies that are unpredictable, usually because the dense foliage hid them from my sight. The first stage is still my least favorite to play because the archers and bats can very easily hit you without you even noticing. 

- [b] A bit buggy: [/b] The game is plagued with small, but annoying bugs. Some people apparently get softlocked on tiers of upgrading, or stuck in a room. There is a particularly annoying bug where the game resets your flooring to the first state you ever put down.

- [b]Misc:[/b] Snail Form is too hard to obtain, and is the only unlock I have left to find. I've run so many full runs and haven't gotten a single snail drop. I'd recommend allowing the fish merchant to sell the object, or alternatively, making them a guaranteed spawn in a certain room.


[h1]Overall:[/h1]

Cult of the Lamb's visual style is flawless. The gameplay is very fun, and the writing is well crafted and enjoyable. It is a good time well worth every cent I paid for, with a solid ending that tied everything together nicely. If you're looking for a cute, endearing game that will make you laugh and challenge you, please, buy this game!

That all being said: 

Cult of the Lamb it is not a flawless experience. It falls short of becoming the absolute best version of itself. It can learn so much from games in its genre - Enter the Gungeon's diverse selection of upgrades and weapons, Binding of Isaac's meaningful unlocks and gameplay modes, etc.

Not every game has to be this way, of course. Cult of the Lamb could exist as it is now and it would still be, at least, a great time. But it's capable of so much more, and I genuinely hope this company commits to nurturing it.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"Upon first booting it up and jumping into a game, you are going to ask yourself: ""is this it? I recruit units, put them in armies, and move them around? There's only THREE buildings to build? This game is boring!"" 

And there is where you would be wrong. Dominions is a subtly complex game. Someone who first plays the game of Chess might make the mistake of thinking the game is simple. This is also true of Dominions. Actually understanding what is going on in a Dominions game takes a long time. It takes a deliberate effort. It takes many hours of watching youtube guides and reading stat blocks. Like Chess, like Go, after a certain period of time you will experience an awakening. Suddenly you will understand why your elite troops lost to those few sacred units. You will get why your god was instantly obliterated off the battlefield by that spell. You will understand why your opponent brings a bunch of seemingly useless elephants with his army. Why that one monkey scout was somehow able to solo your entire army. Why the sun has vanished and your entire military is rioting and starving to death.

I put 1,330 hours in the last one. I imagine I'll do much the same with this one. Dominions is THE definitive fantasy strategy game. It is mainly played in multiplayer over discord servers, with one turn progressing every 24 hours. The singleplayer experience is certainly worthwhile, but the insane plays you'll encounter and perform in MP will stick with you for a lifetime. In all my time playing, I have been the winner of a game only once, which I achieved by pushing my high priests into a volcano and transforming them into dragons, then using said dragons as long range missiles to strike deep into enemy territory to claim thrones of ascension (which only high level priests can claim). I believe I am at least partially responsible for the Become Dragon spell being nerfed. The modding scene is fantastic and expands the game twice over. There's an entire guide written by the developers on how to mod, and the simple graphics make it very easy to jump into yourself by tweaking existing sprites. 

Its a fantastic game that requires an investment of time. You can play it casually, but you're just not going to get the same value of it compared to someone whos willing to put in some time to learn the mechanics and how the game works. The stuff you can do in this game is insane. The amount of power mages wield is unparalleled. You can easily wipe out entire armies by causing terrible storm, or rains of fire, or something as simple as falling stones. I'm not kidding when I say a few mages casting earthquake can and WILL wipe out hundreds or even thousands of enemy troops. For those of you who want to experience what it really feels like to be a contender for the title of Pantokrator, both the incredible power and the tedious micromanagement, this game is for you.

238960,Path of Exile,"[h1]A Detailed Look Into Path of Exile: Is it worth playing?[/h1]

[b]Short Answer[/b]: 

Yes. If you can get through the very steep learning curve, Path of Exile (PoE) is a phenomenal game. PoE is a true gem within the ARPG genre with an overwhelmingly intricate skill tree, gem combinations, wonderful 10 act story, vast and atmospheric world packed with lore. The game's complex nature, and continuous updates create an addictive and immersive experience, with seasons also resetting every few months to allow for new content.

[b]Long Answer[/b]:

Path of Exile stands as a true masterpiece within the action role-playing game (ARPG) genre, delivering an unrivalled depth of gameplay, a vast and intricate world, and a relentless pursuit of perfection by its dedicated development team at Grinding Gear Games. With its uncompromising complexity and endless possibilities, Path of Exile offers an addictive and rewarding experience that will captivate ARPG enthusiasts and challenge even the most seasoned players.

[h1][u]Skill Tree[/u][/h1]
One of the defining features of Path of Exile is its remarkable skill and character customisation system. The game offers a staggering skill tree, known as the Passive Skill Tree, that is a marvel of complexity and depth. With thousands of nodes to explore, players can create truly unique characters by meticulously planning their path and selecting the passive skills that suit their desired playstyle. This level of customisation ensures that no two characters are alike and opens up a world of strategic possibilities.

[h1][u]Unique Gem System[/u][/h1]
Path of Exile's skill gem system is another stroke of brilliance. Instead of using a traditional class system, players can socket active skill gems into their gear, allowing them to gain new abilities and modify their playstyle. This gem system, combined with the extensive support gem system that enhances and modifies active skills, provides an incredible level of versatility and experimentation. Whether you prefer to unleash devastating spells, wield massive weapons, or become a master of traps and minions, the possibilities are virtually limitless.

[h1][u]Player-Focused Economy[/u][/h1]
The game's economy is a complex web of trade and crafting, which further adds to the depth and immersion. Path of Exile features a barter-based system, where players trade items and currencies with each other. The currency items themselves have diverse uses, such as crafting or modifying gear, making the economy a dynamic and constantly evolving aspect of the game. This player-driven economy fosters a strong sense of community and encourages interaction and collaboration within the player base.

[h1][u]Story & Immersion[/u][/h1]
Path of Exile's dark and atmospheric world is teeming with lore and secrets. The game's gritty art style, detailed environments, and haunting soundtrack create an immersive experience that pulls you into its dark fantasy realm. The diverse locations, from sprawling cities to foreboding dungeons, are beautifully designed and provide a sense of exploration and discovery as you unravel the mysteries of the world.

[h1][u]Player Content[/u][/h1]
Grinding Gear Games has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to its player community. The development team consistently releases major expansions and updates that introduce new content, mechanics, and challenges. These expansions not only expand the game's storyline and lore but also introduce fresh gameplay experiences that keep the game feeling fresh and exciting. The dedication to improving the game based on player feedback is evident, with frequent balance adjustments and quality-of-life enhancements ensuring a continually evolving and engaging experience.

[h1][u]Multiplayer Aspects[/u][/h1]
The cooperative multiplayer aspect of Path of Exile is seamless and well-implemented. Players can team up with friends or join forces with others through the game's matchmaking system, allowing for exciting cooperative play and the sharing of strategies and loot. The endgame content, such as the challenging maps and intricate boss encounters, from unique map bosses, to pinnacle uber bosses like Maven & Shaper, provides a true test of skill and coordination for groups of adventurers.

If you're seeking an ARPG game that offers limitless possibilities, huge rewarding learning curves, and a captivating journey through a dark and treacherous world packed with lore, then Path of Exile is the game for you.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Disclaimer:   This review is to the game's current state in Alpha 0.2.0.3 when posting this.

As someone who loves city builder games, this one has a soft spot for me and am beginning to become addicted to it.  Currently on my 5th year of my village, I think its high time that I put in something as to why I am enjoying this game and to what I hope for in future patches.

First thing, I'll list everything I enjoy about this game.

The second you load into the game, I swear I thought I accidentally got on Kingdom Come.  The graphics is just as similar to that game which was pleasing to the eye.  I just love walking through the forests and along the rivers on this game.

The building aspect of the game is hands down easy to manage and interesting.  I will admit that took me a few starts until I got the hang of things but that is because I am the kind of player who goes in without reading any prior instructions, even if the tutorials and tool tips literally just saved it in my face.  The part that I enjoy the most is how each of the houses can be customized (with the proper materials and tech levels).  After my 3rd restart, I learned before you build the walls of homes, you can change them to be walls, doors, and windows.  No two houses has to look alike!

The music I could listen to it for hours, probably I am a huge geek for anything medieval.  First time I loaded the game I caught myself listening to the music for a good 20 minutes before I realized it was night time on the first day.

The fact the game works as a 'dynasty' is a unique charm to the game.  Even if you die of old age, you have a child successor that you basically 'respawn' to (granted if you married and had a child yet, otherwise game over).  This aspect has me wondering just how many years one can go.


Now for the Cons, which per say are more than bug issues than any other, since afterall this game is in Alpha when writing this.

Tools seem to bug out on me at times when, for instance, try to cut a tree.  I swing even though in range and it doesn't register the hit.  Face hug the tree and look down I can then hit the tree.  This happens once in a blue moon but it was still something that was happening to other tools like the hammer not hammering what you are building, or spears not registering hitting the animal.

Quests as much as I like doing them just to get away from the settlement building and management parts, I feel they are a bit repetitive.  I know there can be just so much you can do but still, I find the hunting quests to be the more annoying ones.  Not sure if the game bugs with them but when ever I get a hunting quest, I go to a common spot that I've seen X animal to do the quest, just to find them all gone.  I travel to other several locations to find barely anything.  Not sure if intended but do find it annoying.  Can say that of all the hunting quests I have done, I say I completed 2 out of over a dozen tries.

NPC spawning/rendering seems to be limited to how far you are from them.  An example is my main playthrough has my village east from Gostovia across the river.  I have a lumber yard little bit northwest and a hunting lodge straight north near a tiny pond.  Each night my villagers goes to the tavern to wind down and relax, but those who I set homes next to those work stations never come by.  Only when I venture out to them, they spawn in and THEN walk to the tavern.  I'd like to see that fixed that the games code at least has them walk around without having you having to be nearby to have them be 'interactive'.

Another npc problem is their pathing.  Have some get stuck on fences, buildings, trees, even each other.  I know its Alpha but just something to keep an eye out for to better improve the pathing AI.

Now this part is just some suggestions I would love to see added to the game.  Some here are stuff already planned but I just want to say how much I will love to finally see them added.

ROADS!  I NEED MY ROADS!  :D  I know this is coming soon but ROADS NAOW PLZ~

Signs:  Simple to add, just something to add more Roleplay like names to families or buildings.

Bigger map.  Nuff said.

Terrain editor:  Using the shovel to dig out the land a bit to level it out to build on.  There are so many great places to build that is restricted to the uneven terrain.  I'm a man who loves to build his villages in the mountains.

739630,Phasmophobia,"This game is extremely fun to play. Luckily my friends and I were looking for a co-op horror game right at this time and I stumbled upon this game. None of us regret it one bit. It's very promising for an early access game.

Pros -
While the game still has jumpscares, it doesn't rely on them very much at all, and instead relies on the natural tension of large, dark areas and the natural activity (or lack thereof) of the ghost in order to build suspense. This means, for me at least, the feeling of dread doesn't end up wearing off and I can still feel genuine fear when going on a new mission, even if I've been there 20 times before, while also letting those jumpscares still be somewhat scary. A win/win in my book.

The voice recognition is something I wasn't sure would work out to be very enjoyable, but boy was I wrong. It creates a great experience, actively speaking to the entity, trying to provoke it to show you what it can do, risking your life for the mission, but it's gotta be done. It's thrilling and fills you with dread. Having the mission react to the things you say is extremely immersive, one of this games biggest strengths.

Immersion as I said, is huge in this game. I always feel like I could actually be in the level. Especially if you are playing in VR, it's hard to be ripped out of the experience, even if you're fucking around with friends, like I was. Being able to be the one in the truck tracking movement and and activity throughout the location is just as thrilling as wandering the house itself looking for activity. It's been hilarious and immersive the several times my friend got impatient waiting for clues and went into the house to insult the ghost only for it to immediately lock the door and begin hunting him. 10/10

Cons - I don't really feel that it's entirely fair to list these as cons, as the game basically JUST came out as I write this, and I have very little to complain about and feel very positively about this game and it's future, but these are things to keep in mind, and that they may and will likely change in the future.

When playing in VR, you can hold a video camera in your hand and carry it around, and others can have a clear view of what you're pointing it at as you move through the house. I would like to see this also become a feature for desktop play, while you still can equip the camera and view it, the angle is very low and bobs sporadically, making things hard to see. You can buy a headmounted camera that I assume fixes this. I am not a high enough level to buy one yet so I'm not sure.

VR players definitely have an advantage in many scenarios as you can turn on equipment such as the EMF reader and the spirit box, then but them on your belt to use them hands-free. I would like for at least the EMF reader to do something similar, instead of turning off when you put it away. It makes a noise when you get a reading, and I think that could stay, while requiring you to pull it out again to see exactly how strong the reading is, I feel that would be a good compromise.

As for VR QOL, my only 2 concerns right now are 1. placing cameras. Currently you grip them by the left or right side in a set direction, and it's only different for each hand it's held in. It can make it difficult to place a camera facing a set direction. I would like to be able to grip cameras from a front angle, as well as from the top, in order to make placing them much easier. And 2. switching hands, currently you have to drop an item manually and catch it if you're fast, or pick it up off the floor in order to switch hands if you don't have room in your belt. Many other games allow you to grab object out of your other hand and I feel it would be very helpful. 

Mission design - Again, keep in mind that I'm writing this in very early access, so I expect this to change at some point. Currently, the only missions are identification. Go in, find clues, deduce the ghost type, leave. I Don't have a problem with map design, but I would like to see other mission types, such as full on removal, as the game talks about you, the identification team, doing the research for a future removal team, missions like that would be great. Another is finding out how the person died and became a ghost, the journal mentions a few times about death and people becoming a ghost. Finding clues about the death of the ghost would be a very interesting mission design and I'd love to see it come to light.

Sanity is also something I expect to become something much more than it is currently as the game goes on. I feel that is obvious but I will give my 2 cents anyway for complete transparency. Right now, with my current understanding, it doesn't matter until you hit 50% at which point the ghost becomes more aggressive against you. This on it's own is interesting and can be useful for drawing the ghost out, but I would like to see more, such as hallucinations, both visual and auditory. There's not much more I can say on this, anything I could is just as obvious as that so I won't bother, and again, expect changes to this.

Lastly, when you die, you become a ghost and wander the map as an invisible entity. I think this has a lot planned for the future, but currently that's all there is to it. I think it would be extremely interesting if you could interact with the world in a similar way to the spirit your team is still hunting. Things like flicking the lights, writing short phrases on walls, or maybe being able to speak in a ghostly filter for just a couple seconds to give them a clue, would be very fun and make it so you're not just a passive and clueless observer if you are killed. If done in a way where it isn't always clear if the interaction is between the hostile spirit or your fallen friend, it would be possibly the most unique thing I've ever seen in a co-op horror game.

All in all, this game is a steal at it's current $15 price, and I got it on sale for less than $13! Even if you want to wait to play it when it's more developed, pick it up now! I have no issues recommending this to anyone, and I anticipate a very bright future in those dark corridors.

1151340,Fallout 76,I may or may not have Stockholm syndrome,may may stockholm syndrome
1151340,Fallout 76,"In 2018, they tried to sell Fallout fans a hardcore multiplayer survival experience, a lonely desolate world full of horrifying creatures and insane griefers launching nukes at your head. Now, in 2021, they have turned it into post-apocalyptic Animal Crossing. It's a game about socializing, building your camp, running a store, crafting cooler stuff, collecting rare junk/outfits for your museum, and occasionally fighting an enormous, pregnant, mutant bat. I feel like if Bethesda could do a better job promoting what the game has become, they would attract more new players.

As a lifelong Fallout fan, and a single-player RPG gamer in general, I never wanted other random people running around in my wasteland. I tried to shut them out and play the game as a solo experience until a random high level player stumbled on me building my camp, flagged me down, and basically forced me to take some cool new building plans. When I tried to launch my first nuke solo, a lvl. 400 player followed me into the silo and helped me complete the quest with nothing more than thumbs-up emotes shared between us.  Visiting other random camps and shelters, and just seeing the creativity of the community has become one of my favorite pastimes.

As a Fallout game, it now ranks among my favorites, but it's a bit of a mixed bag and YMMV. The story content that is clearly pre-Wastelanders patch is [b]so good[/b]. It reminds me a lot of Fallout 1 in tone. It's more serious and personal, and all told through long holotapes, extremely dense terminal entries, and environmental clues. The NPC quests from Wastelanders on are a bit more varied in quality. I really liked some and didn't care so much for others, but I appreciate the attempt at making them more dynamic like old Fallout and less [i]go here kill thing loot stuff[/i] quests like in Fallout 4. However, the ""live-service"" aspect of it all means that a lot of the story content is ""coming in the future"" and feels unfinished or left on a cliffhanger.`

The combat feels a little underdeveloped and broken, which is nothing new for a Fallout game so I am not particularly bothered by it. I like where they've landed with the survival elements. It's cool that eating, drinking, resting, and diseases all matter in the Wasteland now, but you aren't really punished for ignoring them if you want to. The monetization sucks and the stuff is way overpriced, but that's just old man yelling at cloud talk. Those things aren't going away from gaming any time soon.

If you love Fallout or if you want to build a house and hang out in the wasteland, you will probably find something to love about this game.

294100,RimWorld,"I've played RimWorld for [i]easily[/i] over 1000 hours aside from the 160+ hours on record for my account, I really should have reviewed it sooner since I've played it so long, but I never got around to it, so this'll include my experience in the game, what's good and bad, and everything you'd likely need to know before getting it.

To jump to my [b]conclusion:[/b] This game is fantastic if you like build a colony from the ground up, it's very interactive and you'll always have something to do, be it planning a new room for your base, building up defenses, creating a more reliable food source or even raiding enemy factions. At first it's very daunting as there is a lot to get used to, but each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the game, your story is always your own and it'll never be the same as before, lending this game to nigh-infinite replayability, and that's not even considering mods which are abundant, relatively easy to make yourself and very active. The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passes, even your own ideas may be implemented if they're good additions to the game. The community is one of the best I've seen, where people joke around, share their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time. I recommend this game if you like strategy, tackling positive/negative turn of events, planning things, and sandbox style survival games. If you're still on the fence for buying the game, watch a 'lets play' video and see madness that can occur, check out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilities, it really is a great game.

[b]Art 8/10:[/b] The art style is quite minimalistic, at first it may be a turn-off but the style works well with the gameplay, with the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen it's good that the textures aren't complex, as it'd strain your eyes, whereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesn't impede the gameplay, things represent what they're meant to be, and it's surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphics.

[b]Story 10/10:[/b] This game is both heart breaking and hilarious, there is no set story, so things can go in any direction, you could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurs, causing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your base, after which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skin, maybe for that human leather hat you've always wanted. Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol. Story is incredibly well done in this game, and with how fun it can be I'm surprised lots of other games don't use the same style.

[b]Sound 6/10:[/b] The sound is basic like the art, the sounds work for their intended purposes, there's nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything unique, the sound it has is right, but it's not something the game is well known for and isn't made to contribute a lot to the game.

[b]Gameplay 8/10:[/b] There are different types of games so I'll elaborate, for the style of game this is (a sci-fi colony sim) I'd say the gameplay is near perfect, and it can be perfected to a player's liking with mods, a lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base game's gameplay will get even better over time. Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screen, and your colonists with build them if they have the resources, they can get the resources from your setting up of work orders (like cutting down trees, mining rocks, butchering animals, harvesting plants and various other ways). It's almost like you're the architect of a colony, telling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be done, it's quite nice as luck is a big factor, but foresight allows you to somewhat control your luck, and mitigate disaster, there's little that's more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plan.

[b]Mods 9/10:[/b] Mods are very good for this game, some change the game entirely (like changing the space-cowboy style theme to that of Lord of the Rings, Medieval, WW2 era and many others), whilst others change / add to the games features and tools, allowing for you to adjust anything you don't like into something you do like, and the modding community is quite active, if there's a good idea for a mod then it's likely already made, If you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods first, as whilst they add a lot to the game, they also take away from the main theme, playing it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quicker.

[b]Overall 9/10:[/b] The features individually would make the game an 8.2/10, but how they come together makes it a 9/10 for me, since RimWorld is the best game of it's type, I've looked long and hard for other games like it, and Prison Architect is the only game similar, but to me it doesn't have the random glory that RimWorld has. RimWorld is certainly worth £30, hell it's worth £50+ to me since I've got so much entertainment out of it, other games you may play for 200, maybe 300 hours, but this is one of those games which you can sink months into, and games like that are worth buying.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"Greetings from Bulgaria! I am Vulkk (or Alex) and I have been playing SWTOR since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs. I would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review below, while still being honest about the flaws of the game in its ""elderly age"".

Star Wars: The Old Republic is now nine years old at the time of this publication. The game has an incredible amount of content to offer to a new player. The learning curve is not too steep and the stories are all free to enjoy them at your own pace.

All the way up to level 60 is currently available 100% free of charge. You can play all 8 origin class stories to level 50, and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60.

If you enjoy playing casually, you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account. However, once you approach the EndGame, you start feeling the limitations of the F2P model very hard. Once you find out what it is like to play as a Subscriber, you may struggle to get back to Preferred status player (the middle limitation level) after your Sub expires.

SWTOR offers tons of solo content, but it shines in the group play, especially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available. Be it casual or hardcore, raiding, PvPing, exploration, Conquest - everything is more fun with friends in this game. Play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into them, then join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the EndGame grind.

Being a nine years old game, SWTOR struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard-core fans and veterans of the game. I myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single  update, change, bright moments and failures over the years. It's a thing to consider, but if you are reading this review, you are probably wondering if it's worth picking up the game. Yes, absolutely.

The game engine is a giant issue from the very beginning. Low FPS in group environment such as Operations and Warzones may be frequent and the graphics of the game in the old content really shows how long it's been since SWTOR's release.

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"There's two directions I can take this review. One is ""I recommend, but ..."" and the other is ""I don't recommend, however ..."", and they're both probably going to say the same things. Strap in, and grab a cup of hot chocolate, daddy's gonna tell stories again:

If I compare my experience playing the first game on release to this one on release, this one is much, much better. But how?

The original Cities: Skylines was a relief from the crushed dreams of SimCity fans. It came in as the rightful conqueror of the city building genre, and built a huge community of gamers, designers and modders that have influenced the growth of the game since. It refined the SimCity style beyond expectations, it broke the gridded city building style, it introduced gamers to urban design and planning ideas that they have never thought of before, and a whole sub-genre of urbanist YouTubers rose up from this. However, when you compare the two vanilla games, without the mods and DLC and hundred of YouTube content creators, the first game is great, but a bit empty. It didn't start with a day-night cycle, that was added in After Dark. It didn't start with many of the best transit options, they came in later DLCs. Inland water treatment plants didn't exist until 2020 with Sunset Harbor.

Cities: Skylines 2 starts with everything that the base game should have. It doesn't only have a day-night cycle, it has seasons. It doesn't just have different zoning densities, it has mixed use zones. You don't just place down industry building and print money, the game has a diversified economy, hearkening back to SimCity2000 when you could individually manage tax rates for different industries, but here you can do that to the entire economy. You can encourage and develop an economy based on retail and services, or primary industries, or manufacturing of any kind. You don't just have buses, trains and planes, you have the option to use taxis, buses, trains, trams, subway metros, planes and boats to transport your people and cargo outside cars and trucks. To build the city you don't just lay down roads, you can plan curves and bends and intersections using the various feedback that it gives you, create clean interchanges and intersections, and use a variety of tools to limit turns and eliminate traffic conflicts. You can even obverse traffic accidents affect your roads and disasters affect the city, pollution affecting the environment and a myriad other things that you didn't even think of when the original was released in 2015.

Compared to that, yeah, no questions.

So why is everyone saying ""Yes, but ...""?

I won't repeat it in detail, you've already read the other reviews. Basically, expectations for the game's performance and delivery were misaligned between the developers, the publishers and the consumers. Performance issues were a huge problem right off the bat because most people do not have systems that meet the requirements of the game, but the developers have been tasked with making the game suitable for console. Misaligned expectations. The game's economic system was too opaque to clearly understand what was going on, to the point that unsubstantiated rumours began spreading that the economy was fake (it's not). Feedback to the user was not adequate to completely understand what was going on, and many players assumed things were bugs when they were not. Misaligned expectations.

However, the performance issues and opaque UI feedback aside, none of this was helped by the myriad of bugs that have since seen six major patches to clean up, with more work to come out after the Christmas holidays.

Finally, to nail the point home about misaligned expectations: content. I came in to the original game in March 2015, right on release. I was with it the whole way through. I was there when the beacons were lit and Gondor called for aid. I didn't even bother using mods until 2019, because that's when they were interesting and mature enough to really make a difference in the game. By the time the Great Plague of 2020 hit, the original was primed to receive huge interest in the game. Content on the workshop exploded. YouTubers exploded. Everything exploded. It was wild! So when, in early 2023, the new game was announced, a host of gamers came in with huge content expectations and none of the context. YouTubers speculated on the most insane speculations, people were having meltdowns about the new engine staying on Unity instead of hopping over to Unreal Engine. Wild.

And so on release, despite having literally been released with more tools and content than city builders have ever had, with all of the good ideas from everywhere in the broader community being incorporated into the base game, the chief criticism was a lack of content. The game felt empty. Grey (UK)! Gray (US)! Graey (WTF)! Critiques went from blasting CS1 for being too cartoony to blasting CS2 for being too realistic with its browns and concretes. At this point, I stopped listening to shameless and pointless, often contradictory criticism and looked for genuine concerns.

These are easy to list:
- the game is still in need of more performance fixes
- the game's UI needs more obvious indicators of what's going on with underlying systems
- the game is a resource H-O-G
- tools still feel a bit unrefined
- there are missing options that would make things so much nicer (props, prop tools, decorative tools, etc)
- no mods at the moment, we want mods
- no editors, no map editor, no asset editor, none of that yet
- console version still needs to be released
- the bug issues have delayed the Ultimate Edition's Q4 and Q1 DLC releases
- there are still some major bugs that require further investigation

To be frank, though, my stance is straightforward: bugs can be fixed, and these issues will be ironed out over time. The devs have repeatedly shown that they intend to see this through.

So yes, ""I recommend, but ..."", be mindful of the things that are still to be fixed, and you may enjoy the game. ""I don't recommend, however ..."", set your expectations appropriately and you will realise this game has enormous potential to be the definitive game of the city simulation genre. The first game rightfully conquered the crown.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","I have 4000+ hours between the previous two Vermintide games. I hardly respect my own time, I'm not going to mind the grind because I clearly have a pathological condition. As of now with only four classes in the game, you will need to spend a bare, flawless, no-losses, no afk time, 120 hour minimum to even get them all to max level so you can actually fully experience them as designed. This is not the only pain point, but it is an important place to begin when exploring the downsides of Fatshark products, which hopefully other reviewers will touch on in greater depth.

I've spent about 8 years with this company's products and organizing communities for them, hearing all the feedback, and recognizing all the development patterns along the way. Disrespect of your time, the 4 measly hours of relaxation you have after a days work, is by now surely ingrained into their design philosophy. Expect to skim about 15-20% of the potential of the game before most people would burn out or move onto something that feels more rewarding.

That being said, you are sure to love the gameplay. But note that nearly every other supporting system (UI, UX, loot acquisition and build tinkering) is not transparent enough for players to make informed and meaningful decisions, or requires a level of time investment that simply won't be accessible for the vast majority of people. I believe that for many, many people, the reality of this being an ""engagement product"" rather than just a reliably joyful and rewarding ""game"" will be very tangible.

If you, like me, have something terribly wrong with you, you'll probably be fine with all of this. If you are anybody with a modicum of self-respect, beware.

*Release Update* - UI for weapons now have rather detailed stats. It cannot be overstated how much of a leap this is when considering Fatshark's history on providing deeper insight into how mechanics operate, and just what numbers you can expect from interactions.

1336490,Against the Storm,"There's a terrible truth at the heart of the city-building genre. Success is usually aesthetically satisfying, but mechanically dull. There are people who play city-building games just to create intricate and beautiful cities. These are people of vision and self-motivation, who see the blank canvas of a wilderness and a set of tools and get to work creating something living, breathing and vibrant. This is usually the rewarding end-state of most city-builders. You struggle to get your people established at first, but once you've desperately climbed your way out of a few starvation death spirals or economic collapses, you stand atop a monument to your own successes - ready to carve out the final flourishes in precisely the way you see fit. What a glorious exercise in self-expression! Hoorah, what a good mayor are you!

This game is not for that.

This game comes to you here, standing in the forum of your shining city on the hill. It whispers an undeniable secret. Some sick part of you still feels the blood-hunger. It lurks, leering from the shadows. Yes, this city is grand... but it's... finished. The game is over. This is pointless now. Where are the coughing masses, barely holding on through a worsening winter? Where are the clunking gears that grind to a halt as a well of resources dries up, demanding a deft redraw of your entire production chain, lest you fall into a bottomless hell of unmet needs?

Yes, you could torch the city yourself. Make a challenge of it. But you would know what you were taking apart... and so you would know how to put it back together. No, what you need is a thankless puzzle... one that hates your success, spits on you and demands more. One that laughs at your failure for just a moment, before cutting you down with merciful swiftness and offering you to try again, but this time - do it better.

Against the Storm is this whisperer. Using the loose shape of a rogue-light, Eremite Games have pieced together a marvellous puzzle that never stops demanding more of you. It bottles that delicious lightning that is the first, teetering half of any other city-builder, and delivers it over and over again.

Key to its success is a distinct puzzle-like approach. Resources can be reassigned to respond to new threats with minimum fuss. Commands are executed near-instantly, provided you have the labour to enact them. Striking out into new territory will produce unknown results, but you're given plenty of hints that narrow the pool of potential outcomes. Decisions about when to get yourself into more trouble are largely your own, but the timer is always ticking, so the risk calculation is one you must make yourself. The city doesn't really have a cultural life of it's own, there's no real space to make stories for your settlement, but the challenge keeps its bootheel on your neck, daring you to push the difficulty up just a little higher and see if you can make it out the other side. 

This is all to say, it's expertly crafted city-building crack. All killer, no filler. It's not without its rhythm, and so I could see someone finding their chill in this game, but for me, it's a total attention hole. Each game has me wondering if I'll be able to pull it off, and then the elation comes as the economic gears click into place and I cinch the win. Then, without missing a beat, the game throws up a victory screen and says ""onto the next one?""

My answer continues to be yes, much to the downfall of my sleep cycle.

As a final note, this is basically Forest-Nothing if the forest hated you, and the so the forest was your primary opponent. If that sounds like your jam, you should stop reading and start playing.",terrible truth heart city building genre success usually aesthetically satisfying mechanically dull people play city building game create intricate beautiful city people vision self motivation see blank canvas wilderness set tool get work creating something living breathing vibrant usually rewarding end state city builder struggle get people established first desperately climbed way starvation death spiral economic collapse stand atop monument success ready carve final flourish precisely way see fit glorious exercise self expression hoorah good mayor game game come standing forum shining city hill whisper undeniable secret sick part still feel blood hunger lurks leering shadow yes city grand finished game pointless coughing mass barely holding worsening winter clunking gear grind halt well resource dry demanding deft redraw entire production chain lest fall bottomless hell unmet need yes could torch city make challenge would know taking apart would know put back together need thankless puzzle one hate success spit demand one laugh failure moment cutting merciful swiftness offering try time better storm whisperer using loose shape rogue light eremite game pieced together marvellous puzzle never stop demanding bottle delicious lightning first teetering half city builder delivers key success distinct puzzle like approach resource reassigned respond new threat minimum fuss command executed near instantly provided labour enact striking new territory produce unknown result given plenty hint narrow pool potential outcome decision get trouble largely timer always ticking risk calculation one must make city really cultural life real space make story settlement challenge keep bootheel neck daring push difficulty little higher see make side say expertly crafted city building crack killer filler without rhythm could see someone finding chill game total attention hole game wondering able pull elation come economic gear click place cinch win without missing beat game throw victory screen say onto next one answer continues yes much downfall sleep cycle final note basically forest nothing forest hated forest primary opponent sound like jam stop reading start playing

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","Here's the thing, I love this game, I think it's an awesome game. But I cannot recommend it for the moment because game breaking bugs are FREQUENT and BAD. They are doing a good job of patching but without the Toybox mod I would have encountered completely game breaking bugs in both chapter 2 and 3, and several companion events could not be completed due to game breaking bugs that prevent progress.

I am currently dead stopped in chapter 4 as I have enountered,  yet another game breaking bug, but Toybox can't fix it as it's a quest progress issue. Every time I try to launch the last remaining quest in my log I instead am treated to a replay of the very first event that happens in chapter 4, I'm then dumped into the captains quarters with no progress, I can go back out to space, try again, happens again. 

Validating files doesn't fix it, reloading from an earlier save doesn't fix it, leaving the system and coming back doesn't fix it, relaunching the game doesn't fix it, reinstall doesn't fix it, nothing I can conceivably do has fixed the issue.

270880,American Truck Simulator,"This is the first time I've ever left a review on Steam, but I had to.

Let me preface this by stating I am a CDL instructor.

While the game can't mimic certain real life situations, the amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive. I have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the life, but firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noises, the turn indicator, the traffic, the air brakes, all of it takes me back.

I'm not going to sit here and nitpick out everything it didn't quite get right, like how if you try to GTA it, you have increasing fines but IRL you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol. I'd rather focus on what it DID get right.

Speaking of fines, the way they increase really makes it so if you do try to GTA it, you'll eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load. Making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe driving. 
 I purposely tried three profiles up to about level 20 each. I drove like a bat out of hell on the first as a gag, quasi crazy the second one, and perfectly safe the third time. I noticed that I made more profit with fewer deliveries by driving safe. So while the game can't take away your CDL for constantly running red lights and scraping the side of a car, the fact you just simply can't make a profit unless you drive safe was a nifty implementation.

I could go on and on about this game and the nostalgia for the open road it gives me, but I'd rather be playing it right now. I tried the demo, immediately pulled in, bought it on sale, and once I really experienced it, I didn't even question buying all the available DLC and now anxiously awaiting the new states.

Quick mention about Wyoming and Texas:
I'm going to enjoy driving Wyoming in this game as driving it in real life was an absolute headache with how often I-80 has chain ups for ice and shut downs just for strong winds that could blow your trailer clean over. So that's a reason I'm GLAD it's not 100% realistic. 

For Texas, make sure you put the entirety of Dallas under construction....forever. Make sure no one ever uses a blinker. And make sure any shippers in Laredo have trailer yards so small that even the most skilled driver/gamer can't park a damn thing in it because they just simply can't move. 

.....I hated Laredo loads. Can't you tell?

I will be constantly throwing my money at this game. I hope this goes far. I hope the devs never lose their passion for it. I hope it stays alive long enough to see the entire continental 48. Hell, I hope -I- stay alive long enough to see that lol. I would love to hop I-40 from Barstow clear to Wilmington, NC. Or I-10 from Cali to Florida. 

I can't say enough good things and most have tuned me out by now so I'll wrap up.

Base game feels like the perfect mix between a modern shooter and classic halo, a winning formula in most developers's hands. 343 However, have repeatedly dropped the ball with their ""Live service"" with no service.
To add to this, every patch that is released to fix crashes or bugs end up breaking a different part of the game.
For instance: today season 2 ""Lone Wolves"" released, my very first challenge was to complete a game of oddball. I have no choice to search for oddball matches, so I hit ""Quick Play""
2,5 hours later - Not ONE oddball match, so I start leaving to see if oddball is even in the rotation.
after doing this a couple of times my account is now Temp banned.
After returning, first match I join, the game crashes... and I am again Temp Banned.

1599340,Lost Ark,"Lobby/Gatekeeping Simulator. 

Rushing content to catch up to Korea was such a great idea. Look at the player base from when the game was released to now. Support drought, gatekeeping, the toxic environment, the works. If you plan on starting this game now, don't. Endgame has become a circle jerk of the 1%, competing for MVP status and who has the shinier weapon. Unless you're friends with one of these guys, do not expect to get accepted anywhere. 

This is coming from a solo player (no static or interaction with guilds) that's spent a fair chunk of time and ended up with above-average gear. I'm not entirely ""juiced"" but I can guarantee I'll get into lobbies faster than 90% of players. However, even with the gear that I have, I can still get gate-kept. Only because I haven't spent thousands of dollars to over-gear beyond the requirements for raids, so that they become a mindless damage-dumping fight to skip mechanics. 

Raiding used to be a fun experience at first but it's become a repulsive environment just to get raids done ""fast"" and move onto the next alt. I'm not feeling burnout, I'm just not as motivated as I used to be when I started.

Server merges will not fix anything. Side content has become a joke. This game will literally have to become your part-time job. It will only get worse if Amazon/SGS doesn't do anything about it. Unfortunately this review will just get buried among the other reviews, maybe even along with the game eventually. Life expectancy for Lost Ark; no longer than a year. 

Turn around and don't look back.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the [b] most horrific title ever released. [/b] This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

[h3] Player Flexibility: [/h3]
With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!). 

[h3] Player Movement: [/h3]
Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

[h3] Predatory Marketing: [/h3]
For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players).

216150,MapleStory,"I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle. 

I miss you Maplestory.

1336490,Against the Storm,"This game is phenomenal.  Writing after 50 hours and clearing the first two ""bosses"" (forging seals).  I played on one higher level than the recommended difficulty for all sessions.  A brilliant marriage of roguelite and RPG elements into a city builder that feels like it shouldn't work and yet does.

The major innovation of this game, in my opinion, is that it solves the ""late game boredom"" problem endemic to so many strategy and build games.  I have often quit a builder like Factorio/Anno or a 4x game like Civilization after the initial expansion phase is over, usually because I can tell I am going to win and have long slog before the game acknowledges this, or managing my creation becomes a chore.  Often times the initial excitement of your town/civilization operating under conditions of scarcity and adaptation based on your starting conditions wears off as you expand, build more, unlock tech, and solve all the resource problems in a boring late game.  

This has never happened with AtS.  In fact, amazingly, I would say the later your town goes, the more exciting it becomes, and the a particular game ""run"" ends before it becomes overwhelming.  I think this is something very unique to this game.

The game uses its roguelike mechanics to force you into choosing blueprints, population, resource gathering priorities and more to try to best match the conditions you find yourself in, but you cannot ""unlock the whole tech tree"" and will run out of both time and resources, and so eventually your ""build"" for your town either comes together or it doesn't.  You are often forced between competing long and short term priorities.  Eventually, there is enjoyable pressure to reach the victory condition before things collapse under their own weight, such as your population's fuel and food consumption outstripping the resources left or your ability to keep people happy under increasingly harsh conditions.  

The late game of a ""run"" (a single town build) is a dash to the finish, but not in a stressful way - it was unbelievably satisfying as the last little piece I needed for my town's ""build"" to align clicked into place and the fully realized machine sprung to life to propel me to victory.  This is a game where it really makes you feel clever, and when things don't work I have never felt frustrated but instead obsess in the shower about how the puzzle could have been solved.  And then you get to do it again under different conditions, with meta progression and a surprisingly intriguing and unique setting.

The only feedback I'd give to the dev on something that could be improved would be to force more varied conditions on the player earlier if they choose higher difficulties.  The starting biome (and the strategies that work for it) serve as a bit of a tutorial but I was craving more variety I think a little sooner than the game wanted to give it to me.

I'd recommend this game to anyone, but especially those who are fans of any of the genres involved, and especially to those who love the idea of the machine of strategy games / builder games but have trouble staying committed until the end of them.  I think you will find this one scratches that itch and more.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"This is the single best game I have ever played in my life and i've been gaming since the 80s. Ninja Theory used Cambridge Professors of mental health and actual people with mental health issues to make this as real as they could. Senua sufers from psychosis. She hears voices, sees patterns and numbers in the world around her. 

  I have never been big on puzzle and story games. What if I didn't ilke the story? I wasted my money. The ""puzzles"" in this game don't really feel like puzzles... the ""story"" is amazing... the fighting sequences are awesome! There is a great balance of all of these things in the game. It's not all ""puzzles"" not all fighting and not all story. Beautifully balanced.

  The voices... oh man.. the voices make the buildup insane! And when they aren't there for brief moments, you actually feel alone. If your thinking ""i don't want to buy a game that only has 10 hours of play time"" (or whatever) I am with you on that! I never puchase a game that I see low hours on, but this is not a full priced 60 dollar game, but you the get triple A title treatment. 

   This game is absolutely gorgeous. I am still running a 970 for a graphics card and I can play at full settings and its beautiful. I don't know how they pulled it off.. optimization? This just goes to show you how poorly optimized other games are. 

   YOU MUST USE HEADPHONES or a really good surround sound. Very few games have ever made me actually turn my head while playing when I hear something. For the best use simulated our actual surround sound headphones. 

  My final take? Let me tell you about myself so this might actually means something. I am a Marine Corps combat Veteran. I own and operate my own dump trucking business. I am a ""hard"" man. This game had me balling and blubbering at the end. I was yelling at my screen ""I WIL NOT GIVE UP, NO, I WILL NOT GIVE UP!!!!"" I have felt ""feelings"" about this game for days after beating it. I have changed my destop background. I have played through 1.75 times (had to format PC) and I will play through again for sure!

  I highly encourage you to research this game before you play. Understand the background because it will make you FEEL so much more. 

  I simply cannot put into words how this game takes you into the world of psychosis, mental illness, and at the same time give you a great story about a small clan that was conquered by Vikings,, aka ""The Northman"" and one persons fight against her own demons in her head.

  Hellblade gets 5 thumbs up from me. Best game I have ever played in my life, yes I know, I said that already and I MEAN IT.

281990,Stellaris,"I started off as a bird species on the far edge of the galaxy. Their average lifespan was around 60 years, but they made every year count. They were obsessed with technology, already building their first robots before they had even left their world. Unfortunately, they were immediately boxed in by empires that had emerged into FTL travel far before they had. 

Their dreams of expanding into distant worlds was immediately and brutally crushed, after their first colony was bombarded into oblivion during in an ill-fated first-contact. Instead of expanding into planets, my people instead built habitats around dead worlds, watching with envious eyes as their hyper-religious neighbours claimed lush, verdant planets. 

They waiting, watching their old sicken and die, wracked by disease and genetic weakness, while the incredibly long-lived religious neighbours often made it to ages such as 110. Their neigbours scoffed, those Emperors of the Divine. They knew those foolishly materialistic birds could not possibly understand their true purpose in the unvierse. God was on the side of those who hated materialists, after all. 

Humiliation after humilitation followed, where my people were used in foreign wars, had their new colonies taken away from them, brave colonists literally eaten as delicacies in certain worlds. The bird's hearts gradually hardened, and they began to view aliens with the contempt they so richly deserved. 

The hatred grew, and the people grew stronger from it. One day, a neighbouring empire, a race of disgusting fungoids, had their fleet annihilated in a short-lived war with an impossibly-powerful ancient empire. Quickly taking advantage of their weakened status, my people quickly turned them into tributaries. The bounty of materials allowed a new phase of expansion for my people, and we colonized 3 new planets. 

Suddenly, they had become a Great Power in their local area. The religious kings nearby, now the undisputed superpower of the galaxy, continued to ignore them. After all, they were but a gnat in comparison to the territorial holdings of the great Empire. They were soon proven wrong, as in a few short years a massive construction of habitats was implemented across my people's nation. Billions of souls now rested in space, enough to even match the population and might of the Divine Empire. 

My people continued to advance, their knowledge of cybernetics second to none. Soon, they had a breakthrough: implants could increase their efficiency to the point where they would become the superpower. After a brief teething period, it was done. Every man, woman and child was equipped with the implants. The Divine Empire was horrified, quickly declaring an unprovoked war. But this was not the same bird people as before. 

Now, their vengeance was at hand. They crushed the forces of the False Emperor, casting him down, and taking his holdings for themselves. The long-lived creatures were quickly enslaved, forced to watch their once great empire collpasing into feuding chiefdoms. Soon, the bird race began to challenge even the ancient empires, building Ringworlds, Dyson Spheres, and even an sensory array that let them see the entire galaxy. Furthermore, they discovered a way to store their minds into an immortal body of steel. 

This would not stand, the ancient empires decided, immediately declaring war on the innocent birds. Once again, they were quickly crushed, thousand-year old empires grinded into the dust of history. Now, there were only the birds, mechanical gods of the galaxy, encased in empty, undying shells. Every other race was dead, killed in revenge for their cruelty, and their arrogance. A foreign invader came, a biological hivemind from another galaxy. They too, were quickly crushed, and their worlds burned into ashes. 

The gods built a ringworld at the centre of the galaxy, to remind those fledgling races, just coming into space travel, of the folly of those who came before, then retreated back the edge of the galaxy, content to explore the mysteries of the universe within their massive ringworlds. Time would only tell if the newer races will make the same mistake.

"489830,1746860",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition,"Game was and still is so cool, but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.
I usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.
Mods i use:
- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game
- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents
- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.
- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster
-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing.
-  Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.
- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.
- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D
- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.
- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.
- Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.
- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.
- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff
- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.
- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)
- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.
- When vampires attack: Same with vampires
- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. 
- Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.
- Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.
- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"".
- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.
- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.
- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.
- NPC's Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.
- Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...
- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)
- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.
- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.
- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!
- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul
- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.
- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.
- Verdant: Better textures for grass.
- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.
- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.
- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)
- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)
BTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly

Some of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? 
There are two options, wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list, but it will be there, so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).

EDIT: I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called: Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE, and i found it on nexusmods. Short description: you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish, like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city, setting primary spells, weapons, THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4340/?

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Patch 7.2 released 5/20/20 has effectively KILLED this game.  A short sighted money grab by the devs has conspired to inject loads of BOTS into virtually all BR game types (ranked squads being the exception).  With this move, the very core of what made PUBG's gameplay special has now been eviscerated.  Getting a kill or a win used to be difficult and in turn rewarding.  Now you can hop into a vehicle and proceed to run down enemy AI with impunity.  They've also made terrible changes to the circle,  all but eliminating any intermission between circles, making it a running match from start to end.  I've always felt that the dev team had a certain amount of contempt for it's player base, but this move confirms my suspicions .  As of today, the NA player base has dwindled down to 230K avg concurrent users.  Expect that number to drop by at least  50% within the coming months..  It's sad for me because this was my favorite game. I can now safely attest that this game is in it's death rattle.  Save your money and look for the next best thing coming.",patch 7 2 released 5 20 20 effectively killed game short sighted money grab devs conspired inject load bot virtually br game type ranked squad exception move core made pubg gameplay special eviscerated getting kill win used difficult turn rewarding hop vehicle proceed run enemy ai impunity also made terrible change circle eliminating intermission circle making running match start end always felt dev team certain amount contempt player base move confirms suspicion today na player base dwindled 230k avg concurrent user expect number drop least 50 within coming month sad favorite game safely attest game death rattle save money look next best thing coming
1336490,Against the Storm,"Cozy style and atmosphere (despite the apocalypse!). Fantastic user interface (& readability in general). Sound design is pleasant and informative. There is a certain charm to this game that is hard to pinpoint for me - it just feels comfy. Early Access but absolutely already a game worth paying for and playing. Try out the demo!

There are so many randomised elements that you are forced to adapt with whatever you have access to. As a result each run feels very engaging and reactive.
[list]
[*]workers, starting resources, blueprints, discoverable resources, glade events, cornerstones, perks, orders, trader offerings, world map modifiers, etc...
[/list]
There are so many moving parts to manage with each new settlement that there really isn't a brute force way to win a game - one must adapt.

I really, really like the UI in this game. It feels so well polished already and improvements keep coming.

The devs are currently updating the game every 2 weeks. Constantly changing and improving the game at such a rate that I hesitate to criticise certain aspects because many of my previous gripes have already been addressed!

Eremite Games - you guys have done a fantastic job already and I am excited to see how things develop from here. The consistent patches with detailed patch notes are the cherry on top for me. You guys rock - thank you!

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"Bear in mind as you read this review that I am awful at and usually dislike playing online competitive fps games. 

Okay.

Hunt: Showdown has the absolute crunchiest shooting mechanics I have ever encountered in a video game and I LOVE it.  You feel both the power and the profound limitations of the gun in your hands. It handles with weight, it reloads realistically, and being able to see a representation of each round chambering and firing in the corner of your screen makes it even better.  

Combined with the fantastic gamefeel of the shooting, Hunt offers an ingeniously constructed multiplayer that makes you nervous to even squeeze off a single shot for fear of being heard by the competition... but then you round a corner and come face to face with a hulking abomination so surprised to see you that it births a leech onto the floor in real time, and you're forced to fan your hammer and pray there isn't anyone around to hunt YOU.

I can seldom outshoot my fellow Hunters, but this game also allows me to out-sneak and out-think, leaping out of a second floor window to bury my axe in the back of a tophat-adorned head, or tossing a lit lantern (found in the world) around a corner to wreathe a hallway where my rivals are waiting in flame.

Hunt: Showdown is a truly cool and creative addition to the competitive FPS space, and I really think more people should be playing it. It puts a fresh spin on nearly every known mechanic present in the game, from health to guns to loadout assembly, and might just restore your faith in multiplayer first person shooting if you've found it waning in recent years.",bear mind read review awful usually dislike playing online competitive fps game okay hunt showdown absolute crunchiest shooting mechanic ever encountered video game love feel power profound limitation gun hand handle weight reloads realistically able see representation round chambering firing corner screen make even better combined fantastic gamefeel shooting hunt offer ingeniously constructed multiplayer make nervous even squeeze single shot fear heard competition round corner come face face hulking abomination surprised see birth leech onto floor real time forced fan hammer pray anyone around hunt seldom outshoot fellow hunter game also allows sneak think leaping second floor window bury axe back tophat adorned head tossing lit lantern found world around corner wreathe hallway rival waiting flame hunt showdown truly cool creative addition competitive fps space really think people playing put fresh spin nearly every known mechanic present game health gun loadout assembly might restore faith multiplayer first person shooting found waning recent year
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Okay for starters, at this moment I have played for a total of 60 days, and have been playing for about a year total. I start playing with friends on the Crystal data center in North America, and plat on “Goblin” 

A Realm Reborn currently is a stretch to get through and can be tough for new players to enjoy but there is a patch (5.3 a major patch to the game) coming in soon which will make ARR way better to go through 

The Pros 

-Playable on Mac, PC, and PS4 (PS3 is discontinued I believe)

-It's fun with friends

-Tons of hours to pour in of content

-Variety of customization for races

-hairstyles can be changed later on don’t worry

-Different classes of Healers, DPS, or a Tank

-Once you hit level 15 and complete a certain main quest you can pick up a different class if you dislike your starter class

-If you never want to see or be queued with someone you can black list them

-If you want to start a “guild” aka a Free company or FC for short you can! 

-DLCs When a new one comes out you can buy it and it will give you the previous ones!

Cons

-The first story will feel long but it will get better

-Some salty and toxic players

-Role Play players ruining your fun in a dungeon (doesn't happen often don’t worry)

Races 
-Hyur - Human

-Elezen - Elf

-Lalafell - midgets (adults but some roleplay as lolis)

-Miqo’te - Cat girls (or boys)
-shortest for male (not too sure) and second shorted for female (besides Lalafells)

-Roegadyn - are basically Giants or shriek as I call them

-Au Ra - Lizard girls (or doods) 
-can be the shortest for female (beside Lalafells)
- Heavensward DLC required

-Viera - Bunny girls (gender locked for lore) 
-Shadowbringers DLC required

-Hrothgar - Furry lion boyos (also gender locked) - Shadowbringers DLC required

Before getting into Classes remember that this isn't a common MMO to where if you don't like 
the class you selected at the start you have to make a whole new character, In FFXIV you can have multiple classes on a character. you just need to hit level 10 and finish the class you can change classes

-you may want to wait until you can travel to other cities if you want a class that isn't in you city though

Classes

Tanks - Takes Aggro and damage so the party lives longer

While it does need updates and bug fixes, the game's rock solid foundation make for an interesting combination between ARK and Pokemon, and does it with enough originality to be an incredibly enjoyable experience.

Looking forward to seeing new Pals added in the future. I'm onboard for the long haul.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"This review is written from the perspective of someone who has predominantly played Battlefield, and only Battlefield, since 1942 came out when I was in high school. Therefore it draws heavily on comparison between the two games, not to try to contribute to any kind of rivalry, but because it's really my only frame of reference. I'm in my mid-30s with a full-time job, so most would probably consider me a filthy casual, but I've been playing long enough to not be completely clueless.

With that said:

Hell Let Loose is the kind of epic scale, cooperative shooter that I always wanted Battlefield to be. When BF2042 came out and abandoned many of the core ideas that drew me to the series initially, I turned to Hell Let Loose out of desperation. I'm glad I did, because HLL is chock-full of those ostensibly ""only in Battlefield"" moments that keep you coming back.

If you're coming to the game from Battlefield like me, it's important to note that this is a far less arcade-y, far more strategic game. When I got started, I was constantly getting one-shotted a few seconds after spawning. Because getting it wrong is so punishing, HLL forces you to learn about good positioning and battlefield awareness. In fact, I noticed that after a few months of playing HLL that when I went back to BFV, my play had improved significantly. While definitely more hardcore than Battlefield, once I adapted I didn't find gameplay significantly more difficult or tedious, or less action-packed.

Is the game perfect? No, definitely not. It's not as polished as a AAA game, the graphics are good but not spectacular, performance isn't always great, and many of the mechanics are boring and/or frustrating (artillery, resource nodes). But the most significant factor that has made it easy to look past these complaints is the awesome community.

I had not played other, more hardcore shooters (like Squad or Post Scriptum) before, but the veterans I played with were friendly and helpful and helped me quickly acclimate. While I regularly play with a friend, unlike in Battlefield, it's not a night and day different experience between squadding up with friends and squadding up with randoms. Mic use is prevalent (in fact, I wouldn't recommend playing without one) and I've had many, many games on public servers with a full squad communicating and working together. It's awesome. 

I'll end with a tip about the game that I wish I had known before I started. Obviously, it's not a game that you win by K/D ratio alone, but then neither is Battlefield. But unlike Breakthrough or Frontlines, it's not even really about attacking or defending cap points, either. While these things are all obviously important components, at its heart this is really a game about SPAWN POINTS: building your own (garrisons, outposts) and finding and destroying the enemy's. Without actively prioritizing both of these things, I rarely see teams win, even if they're doing everything else correctly.

In short, this game saved me from the pit of sadness I experienced after the disappointment that was BF2042. I've played a ton over the past few months, and almost every game is fresh, dynamic and chaotic. It's taken on the mantle of delivering the large-scale, historical combined arms combat experience it seems DICE is no longer able to deliver. In many ways, I consider it the true spiritual successor to the original Battlefield 1942 I fell in love with so many years ago.",review written perspective someone predominantly played battlefield battlefield since 1942 came high school therefore draw heavily comparison two game try contribute kind rivalry really frame reference mid 30 full time job would probably consider filthy casual playing long enough completely clueless said hell let loose kind epic scale cooperative shooter always wanted battlefield bf2042 came abandoned many core idea drew series initially turned hell let loose desperation glad hll chock full ostensibly battlefield moment keep coming back coming game battlefield like important note far le arcade far strategic game got started constantly getting one shotted second spawning getting wrong punishing hll force learn good positioning battlefield awareness fact noticed month playing hll went back bfv play improved significantly definitely hardcore battlefield adapted find gameplay significantly difficult tedious le action packed game perfect definitely polished aaa game graphic good spectacular performance always great many mechanic boring frustrating artillery resource node significant factor made easy look past complaint awesome community played hardcore shooter like squad post scriptum veteran played friendly helpful helped quickly acclimate regularly play friend unlike battlefield night day different experience squadding friend squadding randoms mic use prevalent fact recommend playing without one many many game public server full squad communicating working together awesome end tip game wish known started obviously game win k ratio alone neither battlefield unlike breakthrough frontlines even really attacking defending cap point either thing obviously important component heart really game spawn point building garrison outpost finding destroying enemy without actively prioritizing thing rarely see team win even everything else correctly short game saved pit sadness experienced disappointment bf2042 played ton past month almost every game fresh dynamic chaotic taken mantle delivering large scale historical combined arm combat experience seems dice longer able deliver many way consider true spiritual successor original battlefield 1942 fell love many year ago
1336490,Against the Storm,"This is it!  This is the perfect game for me... and it might just be for you, too.

Do you really like city builders, but always find yourself getting bored or distracted and moving on to something else?  Really enjoy the initial base/city/planning aspects of those games but get bogged down in late game bureaucracy and tedious micro-management?

If so, this game also might be for you!

Against the Storm is the bite-size city builder that I didn't know I needed.  Enjoy the early stages of getting a base up and running, and just when things start to cross into the realm of tedium... you win (...or lose) and move on to the next settlement.  This core structure along with the fantastic and innumerable combinations of races, biomes, available resources, buildings, perks, etc. ensure you're never playing the same game twice.  Each settlement instance comes with new challenges to overcome in new ways.  A well developed and rewarding tech tree, secondary and tertiary rouge-lite elements, and a procedurally generated world map with different settlement modifiers and challenges ensure I will be playing this game for a long time to come.  With ~50 hours into the game currently, I can safely say I will get 200+ more hours of fun out of Against the Storm.

386360,SMITE®,"SMITE is a fantastic game that takes the MOBA genre into a 3rd-person perspective; allowing me to implement the aiming, timing and skills I've gained from playing other games, like shooters, but with a stronger emphasis on strategy and team building-- making the combat fast and highly addictive. 

Compared with League of Legends and Dota 2, it relies less on builds and the minions/creeps, but without removing those elements of strategy either. Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meaty, it replaces them with what gives games like first-person and third-person shooters depth. It panders to and compliments a different style, giving a different experience but in a familiar format. 

Minions aren't as relevant late game as they are in Dota, but it feels right. You're playing the role of a god, and by the time you're at end-game, you have bigger threats to worry about-- other gods. It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a tower, all at once, can't easily kill. It feels great to have your team expect you to clutch, but succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots. I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphrodite, which stun locks the enemy. 

It's about timing, weaving in and out of battle, aim and speed. Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooter, all while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA. That makes SMITE a truly unique experience.

Most people who claim SMITE ""sucks"", play LoL or Dota. They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love. They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like they’re part of a team—for the sake of ego. It’s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development; they're very, very proud.

Most of them like to say SMITE’s not as deep. I argue the opposite. I feel where it lets go in micromanaging, it substitutes with a skill-oriented, high speed combat experience. It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs. So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITE. 

I've been playing SMITE for probably a year now. I should have at least 300 hours, perhaps more. I wish my friends would play with me, but most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL. They’re better than Smite, and If I want to play with them, I’m going to have to play their favorite MOBA. 

It would enhance my experience to play with them on SMITE, but even without a single friend, this game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play it.

Moreover, SMITE is constantly evolving. New skins, new gods, new maps, redesigns, new items, nerfs, buffs, new UI, etc. In the short amount of time I've played the game, I've seen many drastic changes. If you tried Smite years ago, it’s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today-- by this time next year, it'll have drastically changed again. All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game. It continues to get better and better, and HiRez listens to the players. 

SMITE literally looks different graphically and the devs aren't scared to try some pretty wacky shit to make things more fun but balanced.

Free to play; pay to look cool. Smite's become one of my favorite games of all time.　

Note: I play LoL, Dota and Heroes of The Storm as well.

230410,Warframe,"If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself ""Destiny 2 or Warframe?"" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!

To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.

Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!

Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. 

In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!

That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!

Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!

Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.

Now at this stage you're probably saying: ""Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff."" Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.

Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.

All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!


* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.

1) ""Certain Warframes are OP"" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).

It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something ""meh"" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!

2) ""The graphics are horrible"" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.

Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.

3) ""Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs "" - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.

Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.

892970,Valheim,"Very good game, but certainly not for everyone.

Valheim is a survival RPG with a primary focus on crafting elements.   

To say it has a lot of grind is an understatement.  You WILL be spending most of your time gathering resources, even if you make your base a minimalist design.   Not everyone will like this.  Some will hate it, and some will love it.

The enemies in more dangerous areas are very punishing and you will find yourself spending days preparing to face them, and the loss of your equipment if you die will result in you grinding more to be able to recover it.  Fortunately, you can recover it.

This, however, has an effect that when get to the point you can easily defeat enemies you had to run cowardly from before, you feel a real sense of achievement. 

The sailing system is rather well done, although the ships do behave like triangle sail ships, not square sail ships.  Still, that is a choice of style over accuracy.   A triangle sale ship wouldn't look right for the era, but a triangle sale ship's behavior is better for gameplay.

As of the technical aspects, the game is still under heavy development, and it is clearly not fully optimized.  It is feature complete now as of having full gameplay and a good number of bosses implemented.

Performance isn't the best, but most people can run maximum view distance so long as they don't max out the other settings.  Max quality lighting seems to hit hard on even high performance hardware.",good game certainly everyone valheim survival rpg primary focus crafting element say lot grind understatement spending time gathering resource even make base minimalist design everyone like hate love enemy dangerous area punishing find spending day preparing face loss equipment die result grinding able recover fortunately recover however effect get point easily defeat enemy run cowardly feel real sense achievement sailing system rather well done although ship behave like triangle sail ship square sail ship still choice style accuracy triangle sale ship look right era triangle sale ship behavior better gameplay technical aspect game still heavy development clearly fully optimized feature complete full gameplay good number boss implemented performance best people run maximum view distance long max setting max quality lighting seems hit hard even high performance hardware

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"[h1]DOWNLOAD THE NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVERS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD[/h1]
I crashed like twice but didn't have a problem after I got the new game ready drivers. I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.

ULTRA EDIT:
[h1]A Flawed but Fun Experience[/h1]

I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. 

It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. 

Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. 

All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. 

In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.

Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point.",h1 download nvidia game ready driver love god h1 crashed like twice problem got new game ready driver literally making review reminder blast far jesus guy update nvidia driver ultra edit h1 flawed fun experience h1 might well actually review game current state considering attention got finished feel experienced enough core mechanic formulate accurate opinion least gameplay witcher 3 reskin cyberpunk setting considering witcher 3 amazing still yet get entirely translate narratively game excels dialogue well written acted character hard fall love walking around world exhilarating although unengaging lacking interactivity said gameplay lot fun gun pack huge punch satisfying use melee katanas specifically fun broken body reflex melee build able behead ton foe even time react game unfortunately plagued bug le severe bug especially recent hotfix myriad small immersion raping bug pop bethesda style ultimately invest player agency good writing fun gameplay end day graphic important le decision making witcher really like however game clearly ready considering recent event dev hard pressed trust incredibly bad launch said type fan deus ex dishonored fallout new vega love game wart godlike quest design game offer plenty skill check dialogue found suffice say good amount actually worked moment far really hard feeling nail game like usually get crpgs like age decadence divinity etc time judge anyone refund game wait stable version come cd projekt red really dropped ball released game state conclusion game mostly expected shame people expected game second coming jesus banking decision making quest design game delivers front everything else though fail opinion enough make game genuinely bad give score ten would solid 8 10 hopefully cd projekt red iron problem timely manner elevate standing also driving anything plain awful depends driving opinion whatever driving talking as point

1063730,New World,"Please don't consider playing a game where the players are not important enough to be given a proper explanation to bans.

My mother, who is 65+, received a ban for ""cheating"".
She plays it like a house decoration game, gathers minerals, and go on chest runs. Like a 3D version of Stardew Valley. No pvp, no chat, no company.

The Amazon team does not provide any information on what led to the 2-day ban after several emails and live chat. First rep ""Enna G."" tells me the account doesn't seem to be banned, asks me to go on live chat. On live chat ""Daniel L"" tells me to submit another ticket because live chat is for technical issues only. I replied to ""Enna G."" with a screenshot of the ban and the duration and ""Daniel H."" tells me based on that information, the ban sustains. I sent another email but decides to write this review and tell my mom to stop playing a game where she can be banned for no reason.

I received this game for free since I bought it way back when it was $0.00. My mother did spend money on it once because house decorations are pretty and she liked it.

Edit: Here's the last email from their support after asking what had happened to lead to a ban. Again no explanations were given. They've asked for no information and provided none, only canned emails that says ""based on the information you provided"" to put the responsibility on the player as if my mom's capable of cheating in their game.


Hello,

We initiated a new review based on the information you provided on appeal and have reconfirmed our initial decision that the original disciplinary action was merited in your case.

We understand this may not be the result you hoped to receive. However, please understand that we've looked into your case carefully and that any further appeals on this issue will not result in a different outcome.

1260320,Party Animals,"[b] A great party game for people who don't throw great parties. [/b]


Things to help improve your experience:

[b] 1. [/b] Accept that you are not in control of your character, the magic 8-ball Party Animals uses as a physics engine is. 
[b] 1.1. [/b] You may go flying across the arena at a moment's notice. Why? Don't ask, just accept it. 
[b] 1.2. [/b] You are able to climb back into most arenas using the jump and hold buttons together, but that's only the case until the game decides you're not.

[b] 2. [/b] Turn the the music volume [i] aaaaaaalllll [/i] the way down. Congratulations, the Ice Breaker stage is now bearable.

[b] 3. [/b] Inviting friends to your party is as easy as a digesting a chicken steak tartare. Recreate Games has decided to make Steam's social system redundant by creating their own. You'll have to set up your profile, collect your account ID and then pass them to your friends rather than just inviting them directly through Steam. 

[b] 4. [/b] There is no offline mode despite the game advertising one. As it turns out, this is a huge deal for some people. Keep this in mind if you're looking to buy Party Animals.

[b] 5. [/b] Microphone chat is ON by default. 

[b] 6. [/b] The game is intended to be played using a controller.

[b] 7. [/b] No one gets to use Moonmoon but me. It's mine. Pick something else.

[b] 8. [/b] Recreate has decided to punish people who choose to leave the game by giving them a Quick Match ban (as if this game is a serious esport), but don't do anything about people who will stay AFK in a match for prolonged periods of time. It takes a really long time for you to get kicked for being idle and replaced with an AI. If you get unlucky enough to be matched with an AFK teammate, [i] you [/i] will be the one punished if you leave, your teammate might be able to stay idle for long enough to collect the experience at the end of a match. Thanks Recreate, very cool.

[spoiler]When the game initially loads up you can use the dog character to rearrange the letters of the 'Recreate' logo while you wait. You could spend the time trying to replace the 'c' with the 't', replace the second 'r' with the 'a' and finally replace the second 'e' with the second 'r'. I'm not quite sure what to do for a 'd', but you can just position the dog at the end of the logo because D is for dog. Throw the leftover 'c' and 'e's to the side. Now you have the logo more appropriate for a studio that would do something like aforementioned points 3 and 8.[/spoiler]

Ultimately, there is a lot to enjoy here if you have the patience to put up with all of the bugs in the game's physics. Your character will never quite do what you're telling it to do and this will get you eliminated more often than not, which can be frustrating in a competitive setting.
The sound design is nice, the soundtrack absolutely is not.
The graphics are cute and highly stylised, but can already seem quite dated if you notice the weird pixel edges around fur and some objects.

236390,War Thunder,"[h1] As someone with almost 1600 hours on this ""game"", don't waste your time on this game with a ridiculous grind. [/h1]


[h1] Basic explanation of the in game economy [/h1]
This ""game"", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium ""Silver Lions"" and a premium (bought with real life money) ""Golden Eagles"" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter ""Golden Eagles"" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles.

[b] While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this ""game"", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the ""game"". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money. [/b]

[h1] And its only been getting worse. [/h1]

Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of ""Silver Lions"" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more ""Silver Lions"" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players.

[h1] In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content. [/h1]


[h1] TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.

I have played 10 hours until this review and tried 3 cities on hard.
If I can recommand this title? It depends strongly on what you expect.

If you expect a full price title like settlers or something like that, please don't buy this game. It will not make you happy.
If you expect some casual gaming title, then it could be right for you.

It is a very basic game, which will allow you to run a decent city with some (or none, if on easy diffuclty) threads. Named they are: Dragons, which try to burn your city and vikings which try to steal your gold, food and people. Oh, they also burn your city. And last, but not least there are heavy thunderstorms, which will also burn your city.

The world itself is not very huge, but it will keep you going for some time. So i would expect around 20 hours of gameplay, until the world is completely full. I would like to compare this to some Tropico titles.

Although you have to experience one major issue with this game. 
Within the version, i have written this review (104s) there is no multi-threading. The game does not scale towards other CPU cores, which will get worse the more people you have. On my machine the limit was around ~300 people. If you hit this spot, then the game will slow you down very much. I expect the developer to fix that in future patches.",first played 10 hour review tried 3 city hard recommand title depends strongly expect expect full price title like settler something like please buy game make happy expect casual gaming title could right basic game allow run decent city none easy diffuclty thread named dragon try burn city viking try steal gold food people oh also burn city last least heavy thunderstorm also burn city world huge keep going time would expect around 20 hour gameplay world completely full would like compare tropico title although experience one major issue game within version written review 104s multi threading game scale towards cpu core get worse people machine limit around 300 people hit spot game slow much expect developer fix future patch

I can go over all the generic reasons why I enjoy it such as the combat, the music, the setting/atmosphere, etc but there's plenty of other reviews going over that.

Instead I'll go over the various negatives so far.

Going from the Pre-purchase beta to launch I somehow have lost fps and stability. Graphics settings were reset with launch so at first I thought it was that but even after messing with it today it still seems worse. This is obviously very possible to get fixed in the near future so I'm not gonna hold it like a big strike against them. Also have had a few different types crashes that I didn't experience in the beta.

Balancing could also use work with there already being some determined meta picks. Some weapons and classes need buffs, pretty simple change but doesn't impact amount of fun in game overall

On the other hand not having crafting in at launch but having a microtransaction cosmetic store in at launch is super scummy and shameful of Fatshark. And not only is there a cosmetic store in what should already be a full game but the store also suffers from traditional predatory practices you see throughout the industry. Timers on things being sold that causes FOMO behavior. Rotating store? well wouldn't wanna miss out on this cool item who knows when it will appear again better buy it now.

Also having an in-game currency rather than just letting you use money so you never have exactly enough to buy something, always a little less or too much. So you're always encouraged to buy just a little more currency so that extra doesn't go to waste. Current pricing's are $2.50 for 500 currency, $5 for 1000, $10 for 2100, $20 for 4500, and $30 for 7000. Current pricing's for cosmetics are 400, 700, 800, and 2400. You do the math. 

Both are scummy and predatory practices.

Good thing they could make sure it's implemented though before core features like crafting.

The other problem I have is after claiming to have 70+ weapons available at launch https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/classes-in-darktide/60591
We have currently 65. Of those there are a lot of variant weapons as well, such as having 3 versions of the same rifle, one with slower rate of fire and higher damage, one with high rate of fire and low damage, and one balanced. Not only that but we are missing weapons that were LITERALLY SHOWED IN ADVERTISING. Take for example the Ogryn powermaul here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9yRol5UYOY&t=59s  no where to be found in game. Did Fatshark somehow forget to implement it? Who knows!

So yeah it's a weird state right now.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I have played SWTOR on and off almost since it's release.

Pro's:
1.Story Rich, player-driven and interactive.
2.Classes have a lot of diversity and functionality.
3.Professions are directly related to the Server's economy.



Con's:
1.No Oceanic Server's, however, the delay isn't too bad when compared with other games.

2. Player Numbers have been in decline but isn't too bad.

3. Bot's have amassed Hundreds of Billions of Credits which most player's buy now;

4. Economy is seriously damaged, Everything is  controlled, bought out and listed for unreasonable prices by old wealth players or undercut in vast quantities, whether that's Cartel Market Items, Profession equipment or other.

5. Virtually no Customer Support, ticket's are not acknowledged or tracked.

6. After ending a subscription status, your new status becomes ""Preferred"" and they cap how much money you can access on a character to only, 1,000,000, relatively isn't much at all as most player's have 1,000,000,000.

7. PVE Raid's aren't really that good.

8. Story lore is rich but it stagnates and often carries on, similar to the TV series ""Lost"", ifykyk.

9. Expansions haven't released any new features just new story and a few different items but nothing new.

10. You cannot Use addon's like other MMORPG's can, you can customise the User Interface, Metrics are sourced through 3rd party recording software that most Guild Member's require you to download or you cannot do raids with them (Extra Inconvenience). 

11. Graphics is getting dated but was good during it's release.

SCORE = 7/10

Summary:
Overall it's a fun  Game and in my Opinion Top 3 for all MMORPG's, that are currently available (02/05/2023).  

Note: You will become addicted if you love Star Wars and haven't played many MMORPG's. The effect does last in short bursts, usually between 2-4 weeks if you are a new player, if you are returning i cannot last more than 2 weeks. 

Thank you for reading.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"[b]To preface:[/b] [i]A lot of the issues I have with the game in its current state (as well as the state it was in when I wrote this review) have now been adressed by the developers and promises have been made to remedy those issues. But as we all know, promises are easy to make and hard to keep, so until there are actually significant improvements, this review will stay as negative (also Steam doesn't allow neutral recommendations).[/i]

Well, I've sunk over 2000 hours into this game. I've met a lot of good friends in this game's community. And until a few weeks ago, I would've wholeheartedly recommended this game to any of my friends looking for a more hardcore WW2 shooter without going down the rabbit hole of full realism.

So why the negative review?

It's really simple. Black Matter, the original developers of the game, had their issues. Their updates weren't perfect, but they at least tried to get the worst issues fixed as soon as possible via hotfixes, sometimes within a week. And they were quite tardy with content updates up to the point that stuff that was promised for 2021 wasn't even in the 2022 version, but they at least made the impression that they were working on them.

But now Team17 has taken over. Yep, the Worms NFT guys. They paid over 40 million for the IP, came in with a long-winded video in which they were talking about their devotion to historical accuracy and the player base. 

What we got was a half-baked British faction with WWI weaponry, no alternative uniforms and glaring historical inaccuracies plus a bunch of QoL issues and new bugs, and no hotfixes but an ANNOUNCEMENT that some bugs will be fixed over a month after they've been introduced. 

Now some people might say the Brit update was Black Matter's last creation before the takeover. But still, T17 deemed it fit for public consumption and released it in the state it currently is in.

Oh, and there's also been a price hike. Because new bugs cost money.

They also announced a new gamemode - with what possibly is the most abysmal, half-assed trailer you've seen north of a PS2-era cutscene that made many of the devoted players really question their dedication to the game. And judging by their track record so far, hopes for it are - as is to be expected - pretty low.

All of this does not bode well for the game's future, and similar games that are in development (Resolve, Burning Lands etc) cannot come out too quickly because it looks like the HLL ship is sinking fast, brother. And Team 17 is drilling more and more holes into the hull.

So, to sum it up: 
The game itself is fine in its basics, but declining in quality sharply lately. Still worth checking out, so maybe not dismiss it out of hand. But since all new purchases will now go directly into Team 17's pocket and he best way consumers can leave feedback for a product is with their wallets, I absolutely would not recommend paying full price for it. Wait for a big sale or get the key from somewhere else for less money.",b preface b lot issue game current state well state wrote review adressed developer promise made remedy issue know promise easy make hard keep actually significant improvement review stay negative also steam allow neutral recommendation well sunk 2000 hour game met lot good friend game community week ago would wholeheartedly recommended game friend looking hardcore ww2 shooter without going rabbit hole full realism negative review really simple black matter original developer game issue update perfect least tried get worst issue fixed soon possible via hotfixes sometimes within week quite tardy content update point stuff promised 2021 even 2022 version least made impression working team17 taken yep worm nft guy paid 40 million ip came long winded video talking devotion historical accuracy player base got half baked british faction wwi weaponry alternative uniform glaring historical inaccuracy plus bunch qol issue new bug hotfixes announcement bug fixed month introduced people might say brit update black matter last creation takeover still t17 deemed fit public consumption released state currently oh also price hike new bug cost money also announced new gamemode possibly abysmal half assed trailer seen north ps2 era cutscene made many devoted player really question dedication game judging track record far hope expected pretty low bode well game future similar game development resolve burning land etc come quickly look like hll ship sinking fast brother team 17 drilling hole hull sum game fine basic declining quality sharply lately still worth checking maybe dismiss hand since new purchase go directly team 17 pocket best way consumer leave feedback product wallet absolutely would recommend paying full price wait big sale get key somewhere else le money

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.

I enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they're primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.

Now I am giving ESO a go and I've been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It's fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what's going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It's so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that's it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I'm only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.

I prefer the combat in ESO. It's simpler. I'm OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that's it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it's just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you're using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to ""read"" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it's always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It's been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don't feel like I suck. I also feel like ""meta"" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don't really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.

Anyway, that's me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision.",first foremost solo player going compare wow personal preference solo player game seems better fit wow enjoy leveling process wow lose interest fast hit max level simply interested raiding playing group pvp like able walk away game take break time wow quest pretty boring primarily text etc character really become powerful playing solo past certain point however pattern subbing wow every time expansion come quitting shortly hitting max level giving eso go enjoying lot quest amazing fully voiced mean actually engaged paying attention going skip dialog wow quest far detailed come story behind task environment etc much zillion fetch quest kill x monster quest wow main story quest wow good rest eso end high quality engaging quest opted eso plus well open million level 19 71 hour great time prefer combat eso simpler ok never really good wow ok eso let keep simple possible run 1 bar 5 skill combat le twitchy still reactive nature block roll interrupt caster use 5 ability way simpler basic function rolling blocking interrupting way intuitive eso opinion using movement key attack key special ability monster eso easier read compared wow wow really need sort memorize different type attack ability etc know avoid counter eso target ground avoid always interrupt always roll etc easy manage ok player honestly fun feel like suck also feel like meta probably matter le eso small mistake really ruin anything might wrong still new feeling getting anyway solo player ok decent playing mmos general need voiced content keep engaged etc really liking definitely recommend hopefully help someone similar preference background make decision

892970,Valheim,"I wanted to wait until I had 100 hours into this game to give it a review. I wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title. I've played mainly solo, most games like this I do, just a personal preference until I have beat the game. This game is an early access, the only bug I have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is. The game feels completed even though it is not. You can’t say that for a lot of early access games now a days.

Let's start off with the Building aspect this game offers. The terraforming can take a little to get used to. You can’t just dig with a pickaxe underneath the layer above, you must take it all the way down. With you not being able to dig a cave, you must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example. You unlock building items as you progress through the game, I like this aspect, I suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy. While building you must add support, just like in the real world, cool concept. You must be within a certain distance of a workbench, forge, or stonecutter while building. Certain building aspects require a different crafting table.

Now let’s talk about combat. Combat in this game can be very challenging if you are under geared. You can’t go from the tier 1 zone and expect to survive in combat in the tier 3 zone. There are creatures that can 1 shot you if you are not prepared. Eat the right food for more health and have the right gear for the zone on! The boss fights I enjoyed in this game. What more can you ask, fighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing? Mobs from one biome will fight others from another! It seems skeletons will fight any mob even if they are from the same biome. It can be a sight to roll up on some greydwarves trying to fight the skeletons It can take time to acquire the materials to craft gear sense you can’t use a teleport with ore. This means you either walk, or travel by boat.

Traveling by boat can bring a lot of great views. Watching a storm while in the middle of the ocean, a lightning bolt dancing across the sky. Shortly after being able to watch the clouds dissipating, the stars shining with a purple hue in the sky can be mesmerizing. Some people may not enjoy the graphics of the game, say it looks too old. It’s the perfect art style for this game in my opinion. The physics in this game are amazing. You chop a tree down and it factors in slop, chopping direction and wind into its fall direction. There’s rain and snow fall in the game, which can cause you to become “wet” and “freezing.” 
Crafting in this game is well done for the most part. In my opinion there is a few recipes that need to be tweaked. You shouldn’t need 20 of iron bars but only a small amount of wood to craft a bow for example. Drop rates for crafting mats seem well placed except of ancient wood, my opinion, it needs to be lowered to same levels as the other “special woods.” You can plant a garden, plant trees, tame animals to have quick access to furs and meat.

After many hours of crafting, combat, building, and exploring, a game that is 1gb (Yes 1gb!) has brought me a ton of fun. Reminds me of the first times playing Minecraft or Terraria. I’ve been looking for a game to bring that feeling back.
All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these style of games as I do! Please if you enjoyed reading this or found it inciteful upgrade this review!

I’ll see you in Valheim!

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"Do. Not. Buy this game. Not in this state. Not for $40. Period. 

Negating -all- the unacceptable things Snail and Wildcard have done (coming from an official ASE player with 4.7k hours), this game is genuinely unplayable and unacceptable. They're gradually making imrpovements, though it is not enough. This company makes too much money to feel like it's okay to release a game in early access like this. Early access is an excuse to get away with throwing out an unfunctioning product for $40.

-It is entirely unoptimized. I never thought I'd say this but it makes ASE look stable in comparison. Unless you genuinely have a $5k PC, you will not be getting 60FPS without sacrificing a huge chunk of quality. 
-For the love of god do not play official, PVE or PVP. You will be given constant, and I mean constant rollbacks and crashes. 7 times in one day was my progress spontaneously set back 15-20 minutes (while also resetting spawns), so if you'd just finished taming something you'd lose it. If you just finished building something it's undone. Collecting something, those materials are gone. A lot can happen in that time, and it's infuriating for it to happen that many times a day.
-The servers go down frequently, some for 5 hours at a time before they're fixed, and there's nothing more stressful than a server crashing while you're gone from your base and waiting hours for it to come back up afraid that you'll be dead when you can get back in.
-No offline protection from NPC dinos on PVE anymore. You don't have to fear players, but especially without cryos, even PVE players can log in with all their dinos dead.
-

The two credits I can give to this game is that yes, it is beautiful environment wise (the dinos are literally the same as ASE with slightly more detailed scales) and there is some QoL from ASE, such as better building, pinging, having wild dino babies roam is a huge plus, but ultimately, this game is quite literally the Overwatch 2 of Overwatch: some QoL that's not even close to being worth the things that make it worse than the original, and the pros could be done in a patch and do not justify a new game, though in this case the new game isn't free, it's $40 and unfinished. Genuinely, -genuinely- unfinished. 

Again, negating Snail and Wildcard's unforgivable decisions, I want to love Ark. I loved ASE, so take it from a person that genuinely loved ASE. I want to like ASA, even after losing 4.7k hours of official playtime. I want to enjoy this and feel like this is ASE but better, but it's ASE and worse. So much worse and nigh unplayable. If you really have to play, wait. Do NOT buy it in this state. of my 19 hours on record, I am not exaggerating when I say roughly 3 was actual playtime.

 [td] 
 
• Gorgeous world with lots of love put into details.
• Interesting side characters with well developed stories.
• Side quests feel as interesting as the main quest.
• Exploration feels interesting and the world is somewhat memorable.
• Combat feels better than it looks.
• Lots of customisation for clothing.
• Highly recommend it for Harry Potter fans.
[/td] 
 [td] 
 
• Poor optimisation, even for high-tier GPUs. Although a lot of
the issues have been fixed since launch, it still is a demanding game.
• If you don't intend to 100% the game, this point might not bother
you much, but the amount of side activities, like Merlin's Trials and
other caves that you find, are redundant, repetitive, and rather boring.
They could have trimmed down a bit.
• Here and there bugs, but nothing too serious.

 [td][b]🌌 Content & Replay Value[/b][/td] 
 [td]To entirely finish this game you're required to sink a good amount of time on all the 4 Houses. I'd recommend playing for one House that you prefer and then do the other 3 as quickly as you can until the Map of Chambers, where you'll get the achievement. It's a bit different when it comes to main quest, but not entirely. Once you finish on one playthough I would say that you're not missing out much other than what your first experience offers.[/td] 
[/tr] 
[tr] 
 [td][b]💵 Is it worth buying? [/b] [/td] 
 [td]Yes. I pre-ordered this game and pushed through the painful frame drops at launch. I wish that wasn't the case, but overall the game offers a solid open-world experience even for non-fans of Harry Potter. Worth playing. You might learn to appreciate it as much as I did.[/td] 
[/tr] 
[tr] 
 [td][b]🎮 Steam Deck Compatibility[/b] [/td] 
 [td]The game works just fine, but it's capped at 30 frames, which can make the whole experience rather weird. With the new fixes you're still locked from experiencing the game to it's fullest potential on the Steam Deck. The settings are on low, so it's not really the best looking one.[/td]

[/td] 
 [td]Although not perfect, this game is by far the best open-world Harry Potter game so far. The world feel magical, easy to understand and offers a great experience for fans and non-fans of the franchise. I believe it's a strong entry for this game and if sequels are in the making they will open up the game even more to new possibilities. The game offers by far one of the best experiences any Harry Potter game has ever given.[/td]

[h2]In-depth[/h2]
[h3] 📑 Description: [/h3] 
 
Hogwarts Legacy is an open world that isn't afraid to impress you at every step of the way. You play as one of the Hogwarts students learning the world and exploring its secrets. Dangers are at every step and it's up to you to become the most powerful witch or wizard Hogwarts has seen in a long time.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★☆
 
Surprisingly the game has a lot more to offer than what trailers show. Combat feels good, with a large array of spells that controls the battlefield and gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.

Learning new spells is done via side quests and main missions which oftentimes are pretty nicely crafted. In the game you are faced with a lot of collecting, puzzle-solving, exploring, and sightseeing.

Although some areas of exploration can get a bit too much even for the ones that wish to complete the game 100%, the game can be fully enjoyed, and go through the main campaign and pick the side quests with a lot of enjoyment.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★ 
 
I've had a lot of fun exploring this game. Hogwarts is rich with fun areas to explore. The world continues to impress you and learning new skills and putting them to test is fun and rewarding.
 
[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★
 
This game looks absolutely stunning and it would be without a doubt one of the best-looking games I've played this year. Ray-tracing adds up with a great umph to the overall look, but due to poor performance, it can be heavily costly on your GPU.

The world and the key areas look distinguished, remarkable, and jaw-dropping. This game is a really pretty game and each screenshot I took I am not ashamed to share.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★★

Sound effects and voice acting are strong in this game and oftentimes feel very polished. I did find some skipped dialogues by the end of some conversations which may be a bug, but other than that, I think pretty much all dialogues and characters are well-voiced.

I have to remark that there's a large array of English dialects, from African, possible Uganda, to Indian accents are well done and feels nice to be able to hear such differences.
 
[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3] 
Rate: ★★★★☆
 
Although the end of the game felt a bit weak and the villain wasn't necessarily defined very well, the whole build-up of the story is interesting until that point. Characters are fascinating and despite not being a fan of Harry Potter, I can say that the world and the people are extremely interesting and I was easily captivated by the visuals and the theme the game presents.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3] 
 
🔲  Short (1-8h)
🔲 Medium (8-15h)
🔲 Long  (15-25h)
☑️ Very Long  (25h+)
🔲 Unlimited 
 
It's a fairly long game if you intend to finish this game completely and do all 4 houses. The main story alone takes a while and some side quests are too interesting to skip.
 
[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3] 
 
☑️ Easy 
☑️ Normal 
☑️ Hard 
🔲 Brutally Hard 
🔲 Impossible 
 
The game isn't too difficult and unless you wish a slightly bigger challenge there is something for you. By the end of the game, as you understand the mechanics of the game and how combat works you'll become a powerful wizard/witch.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3] 
Hogwarts Legacy is by far one of the best Harry Potter games ever created and this opens up to new possibilities for this IP. As a non-fan of the franchise, I think the game offers a strong open-world experience without overwhelming you with lots of tasks to do, unless you wish to do them. Puzzles are rather simple, but fun and the whole world made me appreciate the game even more.

1313140,Cult of the Lamb,"[h1]A cute little funny dungeon crawler, with cute little animals.[/h1]

Do you ever wanted to make your own Cult? Set up your own rules and decide how to tread your minions? Don't look further! This game comes with a free power fantasy!

Also don't get distracted by the artstyle. This game gets really dark very fast!


[h1]Story:[/h1]

Usually I would now say that I won't spoil anything, but there is not much to spoil. You are a Lamb... A sacrifice made for the old gods! But in the afterlife... In the far distance you can hear the howl of an even older god! Pledge loyalty to your new lord and avenge your death. Kill your tormentors! Create your own Cult! Build up your settlement!

But be careful not make your new ""friend"" angry! You don't want to be sacrificed again... Do you?


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

[b]The gameplay is split up in multiple parts![/b]


[b]Build up your Settlement:[/b]
Having a Cult is a lot of business. You have to take care of your little friends and keep them busy with work or by praising you! Even feeding them is your job... and cleaning up. In fact they would propably die without you, but in exchange you will get EXP points and other rewards. They even give you ressources and more!

In the end it is like that: Make your followers happy = Profit!

The happier they are the more EXP they will drop when you sacrifice them. Oh... Yes you can also sacrifice them. If you really don't like someone, just kill them on the next midnight mass. The other followers are going to love it, because you are always in the right!

There are even more activities to do, but that would take away all the fun!

The base building is also a lot of fun! Next to useful buildings like tents or woodcutter shacks, you can also decorate your village. 


[b]Fighting:[/b]
Fight your way through dungeons, unlock new abilities and gather materials for your little village! Some things are also locked behind some levels you need to pass first. There are all in all 5 dungeons, made out of multiple segements. Each run is different and the drops are always randomized! You can get better gear or better drops the more you progress and by leveling up specific skills! It feels like your average rouge-lite!

Next to bossfights you will also have the ability to rescue and hire new cult members and enter an ""infinite dungeon"" with even more rewards!

Dying is also not really a problem. You will just lose a bit of your loot and thats it. It is pretty fair. This is what I liked about the whole gameplay mechanic. I am not really a fan of games like ""The Binding of Isaac"", because they are just too brutal. But ""Cult of the Lamb"" finds the right mix between random events, hard encounters and fun, while being far less punishing!

The combat is fairly easy! You have your dodgerole and your attack. Thats it. You also have a special power! Your weapons and powers are always randomized and always different at each new start!


[h1]Atmosphere:[/h1]

Really good! The world is very interesting and it makes a lot of fun to explore. You will meet a lot of NPCs, with interesting stories to tell. There are also minigames like fishing and more! Outside of the dungeons, it is a pretty relaxed gameplay. If you don't want to fight you don't have to either. You can spend a few days just chilling in your village or explore the surroundings! The whole world is just feels so alive and colorful!


[h1]Music:[/h1]

Exactly what you would expect from such a game:

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]

I am not a fan of jokes in reviews, but this game gave me diabetes just by being so sweet. It just looks so clean and cute! I love this kind of artstyle.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

If you like ""The Binding of Isaac"" or ""Don't Starve"", this game is worth a look! Even if you are not a fan of these games you might want to give this one a try! You can feel the love the developers put into this game and on top of that it has the typical ""Devolver Digital"" quality!",h1 cute little funny dungeon crawler cute little animal h1 ever wanted make cult set rule decide tread minion look game come free power fantasy also get distracted artstyle game get really dark fast h1 story h1 usually would say spoil anything much spoil lamb sacrifice made old god afterlife far distance hear howl even older god pledge loyalty new lord avenge death kill tormentor create cult build settlement careful make new friend angry want sacrificed h1 gameplay h1 b gameplay split multiple part b b build settlement b cult lot business take care little friend keep busy work praising even feeding job cleaning fact would propably die without exchange get exp point reward even give ressources end like make follower happy profit happier exp drop sacrifice oh yes also sacrifice really like someone kill next midnight mass follower going love always right even activity would take away fun base building also lot fun next useful building like tent woodcutter shack also decorate village b fighting b fight way dungeon unlock new ability gather material little village thing also locked behind level need pas first 5 dungeon made multiple segements run different drop always randomized get better gear better drop progress leveling specific skill feel like average rouge lite next bossfights also ability rescue hire new cult member enter infinite dungeon even reward dying also really problem lose bit loot thats pretty fair liked whole gameplay mechanic really fan game like binding isaac brutal cult lamb find right mix random event hard encounter fun far le punishing combat fairly easy dodgerole attack thats also special power weapon power always randomized always different new start h1 atmosphere h1 really good world interesting make lot fun explore meet lot npc interesting story tell also minigames like fishing outside dungeon pretty relaxed gameplay want fight either spend day chilling village explore surroundings whole world feel alive colorful h1 music h1 exactly would expect game http www youtube com watch v owyrq2pae http www youtube com watch v nf cumxx3gy h1 graphic h1 fan joke review game gave diabetes sweet look clean cute love kind artstyle h1 conclusion h1 like binding isaac starve game worth look even fan game might want give one try feel love developer put game top typical devolver digital quality
1240440,Halo Infinite,"""Games as a Service"" model needs to end. Permanently.",game service model need end permanently
1190000,Car Mechanic Simulator 2021,"This is pretty realistic as someone who enjoys working on cars IRL but still simplified enough to be enjoyable for a player who is not as mechanically inclined. If you love cars, made models of cars, or even enjoyed playing with Legos as a kid. You will enjoy yourself playing this game. --9.7/10 my personal rating of this game.

I work on cars for a living so there are some things missing in this experience that you have to deal with in reality, that I wish were in this game (but I still think should be optional if a player does not wish for all the extra hassle)...

i.e. --Wiring
--transmission fluid
--brake lines
--having to bleed brake calipers and brake lines
--torquing the lug-nuts once you put wheels back on
--tie rod alignment (just to clarify, that means specifically the tie rods, more specifically tie rod thread count. Anyone who has changed a tie rod before will know what I am talking about... I am not referring to wheel alignment which is in fact in the current game).
--parking brake cables

and the interior stuff is kinda lackluster... there is more to the interior of a car than seats, benches and steering wheels.

In the future, this game should let us customize the dashes, the shifter, the gauges, the radio/stereo, the carpet/floor material and color. Just a few ideas I had.

If the game had a bit more of these realistic aspects to it, I would give it a perfect 10. As it stands, it is an excellent game! I've put several hours into it within these last couple of weeks as of writing this review and I look forward to logging many more hours in this awesome experience, especially if they release more DLC for  all the different brands of vehicles out there!

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"It's a shame, but it's in a pretty awful state currently.
NOTE: I am going to try and come back to this review as I play more, and update it with the things I do/don't like.
It's probably going to be pretty messy but I hope it helps some of you.

EDIT 1: Okay, so as it turns out this game is actually even more unplayable than I thought. In 3 hours I have crashed about 7 times, I've updated my graphics drivers and I like to think I keep my PC in overall good health so I can only think it is to do with the game rather than my PC. This game seems incredibly unstable. Playing alone and spamming saves whenever I remember seems to be the only way I can get anything done - because otherwise I will crash and lose all progress from when I last saved.

EDIT 1.1: Okay so I haven't been crashing nearly as much anymore. I wish I knew what it was that stopped the crashes, but day 1 I was just getting loads and after a couple days it has improved significantly. Performance is still pretty shitty and there are some performance bugs that are quite significant.

EDIT 2: So after they released that optimisation patch it *has* helped, but still has a long way to go. I put together a spreadsheet of how much each setting impacts the overall performance.
[url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcGezRVjaseTtr1fE3Fk7tUrGmnTDDXbn_M9N7bkmCg/edit?usp=sharing]Spreadsheet[/url]

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
The most fun I have had in ARK Survival Ascended so far was in the character creator, seeing how truly horrendous I could make my character look. The quality of the character is pretty damn good - although there are quite a few less options for some things now.

The game looks phenomenal. Absolutely stunning, it's got to be one of the best looking games I have seen in terms of general landscape and lighting. That is if you can run it, but we'll get to that.

The foliage and just all the details in general look really good. Global Illumination does a LOT of the heavy lifting in terms of how good the game looks, which is a shame because it seems to be the most demanding setting.

I haven't had the chance to check them all out, but the new buildings look pretty incredible. I love the changes they've made to the style the buildings are in and it does a lot to make things look innately pretty rather than the less than appetising structures in ASE. 

Especially happy with the change to the wall height - making them square rather than the weird rectangles they used to be.

The main menu re-design looks great and works so much better. More settings are exposed for hosting a server locally/single-player which makes it so so much easier to set up the rates and settings you want without having to outside of the game edit a .ini file.

Although there aren't many yet, having mods built directly into the main menu and allowing them to be cross platform is great and really improves how easy it is to install/manage mods without messing around with the Steam Workshop's awful UI.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
Okay the elephant in the room - this game runs truly awfully. I was worried it was going to be the case, but hoping that all the incredible tech in UE5 such as Nanite would pull things together and make it run alright. But the minimum/recommended specs are a bit of a joke - and the fact it runs awfully even on a top end system from a year or so ago is beyond crazy. I'll leave some numbers below for those interested based on my PC.

The in game UI looks good overall - but some aspects are a bit harder to read, and it overall feels a little slower/clunkier. Opening the inventory seems to take more time and that really adds up to be very irritating.

Some settings really just seem to hog most of the performance. I can get the game in a pretty good looking state, but it will run at 35fps. If I change General Shadows from High to Medium, I immediately start getting 60fps. This is a shame, because having shadows on anything lower than High makes them look awful. Medium shadows just creates a very visible cut off radius around your character where no shadows are rendered, so everything in the distance just looks totally incorrect. But it's the difference between 30 and 60fps. 

[strike]There doesn't seem to be a way to raise the difficulty/max level past 150 currently. Maybe you can edit an .ini file, but there is no setting that you can change in the menus when setting up a world.[/strike]
You can increase the difficulty by going to
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\Windows
Opening GameUserSettings.ini and underneath [ServerSettings] add OverrideOfficialDifficulty=5
The number can be anything, multiply it by 30 to get your max level. So 5 * 30 = 150. If you want max level of 180, use 6.
I also can't find a setting to increase the number of dino spawns, I really haven't ran into many dinos.

[h1]MISC:[/h1]
The new building parts are great, and a lot of improvements have been made to the building system. However I do still think that there are just some incredibly obvious pieces missing. Why are quarter floors added when there's no quarter foundation, or even a half foundation? 
You are able to place 2 quarter floors in the same square that a foundation would fit in - so surely adding in a quarter foundation which can do the same can't be that hard, right? It really limits the usability of them imo because it doesn't connect nicely to anything.

Same with quarter size wall slopes. 

Maybe I'm the crazy one - but it seems that if you are going to add a building item such as a ""quarter size"" structure, it makes sense to add the entire set of items so that any one of them actually has something to connect to in a way that makes sense and fills gaps left otherwise.


Overall - I really wouldn't recommend the game in it's current state unless you have an absolutely insane PC built within the last 12 months.

Some rough numbers:

[strike]For reference - I have a Ryzen 7 5800x, RTX 3080ti, and 32GB of RAM. The game is installed on an M.2 SSD. I run the game at 1440p.
The following numbers in no way are a proper benchmark, they are just rough averages for where I happened to be in game at the time I was testing this - but it should give you an idea of what to expect if you run a similar system to me.
Epic Settings - No DLSS - 1440p - ~15FPS
Epic Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~25-30FPS
Medium Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~40-45FPS
Low Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~60-75FPS
Low Settings - Performance DLSS - 1080p - ~70-75FPS[/strike]

-Select what Jerseys you want to play in? Nope. (Yes, This has been patched Oct 21, 2023)

-Graphics are identical to 2k22, maybe even 2k20. Officially dubbing it ""Last Gen"" Graphics, since it's embarrassing to still have nothing from the now Current Generation of consoles (PS5, Xbox Series X).
- The Rec is actually unplayable. I have waited more than 30min to find a match, with no way to leave the matchmaking screen once you ""Have teammates"". AKA, *MAYBE* one or 2 real players, and then auto-filled AI Teammates. Literally a useless game mode. (Added on Dec 1, 2023. *THIS HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE GAME.*)


I held off to buy this years game because I didn't see anything I wanted in 2k23.
I didn't think I would get duped into buying a game through false advertisements.

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"To preface, I have probably another 1000 hours in Arena from the several years it wasn't on steam. As it sits now, it in an easy way to get into Magic for free, and with enough grinding, you can avoid paying any money on it at all.

Major Cons are:
1. No Trading
2. New Developers dont care to optimize the game so it gets laggy and crashes on occasion.
3. Can't just buy the cards you want, you have to spend money on wildcards, which means a $0.30 rare on paper might cost you a few bucks if you want to just buy a deck outright.
4. Most of the good dual lands are rare/mythic which makes building decks with multiple colors grindy or expensive.
5. Difficult to get started against other players and win without spending to get a good starter deck, but there are still good budget options. YouTube helps with finding budget options.
6. Not great for playtesting eternal formats since there are only full sets going back to about 2016-2017 (The number of sets is increasingly slowly though).
7. STILL NO 3+ PLAYER MODES, WIZARDS. WHEN CAN WE GET 4 PLAYERS IN A GAME??

Pros:
1. Common and Uncommon wildcards are plentiful and I have never run out, making the bulk of decks easy to build.
2. Gold is easy to grind by just playing the game.
3. The cards you own can be put in multiple decks at once, unlike MTG Online.
4. If you do spend money, a $50 card on paper only ever costs as much as a wildcard, which can make expensive cards cheap, making wildcards a double-edged sword.
5. Play newly released cards early on arena, which is nice.
6. Unique formats to arena can be fun (i.e. Alchemy, Historic, etc) and give some variety compared to paper Magic.
7. Deckbuilder is pretty intuitive and makes finding cards that fit a theme pretty easy. Also supports importing decklists, which is very useful when you want to netdeck.

Overall I recommend. The game has its quirks and perks, and I dump a lot of hours into it despite its flaws. It satisfies the craving to play more magic when my playgroup isnt available to play in person.",preface probably another 1000 hour arena several year steam sits easy way get magic free enough grinding avoid paying money major con 1 trading 2 new developer dont care optimize game get laggy crash occasion 3 buy card want spend money wildcards mean 0 30 rare paper might cost buck want buy deck outright 4 good dual land rare mythic make building deck multiple color grindy expensive 5 difficult get started player win without spending get good starter deck still good budget option youtube help finding budget option 6 great playtesting eternal format since full set going back 2016 2017 number set increasingly slowly though 7 still 3 player mode wizard get 4 player game pro 1 common uncommon wildcards plentiful never run making bulk deck easy build 2 gold easy grind playing game 3 card put multiple deck unlike mtg online 4 spend money 50 card paper ever cost much wildcard make expensive card cheap making wildcards double edged sword 5 play newly released card early arena nice 6 unique format arena fun e alchemy historic etc give variety compared paper magic 7 deckbuilder pretty intuitive make finding card fit theme pretty easy also support importing decklists useful want netdeck overall recommend game quirk perk dump lot hour despite flaw satisfies craving play magic playgroup isnt available play person

2198510,New Cycle,"Still early on, but this feels like a pretty good city builder. They seem to want this to be a Frost Punk-ish game, but it's definitely a LOOOOOT more forgiving. It's not a mindlessly easy game, but also not what I'd call hard. If you're looking at Frost Punk and think it looks too intimidating, I'd fully recommend playing this first as like the training wheels for harder city builders.

That's not even meant to be an insult either. There are a lot of genuinely interesting mechanics to this game that ensure a consistent and logical progression each time you play. Research is based on both your actions, and the progress of the city. You can't jump into research if your city isn't getting its base supplies. You also don't have the ability to rush technology, so you have to survive the years. Sounds basic, but most survival games and city builders fail to account for these simple things.

Also worth noting that this is how a game dev should do early access. There's clearly a lot they haven't implemented yet, but in my 3 hours of trying the game out, I never once felt like the game was incomplete. No bugs, no crashes, no half assed mechanics, and performance seems super solid. They even took the effort to make the UI easy to understand, and gave you all the information you could possibly need. The only problem these devs seem to have is they're unfortunately tied to the same publisher that released Gollum.",still early feel like pretty good city builder seem want frost punk ish game definitely looooot forgiving mindlessly easy game also call hard looking frost punk think look intimidating fully recommend playing first like training wheel harder city builder even meant insult either lot genuinely interesting mechanic game ensure consistent logical progression time play research based action progress city jump research city getting base supply also ability rush technology survive year sound basic survival game city builder fail account simple thing also worth noting game dev early access clearly lot implemented yet 3 hour trying game never felt like game incomplete bug crash half assed mechanic performance seems super solid even took effort make ui easy understand gave information could possibly need problem devs seem unfortunately tied publisher released gollum

The game's performance was consistently disappointing, struggling to maintain a decent frame rate and delivering choppy, lag-filled graphics. On top of that, frequent disconnections from the server disrupted my gameplay, leaving me frustrated and disconnected from the intended experience.

The gameplay itself left much to be desired, with clunky and unresponsive mechanics that hindered the enjoyment of action sequences. Controls lacked the expected precision, leading to mistimed actions and missed opportunities. To make matters worse, FC 24 suffered from poor optimization, evident in excruciatingly long loading times and sluggish menu navigation.

1336490,Against the Storm,"Unquestionably the best city builder that doesnt have combat in it, imo.  

The developers understood that the most fun part of these city builders is the early phase of building your city up from nothing, getting key production online, being able to feed/house/heat your people, etc.  Once you get to a certain point in most city builders, and you get a big sprawling city with all your needs taken care of, it usually gets dull.  Unless there is some endgame in sight or some big challenge, like fending off a huge hoard in They are Billions or something, i tend to get bored after a few hours in these sort of games.

So they made a game where you play the beginning of a city builder, you are in a race against time to achieve enough goals, fulfill needs, etc.  And then you win in a couple hours.  And you do it again.  But this time, you get different random buildings, resources, quests, abilities, etc, so you have to find a totally new build order to handle things this time, so its never the same.
And there are good reasons, both for gameplay and for theme, why you are going to build cities again and again.

I think this is the perfect city builder for people who love to play the early part of your city, who want efficiency to matter a lot, to be racing against time, and who want to have to adapt to completely different setups and building availability and create a new build order for each game.",unquestionably best city builder doesnt combat imo developer understood fun part city builder early phase building city nothing getting key production online able feed house heat people etc get certain point city builder get big sprawling city need taken care usually get dull unless endgame sight big challenge like fending huge hoard billion something tend get bored hour sort game made game play beginning city builder race time achieve enough goal fulfill need etc win couple hour time get different random building resource quest ability etc find totally new build order handle thing time never good reason gameplay theme going build city think perfect city builder people love play early part city want efficiency matter lot racing time want adapt completely different setup building availability create new build order game

294100,RimWorld,"Our small colony was flourishing until Bacon joined.  See... nobody was allowed in the kitchen except Umami and Cookie, they had things under wraps but Bacon, Pigskin Rancher by trade, joined right as our colony was descended upon by 47 man eating Persian Cats and we must have forgotten to tell him the rules. He snuck in one morning with the well-meaning intention of making the other colonists breakfast as a thanks for saving his life. It was a sweet gesture, nobody though anything of it, until it came to light that Bacon, despite their name, had no idea how to cook.

What appeared to be some innocent, and well intentioned pancakes began the downwards spiral to our demise. Stricken with debilitating food poisoning we were caught out of position by an invasion, bugs swarming, teeming up from under our feet, right in the middle of our cursed dining room. Before we could react they'd bored through three sets of walls to our nursery... the kids didn't stand a chance. Only 2 year old Melons survived and only just barely. 

We thought that was the extent of our misfortunes, but delirious with food poisoning still, exhausted, and wracked with grief one of the despondent mothers snapped, attempting to take a knife to Melons neck. Umami, a frail old man, attempted to intervene but her rage was his end, and it was his head she claimed in the end. Umami, a friend of everybody, had been a pillar of the colony since day one, he'd fallen from the stars and survived the other founders, he'd been a face everybody had known, everybody turned to, the gentle, elderly leader of our colony since anybody could remember. And now he was dead.

You could say that hope died with Umami. With the kindly old elder slain, with our future generation culled before they even understood the world, and with one of the sacred matrons rotting in prison it was a slow, heart rending spiral. The wise left, the determined stayed to be bent and broken attempting to carry the colony, and so when the raiders from the north arrived you could argue that we were already dead. Our individual hearts were pumping blood through our individual bodies, but the heart of the colony had stopped long before.

397540,Borderlands 3,"I actively play this game with my father who enjoys shotguns. The creativity of the different shotguns he can experience and the feel of the weapon have lead him to this summary review: ""pretty good game for 20 bucks"" which is a level above his satisfactory review of: ""it's okay"" when it comes to reviewing entertainment of any kind (games, movies, TV).

In terms of my personal point-of-view, I deeply enjoy the perpetual escort mission that is leading my father to where the danger is and routinely reviving him because he has not figured out how to move and shoot simultaneously. To add, the ability to ping the map to call for him like a dog has immensely improved my the efficiency of my communication skills while also helping him see key items and weapons for him to consider (he suffers from progressive ophthalmoplegia).

Lastly, I would rate this game as ""fairly difficult"" due to the necessity of needing to constantly revive him throughout fights, thus massively increasing the longevity and engagement with this game.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"Update: 01/26/2022 

This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.

Updated: 06/03/20

The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.

Original Review Written 03/20/2019

I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. 
 
I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated.

Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for?

238960,Path of Exile,"Simply the most in-depth Hack'n'Slash out there and the best according to me. Character customization is top-notch and replayability is huge. I have a little bit over 1k hours played on it (did not link the game to my steam account immediately) and I still  have many things to discover. However, it is a ""hardcore game"" less accessible than Diablo 3 or others games.

Pros:
- Huge passive skill tree offering in-depth character customisation
- Interesting spell customisation using gems (close to FFVII's materia system)
- Interesting trading system relying on barter only (no gold or any other in-game currency)
- Interesting crafting system allowing to modify dropped items
- Game is very skill based (rare for a hack'n'slash!)
- Very little Faceroll/OP builds, almost every build has drawbacks and strength

Cons:
- Can be hard to get into: trading system can seem overwhelming and in-game mechanics are quite complicated so use of the wiki and forum is much advised
- Animation can seem clunky at the beginning and game seems to play slow at the beginning
- Player can feel like reaching a gear-ceiling at the beginning of end-game if playign self-found (much better since Forsaken Master's 1.2 update though)

2157560,Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising,"It's got a free to play version with rotating characters, the game has simpler inputs that are ENCOURAGED to use even at a higher level but still also has all our favorite motion inputs if that's how you want to play. 

The lobby system is gotdamn beautiful. queue up into ranked or casual, explore the islands for hidden cabs to play on, PLAY FUTBOL with your player avatars, etc. The crane to unlock character colors, player badges, digital figures, etc. is neat and no premium currency that I know of. Coins and xp that you earn in single player modes (outside of story) could use some bumping up though.

The game's OOZING with fun, weeby characters with tons of personality, lots of character-specific dialogue pre- and post-match, each character has a progression pass to help you unlock colors and things for your favorite characters, AND YOU GET A PARTNER AVATAR OF ONE OF THE GRANBLUE CHARACTERS TO BE YOUR COACH DURING YOUR GAMES.

THIS GAME HAS CROSS PLAY SUPPORT AND ROLLBACK NETCODE (the good kind for my non-FGC friends).

The Granblue community, whether it be thru their mobile gacha, or GBVS previously, has been very kind and accepting to newer players and the game IS graspable to attain a level of skill that you'd be content with if you're coming into this game as a newer player.

It's training mode is great for both lab monsters and new players alike. if you want frame data, you've got it. if you want combo trials that let you freely practice to your heart's content, you've got it. If you want to learn how to punish a particular character's move, there's a real possibility the game has a lesson for it. If you want to learn your character's gameplan, the game has a lesson for it. 

The game also has a Fall Guys mode using your player avatars, AND a visual novel/side-scroller beat'em up/fighting game/RPG story mode, so even if you're not big into the fighting game aspect, there are several other ways to enjoy the systems in the game on your terms. THESE MODES ARE (MOSTLY) AVAILABLE TO PLAYERS WHO ALSO PLAY THE FREE VERSION OF THE GAME (you only have access to the first of 3 chapters in story mode though.)

2198510,New Cycle,"Recommend with a heavy dose of you are desperately bored, masochistic, like to support EA games, Devs have blackmail on you. Or really any combination of the above, I can only say I tagged at least 3 of those. 

I am really enjoying it, until around tech 4 or 5. As others have covered better, game needs some serious tech balancing. I know nothing on the Devs so hopefully updates are a given and they'll be on their game. 

Because, like I said, I'm digging it. 
- Art is good enough, there has been so many PA city builders (and that is my nice so hard I will always try em out), the art has all sort of blended together and nothing is standing out yet. 

- I'm liking the solar flare and electricity angle, core mechanics feel solid and while it's not brand new they are tweaked enough it doesn't feel stale or give you that 'I've played this 10 times' vibe. 

- Story and flavor elements, while delivered annoyingly with unskippable cutscenes (and weirdly long loads for a choice screens), seem to be the strongest area. Already hate what I'm assuming is going to be an antagonist. Most importantly their world building seems solid. I'm a huge PA genre dude, hell used to wear costumes in the Mojave for weeks at a time at festivals so maybe that's an understatement. But the world building and details are what/breaks these games for me, and the Devs (hopefully) have something fresh here.

If you enjoy Owlcat games, know what to expect ie, afew bugs here and there, lots of combat, a huge amount to learn, read. Huge build depth, great characters, worlds and general rpg goodness, then this game nails all those things yet again.
If you also enjoy 40k setting, like myself its a must buy tbh, and owlcat captures the setting very well. Music is top tier, writing ext all fantastic, and will get you hooked fast.

If your  coming from bg3, and expect a game thats fully voiced, dont want to read alot and thought bg3 was complex in build and mechanic depth then maybe this game isn't for you unless ur willing to put the time in.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Holy shiiiiiiiiieeeettt this game is nice.

I was skeptical at first.

I bought the game.

I joined, did the tutorial, found all the secrets from tutorial (there are plenty!!!).

First outpost I spawn, I take quests, search for loot, my boat gets raided, even if its empty.

I stay at the outpost for 30-40 minutes, My boat gets raided 3-4 times in the process.

After 40 minutes, I go to the boat, and inside, there are chests, treasures, and some random dude talking.

Apparently somebody saw I was getting owned and decided to ""protect"" me for my first gameplay. They gave me treasures, helped me do quests and all for the price of an Uber (get them to a location). They were AWESOME, FUNNY and HELPFUL as hell. Best pirate experience with them.

After I dropped them off there, I did several quests, I ran from other players as they were chasing me, I managed to DEFEAT another ship in a 1v2 situation, stole their loot, ran away, sold it, it was epic.

All this in 4 freaking hours!

Even if the quests are some kind of repetitive, the PvP element is awesome!.

I don't regret any money spent on it, too bad I don't have any friends playing this masterpiece.

Positive review, as I haven't had bugs or unpleasant gameplay. 


PS: Great optimization also, 2080S + 4790K, 1440p, Mythical graphics (max), 100 fps. Amazing!


Part 2 (10 hr gameplay): 

So I played again, 2nd gameplay, I finished first 3 Tales and it was a ""good"" gameplay.

This time I haven't seen a single friendly person. I've been attacked and raided about 6-7 times, sometimes by solo, sometimes by gang of 3-4. But I adapted quickly.

At first I went to cash in my voyages and treasures ( i had 3 chests with 9 skulls, 3 chests with 9 gold items, a crying chest and 2 regular treasure chests, all from farming/voyage). I went to an outpost, I did a 360 to make sure there's nobody there, then docked the sloop. When I went with the first chest of 3 skulls, there was a dude hiding in a bush next to the Bones tent, he jumped out, gave me a heart attack, then took a shot at me. He missed the shot, I dropped the chest and I went full ape on him, killing him. Then I ran to drop all my treasures, cause since he didn't have a boat, meant his team mates are circling around. On that run I felt like mom's spaghetti, palms were much sweatyyy... 

Amazingly, I managed to cash in ALL my treasures, and THEN, the bad guys were aready at my ship. I saw them trying to ram it in the rocks. I throw 2-3 blast bombs and they drop in water, then I shoot them down with the pistol. Managed to get back in my ship, repair it , and went full speed into their big ship, while they were respawning. I didn't stay to repair mine, I just shot their ship down, then ran away.

Then I got killed and ship sank about 4 times, twice from crew of 4 , once from a duo on a sloop, they put a barrel on my ship and sank it down, while I was doing a quest ... and once from the freaking kraken, right AFTER I FINISHED A TALE...  Lost a lot of treasures including the Tale treasure, but....

While trying not to ragequit, I saw a crew of 4 again, probably same guys, they were fighting a skeleton ship. I got close and managed to spot 2 of the 4 guys, confirming it was the crew that gangbanged me (i think ^_^ ) . I went to them, flanked them and placed them between me and the skull ship. Shot them 3-4 times, then with a singing/dancing cannonball and a fire cannonball, and their ship started to sink and burn. I saw them jumping in the water. I went there to see if they ""need"" help and just finished the job, shooting them in the water. Then I took ALL their treasures, which compensated a lot over my loss, and went to a safe outpost.

That feeling was the best. Yes, I lost some battles, but also won a few. First gameplay, 4 hours, 2nd gameplay, 10 hours straight. The PVP element is priceless in this game, otherwise it would've become boring. 

And I just found out about sunken ships, mermaids skeleton lords and kraken :)) 

New challenges ahead !!!

Edit 3: 18-June-2020

I think I had enough of this game. While there are 3-4 random people/ships that are friendly, most of the players I've encountered in the last days are simply apes. 

I see medium ship with 3 people, I run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasure, sail away, they chase me for 10 minutes, until I stopped to see what they want. They simply killed me on sight.

I see sloop with 2 people chasing me, my ship is empty, I tell them ship is empty, and that I'm going on a Tale, they simply sank my ship.

Finally, I have +10 skulls, 9 gems, 10 treasure chests. I see galeon with 4 people, I avoid it, I run to outpost and manage to sell everything.
Then I go on a tale, they simply start chasing me. I tell them I am solo, ship is empty, they start firing at me. I do a handbrake 180'Turn, run against the wind, somehow they catch me sideways (AGAINST THE WIND, they say sloop is fastest against wind). They hit me with hook, take me away from my ship, in the middle of the ocean. I respawn, they are in my ship, burning it down.
All 4 of them were like ""SORRY MAN, WE THOUGHT YOU HAD LOOT, SORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIP, SORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES"".
4v1, 2 of them were LEGENDS, I am a fucking bamby learning the game, two of them have +500 hours in game.

This is fucking pathetic. Instead of going to fight the 3-crew ship, they chose to chase a 1-crew Sloop with no fucking loot.

In the last 2 days I haven't seen a single friendly dude. Everybody tried to shoot/sink my ship.

At some point, I get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers... for ganging up a fking solo.

I tend to Change my review to No, since there's no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3-4 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty ship.

PS: Even with apes chasing me on the sea, in solo mode, I managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apes.

Edit 4: I've played a bit before my holiday and for some reason, it was surprisingly amazing. I joined as usual, as a solo Scoop, but I forgot to set it to Private. After about 5 minutes, I get a random crew member who scared the living thing out of me... lel... He was a legend, he was very funny and helpful. For some reason, he didn't mind playing with me and helping me do tales and treasure hunting. I believe I wanted to play for half an hour, and ended up playing a 8-hour session with him, talking about the game and telling jokes and chilling at some  ""grog"". 

We've had also some fair PvP, 2v2 and 2v3, which sometimes went good ,sometimes went to shit when we fell of the ship and they stole our ship and sank it into a cliff. 

I haven't tried the new update yet, but I can surely say, you cannot play ""just a half hour session""... 4 sessions ... 30 hours... that says it all.",holy shiiiiiiiiieeeettt game nice skeptical first bought game joined tutorial found secret tutorial plenty first outpost spawn take quest search loot boat get raided even empty stay outpost 30 40 minute boat get raided 3 4 time process 40 minute go boat inside chest treasure random dude talking apparently somebody saw getting owned decided protect first gameplay gave treasure helped quest price uber get location awesome funny helpful hell best pirate experience dropped several quest ran player chasing managed defeat another ship 1v2 situation stole loot ran away sold epic 4 freaking hour even quest kind repetitive pvp element awesome regret money spent bad friend playing masterpiece positive review bug unpleasant gameplay p great optimization also 2080s 4790k 1440p mythical graphic max 100 fps amazing part 2 10 hr gameplay played 2nd gameplay finished first 3 tale good gameplay time seen single friendly person attacked raided 6 7 time sometimes solo sometimes gang 3 4 adapted quickly first went cash voyage treasure 3 chest 9 skull 3 chest 9 gold item cry chest 2 regular treasure chest farming voyage went outpost 360 make sure nobody docked sloop went first chest 3 skull dude hiding bush next bone tent jumped gave heart attack took shot missed shot dropped chest went full ape killing ran drop treasure cause since boat meant team mate circling around run felt like mom spaghetti palm much sweatyyy amazingly managed cash treasure bad guy aready ship saw trying ram rock throw 2 3 blast bomb drop water shoot pistol managed get back ship repair went full speed big ship respawning stay repair mine shot ship ran away got killed ship sank 4 time twice crew 4 duo sloop put barrel ship sank quest freaking kraken right finished tale lost lot treasure including tale treasure trying ragequit saw crew 4 probably guy fighting skeleton ship got close managed spot 2 4 guy confirming crew gangbanged think _ went flanked placed skull ship shot 3 4 time singing dancing cannonball fire cannonball ship started sink burn saw jumping water went see need help finished job shooting water took treasure compensated lot loss went safe outpost feeling best yes lost battle also first gameplay 4 hour 2nd gameplay 10 hour straight pvp element priceless game otherwise would become boring found sunken ship mermaid skeleton lord kraken new challenge ahead edit 3 18 june 2020 think enough game 3 4 random people ship friendly player encountered last day simply ape see medium ship 3 people run fast outpost manage sell every treasure sail away chase 10 minute stopped see want simply killed sight see sloop 2 people chasing ship empty tell ship empty going tale simply sank ship finally 10 skull 9 gem 10 treasure chest see galeon 4 people avoid run outpost manage sell everything go tale simply start chasing tell solo ship empty start firing handbrake 180 turn run wind somehow catch sideways wind say sloop fastest wind hit hook take away ship middle ocean respawn ship burning 4 like sorry man thought loot sorry sank ship sorry killed 3 time 4v1 2 legend fucking bamby learning game two 500 hour game fucking pathetic instead going fight 3 crew ship chose chase 1 crew sloop fucking loot last 2 day seen single friendly dude everybody tried shoot sink ship point get think game filled low ego real life underachiever ganging fking solo tend change review since fun getting chased every 5 minute crew 3 4 people nothing better bullying solo player empty ship p even ape chasing sea solo mode managed make almost 80k gold one gameplay lost 1 treasure chest ape edit 4 played bit holiday reason surprisingly amazing joined usual solo scoop forgot set private 5 minute get random crew member scared living thing lel legend funny helpful reason mind playing helping tale treasure hunting believe wanted play half hour ended playing 8 hour session talking game telling joke chilling grog also fair pvp 2v2 2v3 sometimes went good sometimes went shit fell ship stole ship sank cliff tried new update yet surely say play half hour session 4 session 30 hour say

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I've been playing this game for years and I'm very happy to see it come to Steam! I don't know exactly how many hours I actually have, but I'm sure it's well over 3-4,000. Sometimes that is a mark of shame, and sometimes that is a mark of pride. 

[b]Is it still worth playing?[/b] Hell yes. I've been playing for many years and I still find stuff to do every single day. [b]Will you enjoy your time?[/b] That's for you to find out. Everyone is different and what people look for in MMOs is no exception. IMO, this is one of the greatest MMOs ever made, but that does not mean it isn't without flaws. The content releases are few and far between (but there is so much already here that's not necessarily an issue), sometimes EA has been known to flex their cash shop muscle in annoying ways, and I won't lie, this community is one of the more toxic ones I've been apart of. There are some very good people who play and will give you the world, but there are also a ton who will put you down for breathing the wrong way. Turn chat off when you're not enjoying group content and you'll probably be much happier.

If you like Star Wars and a decent storyline, you will love this game and all of its branching paths. Even after finishing the 8 class stories, there are ways to play those stories differently on a second run. It's entirely possible to lose yourself while creating alternate characters, and imo, that's a great thing. 

Also it should be mentioned this is probably the only MMO where you can bang several NPCs. Yes, that is an important feature. Bioware did not forget their hopeless romantics and perverts. Just saying.

[b]First, a few bits of advice:[/b] 

If you subscribe once, you get all current content permanently and that is a LOT of content. After you do so, if it's only the access to content you're after, you no longer need to keep subscribing.

The free to play version was improved recently and now you can have up to 1 million credits at a time. This will still get you decently far even in the game's current economy. Get a legacy bank and put your money inside of it. This bank is legacy-wide, meaning you can access it on multiple characters. You can do this by buying the Dromund Kaas or Coruscant stronghold (it's very cheap) and placing the one you get in the mail anywhere inside of your room. (Note, you may need to level your legacy a little bit.) When you're about to go over 1 million credits, store it there.

ADD THE SECURITY KEY APP TO YOUR PHONE AND CONNECT IT TO YOUR ACCOUNT! You get 100 free cartel coins (cash shop currency) every single month. That is a big deal. It adds up quickly. You will not regret it.

When you first make a new character, press Y. They don't tell you to do this. Make a legacy, give yourself a last name for all your characters. Do it ASAP, because you'll want to level that baby. It's important.

If you do subscribe, don't waste your time in the cash shop. Everything in the cash shop you can get in the game without spending real money by simply farming credits. There are many, many, many ways to farm quickly, but there is a guide by swtorista which explains it best. Go find her and watch a bunch of her videos, she's great.

The real value in this game are the 8 class stories and the DLC story content. This is not an MMO where the end game actually matters or will even go anywhere. If you find a friend group interested and they're fun to get involved with, fine, but if you're not enjoying the storylines there is very little point to playing. Don't skip the cutscenes the first time around. Give this one a fighting chance.

When you're leveling, even on free to play you can skip most of the side quests (there are a ton of them). Stick to the story and do all the heroics on every planet. You'll get the gear you need and likely be appropriate level.

Each class has a buff they can share with other people. When you finish a class story, you can use that buff on other classes. This is why some people can share all 4 buffs at once. If you're enjoying the game, leveling each class type (only 4--BH = Trooper, SW = JK, Agent = Smuggler, Inq = Consular) might be a decent goal to keep in mind.

And finally: Don't fall in love with Quinn. He's a jerk. (Kidding.)

If you ever want to know more, check out swtorista's guides, she's an old gem and has a whole series dedicated to the Steam players coming in. This game isn't terribly complicated to get into or even play (especially for people who are familiar to MMOs), but they might help should you need it.

703080,Planet Zoo,"Buckle up, because I'm going to attempt a comprehensive review of Planet Zoo.

I have the impression that you may be interested in buying this game because you, like me, played Zoo Tycoon 2 when you were a kid and this game seems to just have the same vibe. However, Planet Zoo both is and isn't a re-skin of Zoo Tycoon 2, though to render an objective judgement is unfair; the quality of these differences are up to you to decide, and I will attempt to simply list them here.

Before you even consider buying this game, you need to consider your system. A low-end or subtle gaming laptop can probably run this game on low settings, but you will encounter some massive FPS drops in larger zoos with more objects. I originally bought this game not long after release and the Arctic DLC but never played it because my old computer simply could not handle it. A new-ish gaming setup is probably necessary to get the full experience from this game.

First and foremost, this game is obviously a graphics and general ""behavior"" upgrade over Zoo Tycoon. Part of the aforementioned ""full experience"" is being able to see your animals in high detail behaving like they do in the wild. The sounds are clear and crisp with realistic behaviors. The developers did their research when creating these animals and putting them into the game, with a reasonable variety. If the animals alone are a selling point for you, then by all means, stop reading my review and buy the game. However, there is more to the game than the animals, and buying solely for the animals, then not using the rest of the game, is really not going to get your money's worth.

The second topic that I would like to talk about, and is perhaps the broadest, is the different game modes. Like Zoo Tycoon, the Sandbox mode allows you to create the zoo of your dreams without concern for money. Furthermore, you an also express your full creativity in Sandbox mode, making custom buildings (or shells, you can't design the interior of a staff room or keeper's hut) and habitats, including domes. Unless you are inherently rather artistic, you might be more baffled and estranged by these options, and taking advantage of them requires watching a few YouTube tutorials and just videos to see what other people do. For the artistic, or those who are at least confident in their abilities, you will almost certainly enjoy the freedom given to you in building creation. (Fun fact: you CAN turn on money and conservation credits in the Settings menu in Sandbox mode.) Franchise mode is where I have, to my own surprise, logged most of my hours. The pressure to successfully operate one zoo, and eventually many others, is surprisingly fun, and I actually enjoy using the animal market with other players. There are some computer-generated animals on the market in Franchise mode, but they are usually not as good as those which other players put up for sale. Challenge mode is similar, but is completely offline, and thus the animal market is entirely dependent upon what gets generated for you. If you want the thrill of running a zoo but dislike the animal market, you will probably enjoy Challenge mode. Since there is a sizable player-base, Franchise mode is my go-to with a thriving animal market. The last mode is Career mode, which I am torn on. You MUST play through at least the first three scenarios to really learn how to play this game, and I recommend the fourth as well. [spoiler] The fourth scenario has you build your own zoo from scratch, so if you're not sure what to do, I recommend playing some sandbox first. [/spoiler] However, some of the scenarios can be a bit frustrating and admittedly, I haven't finished them all, so don't take my word for it.

Third is the micromanagement. Some people hate the amount of micromanagement, but I actually enjoy it. It goes beyond simply making sure your animals are happy and healthy down to the condition of barriers and the zoo, including staff work zones. (You learn more about this in an early career scenario!) Different animals also have different costs of feeding, which is something to keep in mind. [spoiler] For example, the Gray Seal, while a high-appealing animal, is liable to eat you out of house and home. I am lucky that it draws a lot of donations to offset the cost and produce a profit, but I would not recommend it for a beginning Franchise Zoo. The Polar Bear also eats an insane amount ($10k from what I saw in a YouTube video), and elephants and other megafauna also eat a lot. Be wary of this when planning your zoos. [/spoiler] In this regard, I am struggling to find words to describe just how much actually goes on in the game and can only be experienced through playing.

Fourth, congratulations on reading this far! Some people have reported crashes and freezes. I think most of these have been ironed out after launch, and in 2021 I have not had issues with game crashes. You may have noticed that this game has DLC. You DO NOT need to buy the DLC to enjoy the game to the fullest, but if you like the animals, go ahead and buy it to support the devs! The DLC is also great for the more creative players, providing a lot of new construction pieces to build your already-perfect buildings. It is true that the pathing tool is quite finicky and can be a pain to learn how to use, though with some practice you'll get the hang of it. (Mostly.) ""The guest is always right,"" but really, the guests can be plain stupid; the viewing platform is excellent, but if an animal isn't right close to them, they think the view of said animal is ""fine at best."" Guests can also get stuck on paths, which creates a massive guest traffic jam, eventually entrapping your staff, so when things go south, see if your staff is stuck; you'll need to move the guests one-by-one to free them and also ensure your paths are wide enough.

The bottom line is that Planet Zoo can be compared to the Civilization series, though ""One more turn"" becomes ""one more little thing needs to be done;"" you probably won't run out of things to do. You do need to sink in a fair amount of time to get your money's worth from the game. Being the stingy individual that I am, I would recommend buying this game when it's on sale, especially if you're on the fence. If you think this game speaks to you like no other, then go ahead and buy it now at full price. It is an extremely fun and addictive game, but there is a steep learning curve to using some of the tools. YouTube videos are almost mandatory if this is your first game from this ""genre,"" otherwise you will run the risk of becoming frustrated. However, if running a zoo doesn't appeal to you, especially taking care of animals and dealing with guests, who are sometimes quite dumb, Planet Zoo may not be for you. 9/10 would recommend to anyone who is interested.",buckle going attempt comprehensive review planet zoo impression may interested buying game like played zoo tycoon 2 kid game seems vibe however planet zoo skin zoo tycoon 2 though render objective judgement unfair quality difference decide attempt simply list even consider buying game need consider system low end subtle gaming laptop probably run game low setting encounter massive fps drop larger zoo object originally bought game long release arctic dlc never played old computer simply could handle new ish gaming setup probably necessary get full experience game first foremost game obviously graphic general behavior upgrade zoo tycoon part aforementioned full experience able see animal high detail behaving like wild sound clear crisp realistic behavior developer research creating animal putting game reasonable variety animal alone selling point mean stop reading review buy game however game animal buying solely animal using rest game really going get money worth second topic would like talk perhaps broadest different game mode like zoo tycoon sandbox mode allows create zoo dream without concern money furthermore also express full creativity sandbox mode making custom building shell design interior staff room keeper hut habitat including dome unless inherently rather artistic might baffled estranged option taking advantage requires watching youtube tutorial video see people artistic least confident ability almost certainly enjoy freedom given building creation fun fact turn money conservation credit setting menu sandbox mode franchise mode surprise logged hour pressure successfully operate one zoo eventually many others surprisingly fun actually enjoy using animal market player computer generated animal market franchise mode usually good player put sale challenge mode similar completely offline thus animal market entirely dependent upon get generated want thrill running zoo dislike animal market probably enjoy challenge mode since sizable player base franchise mode go thriving animal market last mode career mode torn must play least first three scenario really learn play game recommend fourth well spoiler fourth scenario build zoo scratch sure recommend playing sandbox first spoiler however scenario bit frustrating admittedly finished take word third micromanagement people hate amount micromanagement actually enjoy go beyond simply making sure animal happy healthy condition barrier zoo including staff work zone learn early career scenario different animal also different cost feeding something keep mind spoiler example gray seal high appealing animal liable eat house home lucky draw lot donation offset cost produce profit would recommend beginning franchise zoo polar bear also eats insane amount 10k saw youtube video elephant megafauna also eat lot wary planning zoo spoiler regard struggling find word describe much actually go game experienced playing fourth congratulation reading far people reported crash freeze think ironed launch 2021 issue game crash may noticed game dlc need buy dlc enjoy game fullest like animal go ahead buy support devs dlc also great creative player providing lot new construction piece build already perfect building true pathing tool quite finicky pain learn use though practice get hang mostly guest always right really guest plain stupid viewing platform excellent animal right close think view said animal fine best guest also get stuck path creates massive guest traffic jam eventually entrapping staff thing go south see staff stuck need move guest one one free also ensure path wide enough bottom line planet zoo compared civilization series though one turn becomes one little thing need done probably run thing need sink fair amount time get money worth game stingy individual would recommend buying game sale especially fence think game speaks like go ahead buy full price extremely fun addictive game steep learning curve using tool youtube video almost mandatory first game genre otherwise run risk becoming frustrated however running zoo appeal especially taking care animal dealing guest sometimes quite dumb planet zoo may 9 10 would recommend anyone interested

I don't really have any complaints about the game, besides a glitch here and there but that's not a big deal to me. The only thing I would really like to see change is to have a trophy room added to the game. It didn't really bother me much that there wasn't one, until yesterday when I harvested the legendary Red Deer in Hirschfelden. I was a little dissapointed that I couldn't go back and look at how big it is. So my idea is to have a trophy room, and either have it display the top 10 scoring animals a person has killed, or have the hunter be able to select if they want a trophy in there, with a maximum of 20 trophies allowed.

1313140,Cult of the Lamb,"A nice, cute and short video game. Also, don't get confused by the ""roguelike"" tags, this actually shouldn't be considered one and I've no idea why people think it is.

Why? When you say ""roguelike"" people immediately imagine a video game with a really long progression system, a lot of replayability, with a ton of content and playable for dozens of hours, usually even more than a hundred before you actually do everything there is to do. This game simply doesn't have that. It's a relatively short but sweet mix of light dungeon crawling and light colony management. You can probably beat it in 10 hours if you play it on a normal difficulty and don't try to go for all the side content. And once you finish the game, that's pretty much it, there's very little reason to come back top it and play it past that point.

So, if you're looking for a roguelike, this isn't it. Don't get confused by the tags. So if that's what you're looking for, you should turn back and walk away. But if you want to play a really enjoyable little game for a couple of evenings, then this is definitely it!",nice cute short video game also get confused roguelike tag actually considered one idea people think say roguelike people immediately imagine video game really long progression system lot replayability ton content playable dozen hour usually even hundred actually everything game simply relatively short sweet mix light dungeon crawling light colony management probably beat 10 hour play normal difficulty try go side content finish game pretty much little reason come back top play past point looking roguelike get confused tag looking turn back walk away want play really enjoyable little game couple evening definitely

My resources were nearly exhausted, and my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution. I declared war. Alas, the allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the Unbidden so I had to make a hard decision. I left the Federation that I had built and given everything to and declared war on my own.

899770,Last Epoch,"[b]INTRO[/b]
(Review character limit !@#$)

This game is a top down looter/hack and slash ARPG, this review is aimed at those familiar with such games and there will be comparison with Path of Exile and Diablo, as both are THE genre, currently.

So I wont bother explaining basic stuff but rather introduce the plate briefly,
then dive into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the game.

My point of view is someone who has over 1k hours in PoE, 300 in the Diablo franchise, and about 50 into this one 
(Steam hours are misleading, as I have played the game on other accounts as well) Rookie numbers, some might say, and rightly so.

In that case, feel free to add words or provide counter argument to mine. I will also try to keep this review updated as the game continues to develop and grow.

[b]THE PLATE[/b]

First of all I would like to start by saying that the game is absolutely [b]worth[/b] its current price tag (30 euros) in its [b]current[/b] state: Early Access, version 8.1

The game has easily 50-100 hours of pure gameplay content, before any future ""seasons/leagues"" that have already been foreshadowed by the devs, and which will be set in time periods [b]between[/b] the already existing ""leagues"" of its main competitor, PoE.

I feel this is an important topic that needs to be adressed, as these types of games are usually played in ""bursts"" of content updates, alongside other players, in an ""asymmetrical"" competition/cooperation marathon.

There is also currently NO multiplayer but its been scheduled to be included within 2021. The only current form of social features are global/personal chat and friend list. There are also plans to include PvP, but frankly, these games are never balanced or designed around that, so its just an extra side feature.

[b]HARD COMPARISON WITH ESTABLISHED PATH OF EXILE SYSTEMS[/b]

This is the only part of my review where PoE will be mentioned directly.

This is by no means a ""PoE hate rant"", I just want to highlight that there is a very clear difference in systems and design philosophy, permeating through the entirety of the game. Obviously, at the time of writing, and most likely a while longer, this early access title is hardly near the content of one of the most notoriously complex games on the market that is approaching nearly a decade of constant updates.

First of all, you do not need to download a lootfilter or watch several video guides totaling hours to understand and enjoy the majority of the game as a new player. 

This game has learned from both the successes and missteps of the genre, as I feel all games must. It strikes a nice balance between the overwhelming complexity of PoE and the baffling simplicity (that is close to insulting intelligence) of Diablo 3.

Damage numbers! Seeing the constant rise of numbers you deal while progressing through the game is a nostalgic feeling I constantly miss during my PoE playtime.

In the case of lootfilters the game has an excellent and easy way to setup multiple personalized ones, IN GAME. If you really want, you can still download and import a ready one. 
In the case of understanding deep game mechanics, the game has an in game encyclopedia providing even detailed mathematical equations/formulas.

There is also a clear abhorrent of menus-within-menus and constant tedious micro management like constant use of vendor recipes or drag-dropping and switching mechanics like watchstones, scarabs, sextants. 

And designed to avoid clicking and wasting the players time as much as possible like constant re-rolls.

It also features a [b]deterministic crafting system[/b], frankly, the steam review limit is not enough for me to write about that alone.

So unlike Path of Exile, the overwhelming majority of gaming time is meant to be spend [b]ingame[/b], killing/looting stuff rather than constantly alt-tabbing to several browser pages, using external third party apps, crawling throughout tens of stash tabs and calculating percentages to create ""efficiency"".

Also, there are no real-money micro-transactions that provide quality of life stuff, like extra stash tabs or premium stuff that enable or simplify basic gaming concepts like guilds, trading and visual clarity.

And regarding quality of life

Oh 
my 
god

The game is packed with those

If you come from Path of Exile, your wrist will constantly thank you as you play this game.
No flask piano or constantly holding/casting certain abilities (the devs are clearly against that, in terms of design and communication with players)

No unidentified items, no portal scrolls. (portal is a hotkey and items are meant to be constantly upgraded, even during leveling)

Vacuuming ""currency/craft materials"" and autostashing such loot with the click of a button, even outside a stash menu.
As well as a sorting button, both in inventory and stashes.

Its hilarious that this counts as a feature in 2021... but there is even a training dummy and death recap screen!

[b]VISUALS & SOUND[/b]

The game frequently changes tone and setting due to its ""time traveling"" theme. This creates a nice  frequent change of pace.

One moment you are an ancient colorful valley filled with dinosaurs, the other you are in a medieval abandoned town or a post apocalyptic distant future cave complex as humanity has retreated from the surface, seeking refuge down below.

Usually those locations are in the exact same locations set in different time eras and often you can't help but stop and admire visuals and background ""noise"". 

Game speed and visual clarity is at a comfortable place where you can understand whats going on the screen at all times and thats the most important thing in such fast paced games.

The animations especially for the most recent class (Rogue) are very snappy and precise, enemies have good telegraphs and very dangerous moves have very clear areas of effect.

The voice acting and sound design is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the game.

Its not always the case in the entirety of the game but I feel often the voice acting aproaches ""porn quality"".

The music can also be improved vastly, boss themes are reused too much and tracks have small durations, resulting in a repeating, boring ambience.

[b]STRUCTURE & LAST THOUGHTS[/b]

5 classes to choose from, 3 sub-classes to each one.

The level cap is 100, at around 25-30 you choose the subclass, the current ""endgame"" starts at lvl 50-60.

I strongly suggest that you just dive in, you don't need any outside information or build guide for even your first character.

Respeccing is easy and rather cheap, and [b]the only permanent option currently is the master class.[/b]

The game is a joy to play in both Softcore and Hardcore (permadeath) mode.

It does a wonderful job with pacing and introducing mechanics.

It does not insult your intelligence by making you use 1 or 2 abilities for hours, within minutes you will have plenty of choices and most importantly, you will be able to easily switch out and try new stuff on the fly without any significant costs or requirements.

There are obviously passive and skill trees but the game rewards correct movement/positioning and cooldown/resource management more than min maxing and game knowledge.

Managing such aspects and creating synergies such as ""your dash now create shadow clones that mimic your abilities"" is the bread & butter of the game.

If there is one drawback, the leveling is ""too easy"" coming from other games.",b intro b review character limit game top looter hack slash arpg review aimed familiar game comparison path exile

If you loved the mod, you will love this. Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.

Your main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.

OK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!! 

Alright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming ""HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!"" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. Is that some fruit on the ground? Oh lucky day! Pick up the fruit, dust off the mold, and take a bite. Feeling a little sick? It's probably nothing. Just keep moving...

Update as of June 5, 2014.

Thank you to all of you who have commented and voted on my review so far.  I have noticed a few similar questions and comments being repeatedly posted, so I am going to address some here.

1.  Does this game require ArmA II?  

No, it is a standalone game, which is different than the mod, that requires no other purchases.  When you buy the game, you can start playing immediately and after the full release.

2.  Will this game come out for the Mac?

The system requirements on the store page list the following operating systems: Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7 SP1.

Update as of June 5, 2015.

It's been a year since my last update and I felt it was time to do another one.

Not much has changed with the game and that has been greatly disappointing.  It came out with such promise but time passed and I have been soured over the fact that so little work has been done to it.  What happened, devs?  Is anyone working on it anymore?  Did you stop caring?  It sort of feels like you took the money and ran.  It saddens me because I still love the game but I cannot heartily recommend it like I once did.

Looking to buy this game?  Do your homework first.  Read the reviews.  If you don't mind an incomplete game, go for it.  Otherwise you'd be wise to save your money for another game.

I am keeping my original review up for now.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"This is by far the worst EA game, actually scratch that, just game in general.

If they literally carbon copied any fifa game it would have been 100 times better than this piece of shit. And that is so sad. EA is by far one of the worst companies right now.

If you are considering buying this game, please give your money to anything else, or maybe give money to the ANTI lobotomy association in hopes of the EA developers getting the help they deserve. This is by far the WORST game I have played in my life and it is really sad steam allows this pathetic idea that should've been swallowed made it to the platform. I hope EA goes under and the CEO's starve. This game is just horrible and should not have ever seen the light. EA losing the rights to FIFA was a sign from god to end this horrible excuse for a franchise, yet they could not see the massive letters in the sky saying PLEASE DO NOT PLAY.

703080,Planet Zoo,"[h1]The Planet is Your Zoo[/h1]

Update: 12/02/19 Big patch was released that fixed the crashes. Perfect thanks!

[b]Planet Zoo is a genre buster![/b] I enjoy mostly strat games, so that’s usually the angle through which I view most of the games I play. That said, many of my favorite games split genres. It is a city-builder’s dream. It is a simulation game to the core. I am unsure where to split hairs between city-builders and sandbox building games, but they are two different things. Planet Zoo can be described as both to some extent. Because of all these great angles from which to play, and an awesome set of core mechanics Planet Zoo becomes this Frankenstein monster of a game that just will not let go of you. 

I enjoy City Skylines immensely. But, I was NOT happy with the puny roller coaster and plop-able set pieces. I would have liked to construct the tracks, like with the trains and the metro, etc. Then there was Jurassic World. Though it is a good game and I like the dinos, it lacks in the complexity of a game like City Skylines. If you played Planet Coaster any at all, then you only get part of the picture of Planet Zoo. It goes much further. Planet Zoo is a deep simulation/ city (zoo) builder that runs in pause-able real-time, much like Plague Inc. But, all this does not tell you what Planet Zoo is like. It is just for comparison/ contrast. 

[b]Mechanics:[/b]
The game builds a set of about 76 species of beasts and insects of all kinds around a set of maps for each continent and biome. The devs did a great job of covering a variety of each larger family of animal… like antelope for instance. The player gets a big picture of how animal life changes for similar creatures living in different climates. Within the framework of maps and animals, I enjoy the following positives about the game mechanics: 

•	Selecting animals for breeding based on a set of 4 genetic traits
•	Trading in the market for the breeders you want from other players in Franchise mode
•	Sorting out offspring not needed for further breeding to sell or release into the wild
•	Creating a god-like creature… ok so the genetics are fun. You get the point.
•	Using the Zoopedia of info to determine what each animal needs to make it comfortable in the zoo… enough for them to breed more babies
•	Building a zoo and all the many details that make them fun places to visit
•	Watching all the adorable animals
•	Watching the ai guests act like animal lovers (This is so real!) 
•	All the little things like the protesters who show up like idiots if you mistreat the animals they love
•	Conducting the research to open up more alternatives to build better enclosures and prevent escapes 
•	Seeing inside the buildings… I love that. For example… look inside the hospital building to see your sick animals with the vet.
•	Watching the animals fight over dominance, mating, and space issues
•	I think they can die if you screw up enough. (I’ve never seen this happen, but they have gotten near death a couple times. 
•	Hiring, scheduling, and firing employees 
•	Routing traffic and roads
•	The game is filled with data, facts, and Science info about wildlife that can be selected for exhibition boards to educate your guests. 
•	This is not a game to play on fast speed and watch it run. If you aren’t paying close attention bad things happen, like your enclosure walls will collapse because those idiot mechanics are too slow getting around to repairing the walls. Then you know who to fire. It is a deep management sim. And, there is a good balance between managing the ai instead of micromanaging the work yourself. 
•	The music is beautiful and is a big sign to me of how special this game is to the development teams. When devs put a lot of effort into choosing the best soundtrack, it reveals the game as a work of heart. I appreciate that. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
There are some negatives to consider as well. But, I would rather play a slightly ‘unoptimized’ game that captivates me for a ridiculous number of hours than a perfectly average AAA game any day of the week. 

* The most fun is in Franchise mode which is online… dropped network connections can result in loss of connection to the servers 
*The Career Mode is a set of scenarios. They make an excellent tutorial. But, if you’re like many gamers you don’t really want to start there and only go there to pick up the achievies after figuring everything out on your own anyways. The difficulty level seems a bit in need of balancing. The first 3 are incredibly easy if you’ve already been playing in other modes. Then the 4th one throws you out there to design your own zoo from scratch… expecting you to have about ten different species & another 6 or so small exhibit insects. Not too bad if you have already been exploring like me, but expect mountainous taiga, snow, and very little usable space. And, they turn off the terraforming tools for good measure. Also, they limit the choice of available animals in the market to 12. So, you really have little choices there. That’s why I like the Franchise mode so much… choices. 
* Sometimes it seems things just won’t cooperate. For example… in a tutorial/ career mode I had finished all the requirements for gold in about an hour, except placing a single gift shop. It just wouldn’t let me place it. The pop up kept saying ‘wrong orientation.’ Finally, it allowed me to place it in backwards and I got the completion. Moments later it notified me the shop was backwards and allowed me to turn it around. 
* Another example… sometimes the terraforming tools seem to refuse to dig in spots. But, the tools are pretty freaking awesome. The mechanics are easy to learn. And, you can sculpt the earth into whatever shape you want. 
* The game was crashing when first loading into the game at first. Then the crash notification send button was stretched beyond all vision. So, you couldn’t hit the send button, and then it would vanish. But, the game would still be running in the background. I switched the game from the widescreen 5760X1080 resolution I use for triple monitors to playing it in windowed on the center screen only. That didn’t seem to help. The crash log was what was hanging the game up. So, basically just doing a control alt delete and stopping the crash log process in the task manager (because the game wouldn’t be there) would make the game stop immediately. Then relaunching would work fine.  But the last update seemed to solve this problem so far. 

[b]Suggestions:[/b] 
I can already see a few places where patches or dlc could add more to the game. 
•	It would be nice to see more visible variations in the animals, based on genetics
•	More animals. Yes there are many, but more is always a good thing. And, I only say this because I know they will give us more animals. It just makes good sense.
•	Even more terraforming tools. It’s kind of a limited toolbox atm.
•	Some of the awesome tables and data sets (like the market) need quality of life optimization so that you don’t have to input search parameters over and over every single search, for example. The sound effects here are very pleasing, by the way.
There are more I’ve thought of but can’t remember atm. I may add them later. I listed the nitpicky bugs to help the dev teams. The crash report didn’t seem to be doing its job (like a few ai mechanics.)

[b]TL;DR Conclusion:[/b] 
I highly recommend Planet Zoo for gamers of all ages. It is enjoyable and captivating and filled with fun Science stuff about animals of all kinds. It is workshop enabled, and integrates you into the community of zoo builders with many unique features, like allowing friends’ avatars to visit your zoo, and buying and selling animals from other players.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"For context, I play Ark mostly solo, always PvE. The concept of homesteading in a dino-based survival world is why Ark appealed to me and I always wished the game would be more accessible to a casual solo player. I hope this review can help people with a similar play style decide if they should buy it :)

The game is essentially a remaster. The main change is the graphics. The game is stunningly pretty, even on lower settings. Wildcard also say they made improvements under the hood for optimisation, I think this is what comes with changing over to UE5 because it still needs a strong GPU and careful tweaks to run well. The graphical changes do really help with the immersion, which is a big appeal for someone like me, playing for a relaxing, dino taming time rather than PvP. I can imagine the performance is pretty frustrating for PvP players. 

In Ark Evolved, my biggest frustrations were feeling locked out of content, the janky and unappealing UI and some of the odd mechanics. Does Ascended fix these things? Yes and No. 

There is more respect for your time now. The difficulties are easier to set up for single player and the overall SP mode feels more balanced. The building mechanics really help with this too, with changes such as being able to pick up anything you've placed indefinitely and just general QoL with building that actually means I can try things out without feeling I've wasted a lot of time for nothing. I feel like breeding projects are more accessible, as the changes to mutations make it less time consuming to make pretty and powerful tames.

The UI looks a bit sleeker now and less like a placeholder, although there are still frustrating things like not being able to see all craftable items in the smithy for example. The UI still feels janky to me, I was hoping that some design improvements would happen to make it a little more intuitive. They've made some mechanics work more intuitively though. Radius effects for water and energy is a big change that makes building a bit more accessible in some regards. All the extra paints are really nice for the creatively minded player too :) 

But there are still loads of bugs. I crash lots sometimes, other times not. I've died randomly and not had a death marker or my stuff drop, it's just... gone. The game has some odd issues with spawns and there are years old bugs that have made their way over from evolved. There hasn't been much acknowledgement of these problems either. 

The game also feels a bit empty at the moment because the DLC stuff isn't included yet, so it's a very bare-bones Ark experience. It's nice to start a little slow and know there's more to come, but it's worth mentioning as it could be a deal breaker for some. 

I still recommend this game, but only because dinosaurs. It fills a special void in my brain and I have such a love hate relationship with the game, but there's nothing else like it out there. Ascended's changes have meant for me, the game is a little closer to the chill dinosaur homesteading game I craved at the time of ASE. I will put lots of hours into it, I am sure but make no mistake, this game is flawed.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. 

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.

But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.

As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. 

I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.

But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. 

I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!",review wrote one probably serious one wrote starter community game suck like every online game wan na talk jerk wan na say suck camped blah blah blah rare get nice compliment people game talk community either unlike online game one mic system worry hearing twelve year old cry baby raging nothing time talk people game beginning match start survivor end match killer survivor end chat one killer talk everyone match though mostly say gg good game survivor basically play every man sneaky say screw player try good team mate rescue get hook someone jerk chat match know save get hooked mostly play killer find fun playing survivor someone got ta play killer hear people enjoy playing survivor probably becuase survivor feel like horror game get team mate killer really trying say game really great even though community suck ignore community get someone raging end say gg leave seeing make argue waste time might make even mad even got last word aka gg give game 8 10 wonder anyone actually read review actually take time write wan na swear see nothing censor heart steam like actually read let know leaving comment like someone read peice crap review yay

397540,Borderlands 3,"[h1]Borderlands 3 is a good game, ruined by the greed of 2K and Pitchford.[/h1]
I want to preface this review with the fact that I really enjoyed Borderlands 3, FAR MORE than I did with any other Borderlands game. I adored both the shooting and RPG elements of BL3, I think it's the best in the series. I get what I want in Borderlands the most in BL3, fun and insane guns. The close range explosive Flakker, the laser pistol Lightshow, the slot machine integrated gun Lucky 7, and the gun that shoots fucking burgers are all inventions of madmen and I love them. The playable characters are also the best in the series. Multiple action skills allow for you to have 4 BL2 characters in a single BL3 Vault Hunter. There's no real generic gun man (like Axton, Roland, and Wilhelm) and all of them can be played in unique methods. Endgame is also significantly better than BL2's, as Mayhem levels don't require an hour long investment and all of them are free to you in an instant. A final note that a lot of people are sleeping on, you only have to do a single playthrough per character to experience all the content in the game! Honestly dread starting new characters in Borderlands 2, because a max level character entails visiting Sawtooth Cauldron 3 times.

Now why is this review negative? Let's start off with the apparent reasons that are actually in the game. The UI is nauseating, the mini-maps are an actual challenge to navigate due to how they factor in different floor levels and how they constantly rotate. The same mini-map will look drastically different from itself if you just move up a staircase and face the other way. Also, it is not my expertise to say why, but BL3 has terrible optimization and even the highest end pcs will experience stutters over very little. But the most offending factor of BL3 would be the game's writing. The main story has some of the worst writing I've seen in a AAA game. Ava is probably one of my least favorite characters from this decade. She is a literal child that constantly whines and learns nothing, but for some reason gets the keys to the Crimson Raiders thrown her way. And don't even get me started on the Calypso twins. Living up to Handsome Jack is a very difficult task, but they were miles away from ever achieving that. Tyreen's motivations are the generic ""I want power for the sake of it"" villain trope and Troy exists for a buildup to nothing. If you want a more detailed explanation on the faults of BL3's story, I highly recommend Cartoonshi's video on the topic.

What I care most about however is the numerous shoddy business practices of 2K and Randy Pitchford. BL3 is a $60 game with another $80 worth of DLC in its 2 season passes. The $115 asking price for all the game's content is baffling to me and I cannot justify that cost for any video game. Not to mention the fact that a second season pass betrays the promise that season pass holders get all future DLC content. Oh and there was also the Epic Games Exclusive deal. A complete lack of care for their consumers by locking the game behind an inferior storefront. The money from said deal didn't even go to the developers, but rather the greedy executives as Gearbox devs never received their promised bonuses after the game sold 5 million copies. This combined with the allegations of assault and severe underpay from the former Claptrap voice actor really lead me to believe that Gearbox is a talented studio held back by their money-grubbing publishers. I genuinely hope Gearbox will be able to stand without 2K someday.

As a TLDR: I love BL3, it's a very fun game with some flaws in UI, optimization, and writing. But I find the toxic work environment of 2K, underpaying of employees, and the anti-consumer business practices make it very hard for me to recommend anyone to get it. 2K is a company up there with EA with their abuse and greed and I hope that less people support them.",h1 borderland 3 good game ruined greed 2k pitchford h1 want preface review fact really enjoyed borderland 3 far borderland game adored shooting rpg element bl3 think best series get want borderland bl3 fun insane gun close range explosive flakker laser pistol lightshow slot machine integrated gun lucky 7 gun shoot fucking burger invention madman love playable character also best series multiple action skill allow 4 bl2 character single bl3 vault hunter real generic gun man like axton roland wilhelm played unique method endgame also significantly better bl2 mayhem level require hour long investment free instant final note lot people sleeping single playthrough per character experience content game honestly dread starting new character borderland 2 max level character entail visiting sawtooth cauldron 3 time review negative let start apparent reason actually game ui nauseating mini map actual challenge navigate due factor different floor level constantly rotate mini map look drastically different move staircase face way also expertise say bl3 terrible optimization even highest end pc experience stutter little offending factor bl3 would game writing main story worst writing seen aaa game ava probably one least favorite character decade literal child constantly whine learns nothing reason get key crimson raider thrown way even get started calypso twin living handsome jack difficult task mile away ever achieving tyreen motivation generic want power sake villain trope troy exists buildup nothing want detailed explanation fault bl3 story highly recommend cartoonshi video topic care however numerous shoddy business practice 2k randy pitchford bl3 60 game another 80 worth dlc 2 season pass 115 asking price game content baffling justify cost video game mention fact second season pas betrays promise season pas holder get future dlc content oh also epic game exclusive deal complete lack care consumer locking game behind inferior storefront money said deal even go developer rather greedy executive gearbox devs never received promised bonus game sold 5 million copy combined allegation assault severe underpay former claptrap voice actor really lead believe gearbox talented studio held back money grubbing publisher genuinely hope gearbox able stand without 2k someday tldr love bl3 fun game flaw ui optimization writing find toxic work environment 2k underpaying employee anti consumer business practice make hard recommend anyone get 2k company ea abuse greed hope le people support

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"This review will be removed if and when the issues I'm going to write about has been addressed by Rockstar Games,

Currently GTA:Online for PC has next to no serious attention from Rockstar Games on the topic of anti-cheat, anti-grief, anti-mod within GTA:Online. and as of today (day of writing) It has come under my attention that Rockstar has failed to properly protect the personal information, location details, IP addresses and other information of its users. Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson. 

Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname.

Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years. 

I will leave a youtube video about this topic here: https://youtu.be/UK1vLaHtgec and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following.

Personal accounts with this issue:
I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together. 

Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes.

EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it.

Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike?
A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better.

Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk?
A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit.

Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video?
A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including:

Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this.
A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data.

Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me?
A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision

Owlcat is very good at being a rogue trader. They release games that you fall in love with but when you get about 40hrs in you start to release they you have been suckered. Their first game Pathfinder was epic until you got to the 3rd chapter. After that you realize that you are now a beta tester. The same thing happened with Pathfinder 2. I thought it was just tough luck, but this game again demonstrates their incompetence.

Im getting close to 100hrs and Im struggling to finish the story. They excel at story telling. However, just like the Pathfinder games everything went to crap after the 3rd chapter. For our convenience they have a little icon of a bug on the corner of the screen so we can be their beta testers. Basically, if you buy this game right now you are paying them to be a beta tester. 

Just like their other games, I’m sure this game will be great in a year. I really want to love this game. I spent about 30hrs reading all the lore that’s in the game. I’m invested and I’m still struggling to get to the end. I just wish I did not have to hack the game to get there.

105600,Terraria,"How have I not written a review for this amazing game?
I've been playing Terraria ever since the days of early 1.1.1, in the Christmas season of 2011. Over these years, I've logged just about 2000 hours total, along with another 1000 hours played offline. Enough showing off though. Why in the world should you buy this game?

Terraria is an experience where you're given basically unlimited liberty. Even before you start, you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all up, you get dropped into the center of the overworld, where you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I did, don't worry, as Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges. 

You can even get a vastly different experience, cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steam, you just open up your world from the Multiplayer menu, and send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third party accounts!

If your class specific challenges and multiplayer options can't fill your needs, there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are 2 of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progression, while Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separately, those 2 add so much on their own, but there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.

Back to the base game, the music is absolutely outstanding, and along with the ambient noises, the game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...

Bosses can be difficult to fight (especially in Expert, and soon, in Master Mode), but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazing, each one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizable, even allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any), and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360 degree hookshot, and the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook (jumping) early to launch yourself with some huge momentum (then, if you're like me, doing it again immediately in the opposite direction, and repeating). Mobility might be really slow, and to be honest, a bit boring at the start of the game (in Normal Mode, at least), but it greatly improves as you make progress.

Lastly, the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Server, if you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer. There are many things I didn't cover here, but I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this game, and I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;P

Sorry, my train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this far, and I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :D

230410,Warframe,"I'm bored of this game. I can barely play it. A lot of the new content is more of the same. This is a common theme between veterans, as you can see from several negative reviews from people with 1k+ hours into the game.

HOWEVER...

If someone played a game for this many hours and stopped because of the lack of content, it's not due to the game being unfun. The average player will find the game quite entertaining for the most part. There's just too high of an expectation of being able to play a game 10 hours a day and not get burnt out.

It's an amazing game. By the time you are bored, you'll have spent more time in this game than you'd ever have on several ""AAA"" titles combined. And it's free. The monetization is absolutely fair (and extremely cheap). Seriously, if you get a 75% discount on one of the Daily Rewards (not an uncommon reward), any plat purchased will net so much value and for a long period of time.

216150,MapleStory,"For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.

Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.

But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions. 

As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".

Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did.",claification sake played game since beta love overall animation playstyle imaged 2d platformer guess really hit nostalgia nerve yearning old mario brother mechanic hate bash something fell love longer game use know back early day maplestory 4 standard class mage warrior archer thief mage warrior 3 subset archer thief 2 subset finding equipment hanging friend easy server many map level cap set crazy 200 mindless grinding bad cause could easily friend found equip use one could vice versa maplestory grew surface would think good thing people friend equips true nexon saw excellent opportunity milk player microtransactions game grew nexon built server map creating virtual spacial rift player became difficult get map friend without using teleport rock microtransaction item wasting bunch time nexon created pet vanity item world transfer shop real money enough created character type share cash shop item original character essentially urging player rebuy cash item new character also lead nerfing original character guise improved rebalancing issue nexon raised level cap 250 milking player even longer created lottery system called gachapon game item using real money mention special event lottery play maplestory use fun sucked waste ton time money like
1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"One of the best single player story MMOs out there. FYI, this is a review from a mostly solo player viewpoint. I've been playing this game very on and off since day 1, so I've seen how it's changed and progressed over the years. Unlike other MMOs, this one has only gotten better with age. There is literally hundreds of hours of single player story content, with solo dungeons and raids for you to do in case you're like me and enjoy playing solo. If you're like me and stopped playing WoW bc of various reasons, I can recommend this game very much.

Combat is your standard tab target MMO, but there is an emphasis on player control. By that I mean, you can have a handful of companions that join you and be your tank, dps, or heals. You also can heal yourself at any time, which makes solo content fun. I'm still shocked at how all the non force classes play so well and fit into this SW story so well. I personally like the Smuggler and Bounty Hunter classes the most. You get your own ship, base, and crew that you can deck out how you like.

The story is the best part of this game. You have 8 classes (4 Republic, 4 Empire), and all have their own 20 to 30 hour story, depending on how much side content you do. Choices matter and can affect the game in smaller ways. The game makes you feel like you're the champion of each class. You start small then get bigger and bigger in the story.  If you're wanting KOTOR 3, then this is what you need to play. The story is a sequel to KOTOR 2 (loosely), so you'll see certain characters reappearing or being mentioned. 

The game is F2P, but you're very limited with what you can do if you don't pay. Others have said this, but it's best to sub for just 1 month and then you get put on a preferred status even if you aren't paying anymore, so you still have access to certain features that F2P (never subbed) can't use. The Cartel Market is their cash shop, but there's no P2W features. It's almost all cosmetics, mounts, boosters. But all of these can be still purchased in the in game trade market for high prices. But it's up to you. The game is also new player friendly, with giving you a lot of early tutorials and goodies to show off what you can do right now and at higher levels. 

Over all, I think in 2021 SWTOR is up there with FF14 in terms of single player content. I don't do any PVP or hardcore raiding, so I can't comment on that part. If you're jonesing for KOTOR 3, realistically you're never going to get it, but this game is about as close to it as we'll ever see. Just do like me and play it solo and just pretend the other players aren't there. :)",one best single player story mmos fyi review mostly solo player viewpoint playing game since day 1 seen changed progressed year unlike mmos one gotten better age literally hundred hour single player story content solo dungeon raid case like enjoy playing solo like stopped playing wow bc various reason recommend game much combat standard tab target mmo emphasis player control mean handful companion join tank dp heals also heal time make solo content fun still shocked non force class play well fit sw story well personally like smuggler bounty hunter class get ship base crew deck like story best part game 8 class 4 republic 4 empire 20 30 hour story depending much side content choice matter affect game smaller way game make feel like champion class start small get bigger bigger story wanting kotor 3 need play story sequel kotor 2 loosely see certain character reappearing mentioned game f2p limited pay others said best sub 1 month get put preferred status even paying anymore still access certain feature f2p never subbed use cartel market cash shop p2w feature almost cosmetic mount booster still purchased game trade market high price game also new player friendly giving lot early tutorial goody show right higher level think 2021 swtor ff14 term single player content pvp hardcore raiding comment part jonesing kotor 3 realistically never going get game close ever see like play solo pretend player
648800,Raft,"Raft is a relaxing, occasionally zen-like experience as you bob on the open ocean, collecting resources, crafting goodies, both practical and cosmetic, and expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining ship, occasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear (he deserved it) or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird (you deserved it). The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them well-tuned, and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed. There's even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it. There's an excellent balance between the peaceful sea-faring and island exploring and occasionally battling. With the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded, although it's still unfinished and development seems very slow. 

[h1]Bring a ""friend"" as shark bait[/h1]

The biggest benefit of Raft to me is the seamless co-op. Hosted on a local machine, your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you. If you should want to let them progress without you, which I have done a few times, you can easily send them the file to load. It's not quite as good as it being persistently online, but it's easy enough. I played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together, assigning jobs and positions, working as a team to explore the ocean and the land, baiting the shark away from the others, tucking unconscious bodies into bed, you know, all the sorts of things friends do for each other.

[h1]Chest Wars[/h1]

However, I will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories, painstakingly labelled with signs, and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box, or scuba gear into my food box. In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it. It staved off divorce. I also got yelled at a few times for re-arranging the rooms, but really, these guys have no interior design skills! Look I'm type A okay, I need order on my boat, even in the apocalypse.

[h1]What's bad?[/h1]

The main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on. It's getting there, but no one knows when it'll pass the finish line and you're just hoping it doesn't have a heart attack en route. I'm patiently waiting, but I do wish the full experience was ready. It's come a long way from release, but I can't help but feel there's still a ways to go.

Despite the snail-like development, I've really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patch, so it gets a thumbs up from me.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"So I played this game when it first came out. It was enjoyable, but nothing to keep me playing for a long time. I sat on it for a while and just recently came back to see how it is. I still feel the same way. 

Graphics are great in my opinion. Trees, grass, water, animals, and even the people all look amazing. So A plus in this area. 

Gameplay is where I feel this takes a major hit. I played 20 something hours back in the day and within the last 2 weeks I have play another 25 hours. This is on standard 3 day seasons. I am just into Year 3 Winter Season now and am still crafting 100 stone knives to make the money required for taxes. My yearly taxes for Year 3 was 1500 coins and next year will be more because I've produced more fields and houses. Yet even with all my extraction, citizens, and production I can not find a more profitable path than the simply production of stone knives. I can make a Stone Knife for 2 stone and 5 sticks. Which I can normally collect enough of this to create 40 knives just on a simple walk to a village. Actually roaming around would take me a little less than half the (in game) day to produce over 100 knives. These all sell at 28 coins a piece. If went out and made Instant Heal Potions I would only net about 30 coins per bottle. Simply to make 1 Potion of Instant Healing you require 1 wooden vial, 2 Broadleaf, 2 dandelion, and 1 bucket with at least 1 water in it. To make the wooden vial I require at least a stone axe (10 sticks 2 stones) and a Woodshed (requiring logs, stone, and straw) and the purchase of the scheme for it. In all just getting to a point of making the healing potion costs over 1000 coins. If i have these made within my city I can produce 1 per day at 25% rate or 4 per day at 100% production. 240 coins or 1440 coins in a YEAR. While making 100 stone knives produces me 2800 gold in less than a day. This in my opinion is crazy and it goes toward everything you can make within the game. 

For the most part all created items cost and amazing amount just to have the schematic for, but then crazy amounts of resources to create that simply dont translate into decent time/resource/value ratio's. The game creates the amazing grind my making you sit there and funnel almost all the time into making money as well. I have a city bigger then every other town on the map. So i pay 1500 coins a year just for taxes. But beyond that, I dont have a pigsty effectively giving me enough manure for my fields. SO i have to buy that, even buying straight manure is exceptionally costly. Then i have to buy all my seeds each year. Why? Because there is no way to tell your population not to use all the damn grain for animal feed. So when the planting season comes up they are out of grain. 

Production in some buildings is insane micromanaging as well. If make an Herebalism hut, you are required at the start of every season to change what they are extracting. Because you are only allowed to put in 100% production and every season there are things they can get and things they can't. If i wanted to ensure not all my grain when to animal feed I would once again have to go into micro-managing my productions. It is overly tedious. 

Overall I love the idea of this game. I just don't enjoy the implementation. I assume the only reason for the grind is because the game really has nothing else going for it. Say you go out and don't harvest a thing for an entire year. What did you do? Basically all you could do is sit around your village and eat/drink (from produced items) so you don't die. There is nothing to explore, nothing that challenges your city, and in reality no real reason to play for extended periods of time. 

Final Thoughts:

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Edit on Class Overhaul Patch October 4th:
""The game has improved quite a bit with the past big update. Every class now has a good amount of variety in how you want to build around your character and playstyle. The addition of more difficult missions via Auric/Maelstrom is also appreciated. Balanced changes are mostly good too.

However, all of this should have been in the game from the very start. Not marking this game as an early access title is a clear indicator of Fatshark's greed for money. Crafting is still heavily reliant on RNG and its a slog to get a weapon you actually want. They increased the pricing on cosmetics along with ""screwing"" over the PC playerbase by providing way more Aquillas to Xbox players, while the community gets ""insulted"" by a CM for so called ""pearl clutching"".

All in all, the game has made more steps forward than back. This is one of the best horde shooter, set in the Warhammer 40k universe. So if you are into that, you might consider a buy. BUT I WON'T be changing it to a positive review because of all the lies and false pretenses FS brought to light. I just can't bring myself to support this kind of marketing. Even after all the hours i sunk into this game.""

>It doesn't need a 5th class like vermintide on launch
>It doesn't need 2nd and 3rd careers like vermintide on launch
>It doesn't need crafting like vermintide on launch
>It doesn't need the promo outfits
>It doesn't need enemies shown in trailers
>It doesn't need to run at >30 fps even on 30 series cards
>It doesn't need their PR to post outside of their discord
>It doesn't need to be finished on ""launch""
>It doesn't need basic mob patrols
>It doesn't need better spawning
>It doesn't need a scoreboard
>It doesn't need penances not to require griefing entire team

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"It's a good game, but its not great. DL1 was 100% better than this game, and its pretty disappointing. The parkour is better in DL2, and is very fun, but in basically every other department (story, combat, atmosphere, etc), DL1 is just so much better. DL2's combat is fun, don't get me wrong, but it just feels so... empty. In DL1, I used to run around (even at max level in power and legend) and kill zombies for an hour, because it was fun to just mindlessly kill zombies. The combat felt weighty and (semi) realistic, it wasn't perfect, but it was perfect for a game like DL1. In DL2, I actively avoid all forms of combat. It just doesn't feel as good as DL1. Human combat is better, but it still feels kinda weird. 

On top of that, the zombies themselves in DL2 don't feel good at all to fight against. They just walk towards you, take you hits without retaliating, they don't feel even close to as reactive as DL1's zombies. In DL1, the zombies stumbled towards you, as you hit them, your weapon rebounded off of them, as if they're an actual person (in DL2, you slash/strike straight through them, as if you just slightly grazed them, DL1 feels better because it actually feels as if you're slashing/hitting a person/zombie with a weapon, it doesn't phase through them), and if you got too many hits in or got too close, they would grab you or push you away. The zombies actively felt like they wanted to kill you, they were much more reactive (ragdolls were also one the main reasons that the enemies felt so realistic/dynamic in DL1). The gore also felt better, mostly due to DL2 having health bars and levelling systems for combat, which makes it feel like you're not fighting a zombie to kill them, rather that you're trying to deplete their health bar (dismemberment/decapitations only really happen on the last hit an enemy can take or if you get a crit, with a health bar always being above a zombie, it constantly reminds you that you have x amount of hits until you can kill the enemy/zombie, making it seem much less dynamic). 

Also, DL1 had much, much better atmosphere. Harran was great, the slums had a murky and gritty atmosphere, it felt depressing, but great. Old Town felt more refined, and had better rooftop parkour, but still kept the atmosphere that the slums had. Villedor and the Central Loop in DL2 is great, but its missing the atmosphere that the Slums and Old Town had. You could hear the screams of virals in the distance as you run from rooftop to rooftop, as you narrowly avoid zombies below you. The atmosphere in DL1's maps was very palpable, but DL2 doesn't really have that. The maps feel static, and they don't feel alive whatsoever, it just feels like a playground for parkour (which they did very well in that regard, the Central Loop is extremely fun to parkour in). Also, DL1's nights were significantly scarier, the first in DL1, nights were genuinely terrifying. In DL2, you can casually stroll around at night (even at street level), and its not even tense; you can escape chases so easily its not even funny. The only way you can get a high level chase is if you go out of your way to purposefully start it. 


The zombies took a backseat in DL2. It feels less like a zombie game, and more like a post-apocalyptic game with zombies added in there for some background noise. The people in DL2's world don't feel oppressed by zombies, nor concerned by them. In DL1, you could feel how zombies had a real impact on the world and how they were an actual threat to humans; random events of people being attacked by zombies, people in the story and in safe-zones actually talking about zombies and how they pose a real threat to them (like Brecken's night mission that went wrong, you had to set up traps for the night mission to avoid the dangerous zombies/volatiles at night, the game gave you a first hand example of how zombies are dangerous in this world, especially at night, something DL2 doesn't do), and stuff like that. DL2 doesn't really have any of that. 

The story is honestly just not good. The characters, at least to me, were more irritating than anything (especially Lawan). It felt nonsensical at times, and it felt like a slog to progress through. DL1's story, while not great in any way, I still think its better. It felt more serious and realistic (ish), I was genuinely intrigued in the story and I cared for the characters (I didn't care a lot or even moderately, but I certainly cared a lot more for DL1's characters than the characters in DL2). 

Despite the pretty negative things I've said about DL2, I still think its an okay game. I personally (and a lot of other people) think its a step down from DL1 in most departments, but the parkour and world is something to be experienced.",good game great dl1 100 better game pretty disappointing parkour better dl2 fun basically every department story combat atmosphere etc dl1 much better dl2 combat fun get wrong feel empty dl1 used run around even max level power legend kill zombie hour fun mindlessly kill zombie combat felt weighty semi realistic perfect perfect game like dl1 dl2 actively avoid form combat feel good dl1 human combat better still feel kinda weird top zombie dl2 feel good fight walk towards take hit without retaliating feel even close reactive dl1 zombie dl1 zombie stumbled towards hit weapon rebounded actual person dl2 slash strike straight slightly grazed dl1 feel better actually feel slashing hitting person zombie weapon phase got many hit got close would grab push away zombie actively felt like wanted kill much reactive ragdolls also one main reason enemy felt realistic dynamic dl1 gore also felt better mostly due dl2 health bar levelling system combat make feel like fighting zombie kill rather trying deplete health bar dismemberment decapitation really happen last hit enemy take get crit health bar always zombie constantly reminds x amount hit kill enemy zombie making seem much le dynamic also dl1 much much better atmosphere harran great slum murky gritty atmosphere felt depressing great old town felt refined better rooftop parkour still kept atmosphere slum villedor central loop dl2 great missing atmosphere slum old town could hear scream virals distance run rooftop rooftop narrowly avoid zombie atmosphere dl1 map palpable dl2 really map feel static feel alive whatsoever feel like playground parkour well regard central loop extremely fun parkour also dl1 night significantly scarier first dl1 night genuinely terrifying dl2 casually stroll around night even street level even tense escape chase easily even funny way get high level chase go way purposefully start zombie took backseat dl2 feel le like zombie game like post apocalyptic game zombie added background noise people dl2 world feel oppressed zombie concerned dl1 could feel zombie real impact world actual threat human random event people attacked zombie people story safe zone actually talking zombie pose real threat like brecken night mission went wrong set trap night mission avoid dangerous zombie volatile night game gave first hand example zombie dangerous world especially night something dl2 stuff like dl2 really story honestly good character least irritating anything especially lawan felt nonsensical time felt like slog progress dl1 story great way still think better felt serious realistic ish genuinely intrigued story cared character care lot even moderately certainly cared lot dl1 character character dl2 despite pretty negative thing said dl2 still think okay game personally lot people think step dl1 department parkour world something experienced

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.
Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.
I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. 

Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. 
You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.
The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.

I would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious. There are no useless areas in which you waste your time.

1627720,Lies of P,"[h1]A Love Letter To Die-hard Souls Fans, A Miserable Experience For Others[/h1]

Ah, the famous ""We have bloodborne at home."" And I can certainly say this game deserves the title. Bloodborne is its main inspiration, but the dev also takes in a bit of everything from the Souls series. There are Bloodborne's Rally and Dodge/Sidestep system, Sekiro's Parry system, Dark Souls 3's Weapon Art, Dark Souls' interconnected world design (the effort is there whether it's good or not), and finally, of course, the whole souls-like formula (stamina management, dodge roll enemy's attack, stab them in the rear, the usual stuff). That being said, Lies Of P also has some interesting twists to spice up the gameplay. Although most of them are welcoming additions, some decisions seem to drive a lot of players away, especially those who are not die-hard souls veterans but still FromSoft fans.

[h2]Things I Like About Lies Of P:[/h2]

[b]1. Weapon Parts Swapping System[/b]
This is the most interesting mechanic in the game. Every regular weapon you come across in Krat can be broken down into two parts: Blade and Handle. Blade dictates what type of damage and how much damage you are going to deal to the enemies, and Handle is responsible for both the movesets and scaling. Both parts also have different Fable Arts (weapon arts). Players can swap any blades and any handles to create their own comfort weapon. This is where the most blessed and cursed part comes in. You can create a custom weapon that negates its original flaw, like my personal favorite: Live Puppet's Axe Blade mixes with Exploding Pickaxe's Handle. This build mends the flaw of Puppet's Axe's slow and stamina-hungry attacks with much more enjoyable movesets and a way to reduce stamina consumption. And of course, you can also make the most cursed or useless weapon to torture yourself, like combining Fire Axe Blade with Police Baton Handle. By using this build, you will soon experience the saying ""Size does matter, and it matters a lot"".

[b]2. Other Compliments[/b]
→DO NOT sleep on throwables. They may not seem useful at first, but using them correctly can save you a lot of trouble.
→A lot of really cool weapons to play around with.
→Legion arms are fun to mix up with your playstyle.
→The in-game vinyl records have some nice tunes.
→Mini treasure hunts are rewarding.
→Live Puppet's Axe, my beloved.

[h2]Thing I Like And Dislike About Lies Of P:[/h2]

[b]Perfect Guard/Parry[/b]
It's basically the same with Sekiro. 
→[b]Like[/b]: I like Perfect Guard not only because of the satisfaction and the sound effect, but also because of the benefits that come with it. In Lies Of P, successfully pulling off a Perfect Guard yields two major advantages: stagger damage and weapon durability damage. When the former fills up, the enemy will become susceptible to execution with a fully-charged heavy attack or an Shot Put. The latter, when filled up, can destroy the enemy's weapon, which significantly reduces the damage that the enemy can deal, bosses included. 
→[b]Dislike[/b]: Yet, there is one thing that annoys me greatly in regards to Perfect Guard. Why does it still consume stamina when triggering Perfect Guard? I genuinely don't understand the reason behind the decision. The developer purposely makes Perfect Guard ""hard"" to do by giving enemies's delay attacks and fast-slow mix-ups. Plus, if you fail to parry, you get Deflect instead.  Deflect gives you grey health and, naturally, consumes stamina. I don't think players should still be punished after a successful parry.

[h2]Things I Dislike About Lies Of P:[/h2]

[b]1. Over-focusing On Precision In Both Playstyle[/b]
This game has the same problem as Thymesia, that it leans way too much into the precision aspect of Sekiro, but the problem with Lies Of P is more controversial. The game borrows the Parry system from Sekiro, at the same time, the Dodge system from Bloodborne which becomes Side-step when you lock on. Side-step is faster than Dodge, but the former has less i-frame. As a result, Side-step requires more reflexes to pull off. Can you see the problem here? Lies Of P introduces two precision-focus tools, which already demand a lot from the player, and on top of that, enemies have some of the longest and weirdest attack patterns in all the Souls-likes. These designs easily set the bar unreasonably high for regular players. Now personally, I don't mind it since I have been [strike]abused[/strike] I mean trained by the Souls series over the years. However, I can definitely see why the review tends to be polarizing, hence the title.

[b]2.  Other Complaints[/b]
→Stat description would be lovely since the developer rephrased all the keywords.
→Can we have the ""leveling up at a certain lady in the hub"" trend removed and just give us the level-up option as soon as possible?
→I wish you could farm Motivity Crank.
→Only Miyazaki San can get away with these many poisonous areas in a video game.

中文小簡評
→大概只有被宮崎英高調教過才玩得下去吧（讚美。
→木偶奇遇記+黑暗奇幻風+類魂玩法。
→基本上借鑒了許多老賊的遊戲，隻狼與血緣尤其甚多。
→當然在參考的基礎上增添了些自己創意。
→普通武器可以拆解成手把及刀身，手把決定攻擊架式及配點養成方向，刀身決定武器傷害及類型。玩家可以自由搭配，互相補足各種武器的優缺點，當然也可以配出幾乎是拿來搞笑的武器。

→搭配義手玩出更多花招。
→遊戲中的黑膠唱片都很好聽。
→人偶大斧我的最愛。
→完美架招能夠有效增加敵人體幹傷害，同時降低敵人武器耐久度，進而將其打壞，有效降低敵人傷害。
→令人不解的是為何完美架招還需要消耗體力，強度有、達成條件也夠苛刻，真的有必要再減少玩家追擊的機會嗎？
→這款遊戲真的是魂系死忠粉絲才會玩的開心（我是其中一位），我能想到的原因不外乎就是過份要求玩家精準度。前面有說到Lies Of P玩法參考最多的就是血緣及隻狼，血緣的墊步比翻滾快，無敵短，所以非常吃玩家反應，現在加上隻狼架招系統，及一大堆怪都有極其長且詭異的攻擊模組，不難想像這款有多容易勸退玩家。

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"It's been a long time since I found a game this immersive. At almost 100 hours, I've been cutting down trees, hunting deer and wild boar, chased through the forest at night by a pack of wolves, and scouring the ground for rocks as I build stone walls for my house. I've convinced people to join me by a lake in the mountains, in order to establish a small village. Now I've married and have a son who's in his fifth year, the heir to what I hope will be my dynasty. 

While there are certainly flaws to the game, the graphics are stunning and the music is beautiful. For a small, 15 person company, it's an amazing achievement. It's easy for me to forgive the somewhat confused technology tree that requires far too many levels in order to learn daub, even though you've already figured out how to build wattle ages ago. And somehow you can build a campfire, but not be able to add stones around it for several levels? Um... yeah.

But I absolutely love the game and have trouble pulling myself away for that humdrum thing we call ""reality."" Can't everyone see I have a half-built wattle and... well, wattle house to finish before nightfall, and a fuming villager waiting by the campfire? 

I've heard criticisms that this game doesn't look like the ""Middle Ages,"" but I think it's fine on that front. It looks about right for the EARLY Middle Ages. Say, around 800 or 900 CE. And it's clearly meant to be Poland (where the developers are located) or somewhere else in that region, where circular wooden fortresses were common, rather than the Late Middle Ages in England with armored knights stealing from and murdering the peasantry under the guise of ""Chivalry."" I do want to warn potential players that the hunting can be brutal. It's unpleasant to shoot an animal with bow and arrow, and before I acquired a bow, I had to kill deer with my hand axe. That method is nightmarish and bloody. Not as bad as it could be, I suppose, but still the poor thing gets covered in blood as it dies. I hate that. But I confess it adds to the realistic feel of the game.",long time since found game immersive almost 100 hour cutting tree hunting deer wild boar chased forest night pack wolf scouring ground rock build stone wall house convinced people join lake mountain order establish small village married son fifth year heir hope dynasty certainly flaw game graphic stunning music beautiful small 15 person company amazing achievement easy forgive somewhat confused technology tree requires far many level order learn daub even though already figured build wattle age ago somehow build campfire able add stone around several level um yeah absolutely love game trouble pulling away humdrum thing call reality everyone see half built wattle well wattle house finish nightfall fuming villager waiting campfire heard criticism game look like middle age think fine front look right early middle age say around 800 900 ce clearly meant poland developer located somewhere else region circular wooden fortress common rather late middle age england armored knight stealing murdering peasantry guise chivalry want warn potential player hunting brutal unpleasant shoot animal bow arrow acquired bow kill deer hand axe method nightmarish bloody bad could suppose still poor thing get covered blood dy hate confess add realistic feel game

703080,Planet Zoo,"[b] Overall Rating: 8.5/10 [/b]
(TL;DR at the end)

Okay, there's a lot to go over for this game. 
If you are the type of person who seriously enjoys simulation games that you think you'll only play for an hour or so and end up staying awake until 4 am, this is one of those games. From its endless amount of creative freedom to its beautiful graphics, Planet Zoo has become one of my top favorite games. 
I was an avid player of Zoo Tycoon 2 many years ago - had all of the expansion packs and spent hours upon hours managing my little animals and their little zoo. When I jumped into Planet Zoo, I was expecting a similar game. To put things short, Planet Zoo is its own ball game.

In Planet Zoo, you really get immersed in the whole zoo management system. There's so much that you have to keep in check while designing your zoo, but it's not so much to the point it becomes overwhelming. One moment you'll be making sure your animals have the correct environment in their enclosure, next you'll be making sure your staff have the correct balance of jobs (work zones saved my life on that one). The never-ending amount of creative freedom in this game provides endless opportunities for whatever your heart desires. If you're the type of person who doesn't like spending hours hand-designing shops, enclosures, etc, the Steam Workshop is filled with thousands of custom-made exhibits, decorations, anything you could dream of. On the other hand, if you are the type of person who likes to design things specifically how you like them, Planet Zoo offers endless chances to design whatever you want, however you want (to an extent). 

Now, the only reason I wouldn't give this game a 10/10 rating is due to some of the very poor development choices. Probably the most infuriating one that you'll see mentioned in plenty of other reviews is the path system. God, does the system need to be redone. It's extremely finicky at some times, and you are guaranteed to end up with little gaps in your walkways while designing your zoo. The only way to combat these is either using the grid system for your paths or filling the small gaps with decorations, but otherwise, you just have to suffer through it. Another major development issue is that zookeepers will quite literally let some animals starve to death. If your animals have certain enrichment items in their enclosures, the keepers register that as being food and will avoid feeding the animals. If you're seriously concerned about game bugs, I'd recommend reading multiple in-depth reviews, as some explain them better than I can. IMO, the game is most enjoyable in sandbox mode, since the majority of bugs can be worked around through the creative settings.

If you're seriously considering buying Planet Zoo, please put in the patience and wait for a sale. Yes, the game is extremely enjoyable, but with what the cons and expansion packs entail, I wouldn't rush to buy the game at full price.

TL;DR: Planet Zoo is a stunning simulation game that lets your creativity run wild. Hype aside, it has some extremely frustrating bugs and game mechanics.

- Fluid, satisfying combat system with excellent weight feeling and good mechanical variety.

- Generous amount and variety of worthwhile side-activities, quests and challenges.

- Good amount of mutually-exclusive choices during the story that have a tangible impact on the events.

- Some memorable characters, despite others being much less well-developed or interesting.

- Idiotic co-op progression, that doesn’t allow clients to correctly receive unique rewards and upgrade tools like the host does.

- Enormous quantity of bugs, technical problems, lack of polishing in all departments.

- Finicky, inaccurate parkour system that proves more frustrating than fun.

- Unbalanced progression causes huge power creep, players become overpowered way too soon even on the hardest setting.

- Huge materials grind is required if you want to upgrade a decent amount of gadgets, mods and tools.

- Almost all bosses are anonymous, boring, tediously-designed. Low-effort works that rarely feel memorable, if at all.

- Some debatable lore bending was done in order to accommodate certain gameplay elements, the reason for which clashes with the baseline lore established in DL1.

[td]It took me about 60 hours to complete DL2 on Hard difficulty, while also clearing the majority of side-quests, POIs and such. Some replay value can be found in siding with a different faction and/or making other choices during critical story moments.[/td]

[td][b]Is it worth buying?[/b][/td]
[td]No. The content offered may be fair for the 60€ price, considering the AAA production value - however, the quality just doesn’t meet the expectations. DL2 just has too many bugs and bizarre design choices to warrant a purchase at this time.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Premise, Setting & Writing[/h3]
The deadly virus introduced in the first chapter has inevitably spread to the four corners of the Earth, leaving Villedor as the last standing city, held in a fragile stalemate between two rivaling factions: Peacekeepers and Survivors. Playing as Aiden, one of the fabled Pilgrims who dare travel the world despite it being ravaged by Infected hordes, players will enter Villedor to find answers about the protagonist’s long-lost sister, Mia. Inevitably, Aiden’s path will intersect with one of these factions and for the better or worse, shape their future.

DL2 succeeds at recreating a post-apocalyptic city littered with ramshackle outposts, where water is a luxury, death is a daily occurrence, and banditry or violence become commonplace. Aiden’s actions in helping neutral survivors or faction members will dynamically change the shape of the city: help the militaristic PKs and see more and more fortified outposts rise, their forces patrol the streets. People will talk about your deeds, or loathe you should your reputation with their faction be low. Most side quests are worth doing but not as interesting lore-wise, they’re rarely exciting despite some choices present in them that may bar further quest lines or open new ones.

The lore doesn’t stay entirely faithful to DL1, as in order to justify a “no-firearms” gameplay, some debatable concessions have been made; only 15 years passed, and apparently everyone lost any knowledge about making bullets or guns - despite their ability to fabricate explosives on the regular. This just doesn’t make sense, and it’s just one of the many non-sequiturs present in the lore.

[h3]Exploration & Parkour[/h3]
Divided in two large districts, Villedor houses a great amount of POIs to explore, quests, challenges, looting spots - the works. Parkour will be your main means of moving around - until much later at least, when tools like the Hook or the Paraglider become available. Wall-running, climbing and dashing your way through rooftops will be a regular thing - and a frustrating one, given how imprecise and finicky this system is half the time. It’s fun when it works properly, but seldom does. 

Progressively clearing structures such as power stations, metro hubs, windmills and GRE zones will grant a bounty of perks and bonuses like Fast Travel spots, Inhibitors to boost your stats, experience in the Combat / Parkour disciplines so that you can gain useful passive perks, and of course rare weapons or materials for crafting and selling. Some areas can only be cleared at night, which puts you on the clock, since staying without IV exposure too long will trigger an instant death - too bad the game provides you with way too many healing items, so that this becomes a non-issue just a couple hours in.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2778006077

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
Mostly melee-based, despite having some ranged options (bows) and gadgets (grenades, mines, etc.), DL2’s combat focuses on stamina management, precisely-timed parries or dodges in order to stagger enemies - thus making them vulnerable - and the use of Aiden’s parkour skills to perform spectacular (but mostly redundant) moves like drop-kicks, throws and more - Smackdown vs. RAW anyone? In the end, combat against humans and infected is well-diversified and you’ll need separate approaches for each - there’s stealth too in case you’re a fan, and it’s pretty damn good especially in clearing dangerous areas like GRE Zones packed with enemies to the brim.

With plentiful gore, solid feedback and a decent variety of murder tools, status effects and enemy types combat has all the card to be satisfying - and it is when at the appropriate level. Too bad the progression makes you ridiculously overpowered way too fast, especially if you’re the type that does all side-content before continuing the main quest. You’ll be 2-3 levels (which is a lot) higher than most enemies by halfway through the game, thus making it a cake-walk. At some point you’ll even be able to roam at night, a dangerous affair, and steamroll the dangerous Volatiles and Special Infected hordes - which normally you should be scared to death of. 

[h3]Character Progression[/h3]
Aiden will progressively acquire new gear in the form of armor and weapons, the latter moddable with modules that may inflict status effects on hit, add durability, and a whole lot of other perks. Armor is divided into sets (Tank, Medic, Ranged…), most of which aren't too useful with their passive stats, only a few are actually the way to go, so forget about build diversity most of the time. You’ll also gain Stat and Perk points to enhance Aiden, making him learn new abilities and increasing max Health or Stamina, essential to reach many places he’s too weak to get to initially.

238960,Path of Exile,"I've been a Diablo fan pretty much my entire gaming life.  One of my earliest childhood gaming memories was saving up my allowance to buy Diablo 2.  I played D2 for years, I preordered the collector's edition of Diablo 3 and stayed up all night on launch night to play it, and since then I've put thousands upon thousands of hours into playing it.  Why am I talking about Diablo 3 in a PoE review?

Because two months ago I was in a slump, trying to find a new game to catch my interest, and I decided to finally try PoE.  Now I honestly think I might never play Diablo 3 again.  PoE is a true spiritual successor to Diablo 2.  Diablo 3 went in a new direction, making the game more casual and spectacle-focused, and dropping some of the more complex and esoteric RPG mechanics.  I liked this, and I certainly don't think it was a mistake for Diablo 3.

But PoE found the perfect medium place between Diablo 3's smooth/satisfying but somewhat shallow style, and Diablo 2's clunkier but more complex and deep style.

PoE is very complex on the surface.  There's no standard currency so you've got dozens of different types of ""orbs"", all of which are used for trading and for crafting in a variety of different ways.  There's no standard ""classes"", instead PoE's version of classes mostly determine where you start on the enormous and daunting ""passive tree"".

But take the time to get over the initial learning hurdle to demystify the game mechanics, and you're rewarded with an incredibly deep game with a much more fleshed-out endgame compared to Diablo 3, and nearly infinite build complexity.

Like Diablo and any other ARPG, PoE is fundamentally about the classic grindy gameplay loop of ""kill monsters to acquire gear to increase your power so you can kill higher level monsters to get more gear to increase your power level more etc etc etc"".  The trick to these games is to have a wide variety of different builds and playstyles so people can keep grinding without feeling bored.  PoE delivers this in spades.

The class system with the passive tree, Ascendancy classes that you unlock via in-game challenge puzzle levels, and other decisions you make in the campaign that effect your character allow for an insane level of complexity, without even addressing the gear.  Want to be a spellcaster, but who focuses almost exclusively on melee attacks?  You can do that.  Want to be a physical brute that focuses on summoning minions?  You can do that too.  Just about any combination you can imagine can be made, though obviously there's no guarantee it'll be any good.

Add to this the gearing system with it's skill gem sockets/links, and the actual gear itself with all the incredibly deep and complex crafting mechanics, and you can make a truly mind-boggling array of different characters.  Coming from Diablo 3 where there's usually about a dozen or maybe two dozen ""good"" builds in any given season, I was flabbergasted by PoE where you can easily find hundreds if not more.  The difficulty isn't in finding a decent build, it's in picking one amongst so many options.

PoE has a trading system, which is a double-edged sword.  On one hand it's really nice to be able to skip the RNG and just trade for the particular item you want.  I love being able to start a new alt, and use currency farmed from my previous characters to quickly just purchase everything my new character needs.  That being said, some rarer items will be almost impossible to afford, especially at the start.  This means that some builds will simply be ""too expensive"" for you to play, which is something that Diablo 3 doesn't have.  Though the more you play the more you make, so eventually everything becomes affordable enough.

PoE is truly Free to Play, but don't let that fool you.  You WILL be pressured into paying.  The game MOSTLY sells cosmetics which are absurdly priced (dozens of dollars for a single cosmetic item, yikes!), but the real kicker is that they sell stash space.  You start with an ample, but limited stash.  You'll quickly find that the game floods you with huge quantities of loot, and before long even just the stuff you really want to keep will start piling up in your stash.  By the time you get to the end of the campaign, you'll be feeling quite a lot of pressure to buy certain stash tabs just for the quality of life.  But let's talk for a second about the campaign.

The campaign is relatively long, in a good way.  Your first time through, it'll probably take 20+ hours of gameplay to complete.  By the time you've done it a few times, you can power through it in a half dozen hours or so, less if you're really hardcore, but you'll always need to do it because  it gives a lot of rewards that your character needs.  Like Diablo 2, the level cap is 100 but as you get into the 90s it becomes a truly insane grind, so most people don't even bother attempting to get to level 100, let alone reach it.  Past a certain point you start losing experience when you die, and at the higher levels you lose so much that even a single death can cost you hours worth of farming to make back the deficit.

All that being said, to go back to the microtransactions, you'll feel pressured to spend $20 or so around the time you're finishing your first campaign.  While I don't like being pressured to spend, especially in such a forceful way, it doesn't feel totally unfair to spend $20 or $30 on a game that you've already spent 20-30 hours playing.  And once you've spent anywhere from $30-$60 on the various stash tabs, you should have more than enough space for just about anything.

Path of Exile isn't an easy game, but if you like ARPGs like Diablo, you should absolutely give it a try.  There's a significant learning hurdle at the start, but once you're over it the game offers nearly endless replayability and a really enjoyable power progression and endgame that will keep you coming back.",diablo fan pretty much entire gaming life one earliest childhood gaming memory saving allowance buy diablo 2 played d2 year preordered collector edition diablo 3 stayed night launch night play since put thousand upon thousand hour playing talking diablo 3 poe review two month ago slump trying find new game catch interest decided finally try poe honestly think might never play diablo 3 poe true spiritual successor diablo 2 diablo 3 went new direction making game casual spectacle focused dropping complex esoteric rpg mechanic liked certainly think mistake diablo 3 poe found perfect medium place diablo 3 smooth satisfying somewhat shallow style diablo 2 clunkier complex deep style poe complex surface standard currency got dozen different type orb used trading crafting variety different way standard class instead poe version class mostly determine start enormous daunting passive tree take time get initial learning hurdle demystify game mechanic rewarded incredibly deep game much fleshed endgame compared diablo 3 nearly infinite build complexity like diablo arpg poe fundamentally classic grindy gameplay loop kill monster acquire gear increase power kill higher level monster get gear increase power level etc etc etc trick game wide variety different build playstyles people keep grinding without feeling bored poe delivers spade class system passive tree ascendancy class unlock via game challenge puzzle level decision make campaign effect character allow insane level complexity without even addressing gear want spellcaster focus almost exclusively melee attack want physical brute focus summoning minion combination imagine made though obviously guarantee good add gearing system skill gem socket link actual gear incredibly deep complex crafting mechanic make truly mind boggling array different character coming diablo 3 usually dozen maybe two dozen good build given season flabbergasted poe easily find hundred difficulty finding decent build picking one amongst many option poe trading system double edged sword one hand really nice able skip rng trade particular item want love able start new alt use currency farmed previous character quickly purchase everything new character need said rarer item almost impossible afford especially start mean build simply expensive play something diablo 3 though play make eventually everything becomes affordable enough poe truly free play let fool pressured paying game mostly sell cosmetic absurdly priced dozen dollar single cosmetic item yikes real kicker sell stash space start ample limited stash quickly find game flood huge quantity loot long even stuff really want keep start piling stash time get end campaign feeling quite lot pressure buy certain stash tab quality life let talk second campaign campaign relatively long good way first time probably take 20 hour gameplay complete time done time power half dozen hour le really hardcore always need give lot reward character need like diablo 2 level cap 100 get 90 becomes truly insane grind people even bother attempting get level 100 let alone reach past certain point start losing experience die higher level lose much even single death cost hour worth farming make back deficit said go back microtransactions feel pressured spend 20 around time finishing first campaign like pressured spend especially forceful way feel totally unfair spend 20 30 game already spent 20 30 hour playing spent anywhere 30 60 various stash tab enough space anything path exile easy game like arpgs like diablo absolutely give try significant learning hurdle start game offer nearly endless replayability really enjoyable power progression endgame keep coming back
892970,Valheim,"Let me say this right off the bat: If you enjoy building/survival games, just buy it. If you have friends who enjoy it, buy the game and purchase a server. Also take a few days off work. You won't regret it. Ok let's talk about it now.

Graphics: Believe me, they are better than you think. They just are. Don't look at screens, don't mind low poly textures, (but enjoy a meager 1gb download for the game), don't worry about anything. The game is GORGEOUS.

Now that we talked about it... Should I tell you about how awesome and immersive the feeling of exploration and adventure is? Like how you look around trying to see in the dark and take out a torch? Or how you see a troll not-so-distant in the fog and freak out?

Or like the game being low fantasy, so requiring good effort and how you start an expedition not knowing what you'll face and where, set up a camp, run from enemies or challenge them, find new loot, mark resources....

Maybe we should talk about the joy of settling down in a village. Building with the just enough amount of realism, working together on tasks, building up resources...

Or we can just talk about cool viking stuff. All the weapons you can forge, enemies you can kill, ships you build and sail with...

Whatever I tell you, it won't do the game justice. Even after its fresh release in EA, Valheim is one of the best games of its type. For me, it's Terraria+UO+7DtD in the best way possible. For you, it may be something else. 

Play it, then let me know what you think in a comment!

Edit: I'm at 120~ hours right now after a week and I've only loved the game more. For anyone commenting/reading comments, here are a few remarks:

Graphics: Yes, the graphics are low poly but it's stylized similar to World of Warcraft. More importantly, unlike WoW, it has really good effects. So if you want to see a detailed face, you aren't getting it. But when you look at nature, the sun rising, how a storm feels, how the light plays out under rain etc. it's incredibly beatiful. I didn't say the graphics were cutting edge, I said it's gorgeous and I stand by it. I'll upload some screenshots after this edit, feel free to check them out. But again - screens don't do it justice because the organic feeling can only be felt when the trees are moving, the waves are rising, the rain pours etc.

Server: As clarified, you do not NEED a server. What I meant was that we took such an instant liking to a game, we wanted to play it under best circumstances. I also need to add that I play with 3 friends and in total we are spread to 3 cities in 2 countries. Plus, dedicated server allows anyone to connect to the game world at any time they want. This is the same with games like Terraria etc. Not a requirement, just a big convenience.
For Terraria I had used gameservers but I couldn't find it there (maybe they added since) so I used gportal, as also promoted by devs.

UO: It does mean Ultima Online. Going out to nature, mining, cutting lumber, coming back to smelt and craft and being sandbox is what makes me think of it. Obviously there are many games like it nowadays but I encountered this stuff first time in UO personally.",let say right bat enjoy building survival game buy friend enjoy buy game purchase server also take day work regret ok let talk graphic believe better think look screen mind low poly texture enjoy meager 1gb download game worry anything game gorgeous talked tell awesome immersive feeling exploration adventure like look around trying see dark take torch see troll distant fog freak like game low fantasy requiring good effort start expedition knowing face set camp run enemy challenge find new loot mark resource maybe talk joy settling village building enough amount realism working together task building resource talk cool viking stuff weapon forge enemy kill ship build sail whatever tell game justice even fresh release ea valheim one best game type terrarium uo 7dtd best way possible may something else play let know think comment edit 120 hour right week loved game anyone commenting reading comment remark graphic yes graphic low poly stylized similar world warcraft importantly unlike wow really good effect want see detailed face getting look nature sun rising storm feel light play rain etc incredibly beatiful say graphic cutting edge said gorgeous stand upload screenshots edit feel free check screen justice organic feeling felt tree moving wave rising rain pours etc server clarified need server meant took instant liking game wanted play best circumstance also need add play 3 friend total spread 3 city 2 country plus dedicated server allows anyone connect game world time want game like terrarium etc requirement big convenience terrarium used gameservers find maybe added since used gportal also promoted devs uo mean ultima online going nature mining cutting lumber coming back smelt craft sandbox make think obviously many game like nowadays encountered stuff first time uo personally

281990,Stellaris,"185+ Hours and 3 full campaigns in and I finally feels like I can review Stellaris objectively.

Stellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from Paradox. So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different; a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.

Campaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar; Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.

Campaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques. 

Campaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched. When one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising, all I needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw AI. Easy peasy! Later when I stumbled across the robot capital world I invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army, killed all the robots, and had  a beautiful Gaia world all to myself. Of course I had no friends, allies, trading partners, or anything else. Sadly, I started getting a little bored so I again jumped to a domination victory.

Currently Stellaris is the tale of three games:

Early game – Brilliantly fun and engaging! Lots of events that change depending on your pre-game choices, lots of 4x fun, and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re-playable.

Mid game – Lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring. Being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone's cup of tea.  

Late game – Some very interesting galaxy wide events/disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest. However, the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit.

Overall I love, LOVE, this game. Does it need more victory conditions? Yes. Does it need more mid game events? Yes. Does it need better tool tips? Yes. Are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever? Yes!

One final thing to keep in mind is that the Clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable AI decisions. And the future Asimov patch will address the mid game issues. Which means that things are going to keep getting better so I highly recommend this game to everyone.

Edited to Add:

Wow! The Clarke patch hit and what a change!

Midway through my fourth campaign and suddenly, after load, the sectors started actually producing, science costs reduced slightly, fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective, federation partners began fighting their own battles (a bit), other empires asked for (and offered) safe passage through their space, diplomatic requests began to pour in, enemy AI combat decisions became much smarter, and all the frontier outposts I had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, bent me over a log, and yelled “squeal like a pig!”

What a massive improvement!

The future Asimov patch is still needed for mid game content, but if you were waiting to buy Stellaris, well wait no more. It is even better now.",185 hour 3 full campaign finally feel like review stellaris objectively stellaris 4x grand strategy game paradox kind expected civilization space kind game like galactic civilization 3 bad thing since love 4x game got something different 4x grand strategy customizable nearly open ended rpg game set apart others 4x field campaign 1 since everything new tried chose thing familiar human warp drive materialist individualist etc found odds influence sector mechanic able build nice little empire several ally federation eventually building real economic military power help federation friend able stop aggressive neighbor throw fallen empire beat back interdimensional invader found wishing victory condition started feeling like getting little stale pumped crap ton colony ship meet domination victory condition owning 40 habitable planet good run campaign 2 within 5 year encountered fallen empire hated beginning instantly declaring war immediately surrender couple year later met another fallen empire hated playing peaceful scientist cat people maybe everyone allergic everyone even regular empire kept insulting threatening declaring war finally curb stomped chunky red paste learn violent abusive loss better influence sector management technique campaign 3 military dictatorship using wormhole generator move difference little experience make never campaign find struggling influence mechanic working oddity sector mechanic become rather easy fallen empire treat child need patience enemy avoided vast fleet economic power unmatched one rival triggered galactic wide robot uprising needed put robot population death outlaw ai easy peasy later stumbled across robot capital world invaded genetically engineered xeno army killed robot beautiful gaia world course friend ally trading partner anything else sadly started getting little bored jumped domination victory currently stellaris tale three game early game brilliantly fun engaging lot event change depending pre game choice lot 4x fun lot role playing make early game really enjoyable playable mid game lot repetitive management required lot new game content occurring warmonger certainly spice part may everyone cup tea late game interesting galaxy wide event disaster occur rise fall neighbor keep interest however lack victory condition make thing drag bit overall love love game need victory condition yes need mid game event yes need better tool tip yes wormhole generator greatest thing ever yes one final thing keep mind clarke patch release fix lot sector issue questionable ai decision future asimov patch address mid game issue mean thing going keep getting better highly recommend game everyone edited add wow clarke patch hit change midway fourth campaign suddenly load sector started actually producing science cost reduced slightly fighter bomber group became wildly effective federation partner began fighting battle bit empire asked offered safe passage space diplomatic request began pour enemy ai combat decision became much smarter frontier outpost hiding sector avoid influence cost grabbed scruff neck bent log yelled squeal like pig massive improvement future asimov patch still needed mid game content waiting buy stellaris well wait even better

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I figure at the 1200hr mark, I feel It's only reasonable to leave my remarks and squawk my experience so far.

As a game, MSFS is a work in progress. It's much, Much better than it was at launch, and with each Sim Update you have a bit of frustration depending if they focus on PC, or on Xbox as for reasons, when they attempt to focus on patches for one, it breaks the other, but coming past SU9, I feel they are continuing to be on the right track and little by little, the game continues to get better and better.

You have read it all before, the Graphics are between good and downright fantastic. This is at the moment, the only game on my system that is the main push for me to build a new PC just to play it. Sim Update Performance improvements have helped quite a bit, but the draw of VR/4K gaming even with a 3090, demands a better CPU and my pretty much ancient X79 based system just isn't enough for this game alone. Even the most recent chip from AMD, the 5800X3D showed that the game Loves CPU Cache, and will use as much as you can get it. Zen 4 is on my radar to be the next big step for getting that bottleneck off the CPU.

Sound is another thing that MSFS does really well at times. Most of the stock planes sound great, and most of the time, a quality 3rd party plane does put some fantastic effort into their audio as well. (PMDG's DC-6 and the Wing42 Boeing 247D are two of my absolute favorites for Radial Relaxation.) When the planes sound good, it really helps nail the experience more than just pretty graphics alone.

VR finally came to the game, and with one of the best implementation using the OpenXR system. Being able to hot swap between 2D and VR on the fly is something many other games should adopt. And if your system is powerful enough for it (Hah, like one truly exist yet with current CPU tech) the game looks amazing maxed out while in VR. The first time I loaded up in the Just Flight Arrow in VR, I could swear I could smell the plane as it was exactly as I would be in a real one many times before. There is still plenty of work to be done for VR. The VR Controls continue to need work and adjustment as well as 3rd party support, but when they can finally get to the point that you can just click, rotate, pull, etc all the cockpit buttons, dials, and levers in VR, it will be an absolutely amazing experience. For now, it is still extremely good, and will continue to get better as technology and the systems improve.

Flight Model is something that some people may love, some may hate, some may like for some plane and not others, some may say X-Plane/P3D/etc does better. For a Sim and a Game, MSFS has nailed a pretty solid representation of how it feels to fly most planes. They are continuing to improve it immensely with added physics and aerodynamic model improvements and again, the game continues to grow and improve over time where the physics will inevitably follow. On the smaller planes, things are quite close to real life comparing to my real world experience, larger birds seem to be pretty close as well depending on the ones you are flying and how much you trust the Weather systems effects on the plane as well. Is it Perfect, no, but I do feel that over time it can be made as simple, or as true to life as one may want and has the CPU performance to emulate down the road.

Weather is another thing that while its had it's fair share of bugs and goofy issues, when it does work correct, it really does add to the immersion factor of the game and gives you the true sense of flying in something other than a clear calm blue sky. Hopefully it can be expanded to truly emulate hurricanes and other more extreme weather, but for now, being able to fly a little Cessna into a Hurricane during the season is kind of fun for something you would never want to do in the real world.

Gameplay is something that at the present system, is possibly lacking to those that are either a little unfamiliar with Flight Sims of this type, but also a lack of implementation ingame that at least for the time being, is being somewhat provided by third party services to add a form of ""Campaign"" or ""Career"" mode. My personal favorite is Flight Sim Economy (FSEconomy), and The Skypark from Orbx. The Skypark gives you some fun and adventurous routes to fly in all sorts of interesting parts of the world, and has a extremely slick app and interface design that works really well. FSE is a much more dated interface and system, but has a lot more depth for things like the world economy, the ability to own and rent/lease planes, maintain and service them, and even run your own FBO network. It too will take you to many different parts of the world but you do have to make your own goals for what you want in the long run, like any open world career sim would. It would be nice if MSFS eventually adds its own sort of Career/Campaign mode that interacts directly and deeply within its own systems, and eventually I believe it will happen, but for now, outside of the lack of marketing/exposure for many of these alternate 3rd party solutions, the ones that are out there do scratch the itch pretty well at least for now.

The Download System many have complained about, and it sounds like Steam actually dodged the bullet compared to the Windows Store version that has even harder times getting patches to apply on Sim Update day sometimes, but I personally, spread between multiple completely separate PC's in my house, have had no issues whatsoever downloading/reinstalling the game or updating when patches are released. Good internet is a must but you will never max out your bandwidth as even with Gigabit, the game does seem to top out at around 200-300Mbit and then since it does handle one file at a time, is at the limit of downloading that file, extracting and processing it, and going onto the next which is a very slow and linear process, and being the game is near 200G at this point, does take time no matter how fast your PC/Internet/etc is. When it all works though, it does eventually finish and works fine at least for me. One big thing that I think even a few Xbox users are missing is when you do download an update or even after first install, you do have to go to the Package Manager under your profile tab, and ""Select All"" and download all those updates as well, especially after every patch, to update all the other packages not part of the main core game. If you don't do that, you will be missing a lot of content and fixes that could cause the game to crash if it's not updated after a Sim Update. The whole separate system like this is very silly I completely agree, but once you grasp it, it works, just very clunky and slowly, but it does, work...

Controller support for the game is very good, one thing I do hope to return in due time would be Force Feedback support as when you have that working, flying a plane really does feel real as you feel the resistance of the air against the control surfaces. And the game supports many of the current, past, and probably future sticks, yokes, gamepads, etc and has customization options galore. One of my favorite devices to use however for quick flights without having to swap in/out the whole Joystick/Throttle/Peddle setup, is using the Steam Controller. The Gyro on the Steam Controller works fantastic as a virtual yoke and allows for near pinpoint precision control over everything except the Yaw access. The triggers though that control yaw, do have finer control than say the same triggers on an Xbox One controller so even that is an improvement over just a conventional gamepad. This does give me great excitement for playing MSFS on the Steam Deck as you will pretty much have the sim, in a portable system combined with a Steam Controller. Fantastic and I cannot wait for mine for quick couch FSE hops.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.

Lost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.

Reminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.

The story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.

The story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.

You do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.

The progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.

As you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).

Gold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!

Bots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.

If you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.

This game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.

""Lost Ark respect your time."": So we were told, turns out it doesn't.

""Lost Ark is alt friendly."": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There's so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.

Lost Ark doesn't respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.",going write review hope new player get basic understanding gon na get time writing stopped playing game almost 2 week ago today logged take snapshot character screen like souvenir uninstalled going thumb someone spent 2 000 hour game yeah going kind person lost ark game give lot thing going particularly enjoy give honest opinion much enjoyed lost ark 2k hour played say maybe 20 fun 80 waste time game want waste time get good part reminder writing new player existing player gon na read comment disable comment criticize within reason keep mind experience launch experience someone new today going stark contrast story average mmorpg shtick likely going stop paying attention poor english localization half hour game start mashing g key thus meme might seen already going press g next 12 hour fast get sidetracked else looking 15 hour g spamming story compelling get occasional cool cutscenes pretty much tell everything need know sent way tedious story question go x speak npc spend 1 minute go speak npc go back x speak npc rinse repeat ad nauseam 12 15 hour hit tier 1 gear point start shifting gon na daily routine rest lost ark career progression t1 mid t3 going brutal dead zone dead zone bot wherever going content barely player help literally going phase going spend roughly next 100 hour realistically going closer 200 hour get decent spot t3 decent spot always moving target game get new content playerbase keep moving forward tedious going get come merciful touch playerbase dev feeling feeling time settle daily routine gon na realize much rng involved various aspect game much purely waste time way going enjoy imagine important item locked behind collectible low chance drop three time every week might get first try might end getting 20th week thing ask anyone moake hell group friend get item drop others still left behind 3 month still killing bos gold going valuable currency one farm going trash value bot oh schoolgirl skin see people walking around get cash shop 40 spend 45 000 gold purchase auction house making 3 000k gold week well tough luck save 15 week hope inflation caused disgusting amount bot going make price rocket 60k time get 45k oh even save gold actually need hone weapon armor purchase mat buy dungeon raid chest etc etc guess luck bot rampant 4 month ago thought bot worse point looking price rmt oh boy wrong rmt price currently half price thought worse point 4 month ago mean current game term botting rmt twice worse time thought worse inflation time high still manage push barrier somehow manage get character high enough end game raid content congrats also tough luck one gon na take raid game huge time sink willing spend time fail raid fail fail learn likeliness 7 people either happy teach fail low going spending quite sometime party finder go nowhere game fun back launched huge group actual people running beside world breath fresh air fun everyone learning everyone talking current new player experience dead zone wish upon anyone end game brutal reach content difficulty mostly due going get filtered everything huge waste time aimed squeezing play hour player lost ark respect time told turn lost ark alt friendly game foundation built upon multiple character statement far truth much thing make game alt friendly dev outright refuse one biggest offender material shard character bound alt friendly game shard would never bound neither guardian destruction leapstones would bound lost ark respect time possibly one worse case botting ever seen online game

892970,Valheim,"Valheim is currently extremely popular for a reason. While I don't think it's perfect, it does a lot of things right that other survival games don't. It's surprisingly well thought-through with many elaborate systems in place which make a lot of sense in the context of a survival setting. Valheim is a single or online multiplayer co-op survival game that combines elements from Minecraft, Rust, souls like games and even Elder Scrolls and adds a lot on top of it, to round out everything into one game which makes it feel ‘whole’ and well designed. It constantly makes you think about how you want to approach each of the game’s aspects, whether it’s building, combat or exploration.

Your main progression goal is to defeat the game's 'forsaken' bosses which in turn not only give you new items to progress with but also grant you their power. These powers come in form of an unlimited use, but long cooldown AOE-Buffs. Unlike many other survival games, you're not only progressing through your equipment, but also directly with your character, as almost all in-game actions correspond to a skill that you can level up by simply doing it a lot. You need to be careful though, as deaths become increasingly punishing, because they will set you back a percentage of your skill progression (and drop all your items in the place you died in). This skill system feels really good in my opinion, because it offers room for everyone, ranging from generalist to specialist and anything in between. You might want to be the sword and shield wielding, heavy armor type of player, or you might want to be the sneaky backstabber or even the swift archer. All of these playstyles work, but neither of them will be ideal for all the situations the game will throw you into. Whichever you choose, so far I've never felt like I had chosen the 'wrong' way to play, where progression seems completely impossible without putting more time into leveling up some other skill. Furthermore you’re never required to reach a certain skill level to do a specific thing, you’re only ever getting better at doing it by leveling up your skills.

The base or home building game is another aspect of the game that I think the game does really well. While the game offers you the ability to build strictly grid based, you can build nearly anything however you like, should the grid as well as the half size options not fit your needs. The game also actively rewards you for a lot of the furniture and decorations you can build by increasing the 'comfort'-level of your housing. Basically higher comfort will give you a longer lasting buff when you rest inside. As you gather more materials you will unlock more crafting recipes, which will make sure you're never overwhelmed with too many options all at once. When building a house, you'll find that you'll have to keep a lot of things in mind. First of all structural integrity is not a given, hover over your building pieces with your building hammer to see how stable your structure is. If it goes too far into the red it will break unless you build additional pillars or walls for support. Other stuff to worry about include the rain putting out your fires and the smoke of fires hurting you if you let it build up in your home, so plan your house to keep stuff like this in mind as you learn more. If you're the type who would rather shape your surroundings to your likings instead of adjusting your buildings according to them the game also offers terra-forming options for that, so digging a moat or raising your foundation high above everything else is an option!

Exploration in the game feels great. There are a lot of biomes to see and the landscapes are beautiful. There is never a shortage of new things to see, although some biomes are by design harder to survive in than others, so don't wander into new territory carelessly. The game will usually intuitively let you know where you should look for progress next, either through item naming (For instance if you get a swamp key, that means you can go look for a swamp) or through the tutorial bird, who always shows up when you discover something new that isn't self explanatory. Be aware though that building a base in a more dangerous area than the starting one will definitely require you to defend it against foes, either through fighting or through clever base design.

Lastly, the combat in this game. It's mostly inspired by souls like games, with stamina, blocking and dodging all playing an important part. What I like here is that this plays very well together with the skill system in the game, as you will find that certain types of enemies take increased damage from certain types of damage (i.e. blunt weapons, slashing weapons, piercing weapons). So leveling up your sword and spear skill could potentially help you in some areas, while leveling up only one will result in the maximum damage from that type of weapon. Some enemies will be easier to block, while for others you'll want to dodge their attacks (and some are just better dealt with at range). Generally I'd say the combat in the game is fun, although sometimes it gets frustrating to run out of stamina frequently.

Generally the game felt the best to me, when I saw how well the different aspects of the game work together. Crafting, building, gathering, fighting, exploring, looting- They all go hand in hand with each other. For instance when you're crafting your armor, you'll find that you can upgrade it with additional material, but it also requires a higher level workbench, which you'll get if you built your home with one or more of the workbench improvements near the workbench. You want to gather a lot of wood or stone? You might want to make a cart to drag it behind you and carry a lot more, but first you'll probably also want to have a path so that the cart doesn’t get stuck on every rock or bush. There's a river in the way? Build a bridge! But make sure it's stable enough and while you're at it, maybe give it a roof as well, so it's safe from the rain. Later you might want to come back and build a better bridge from stone and make a paved road for what might now be an important travel route for you. And transporting stuff will always stay relevant, even if you get better methods of transportation a little into the game, so planning for some means of moving stuff around will definitely pay off.

Here's a couple things I didn't like about the game: Firstly the stamina system generally works really well, and the higher you level your skills, the less stamina your actions will drain. However there are a ton of ways the game can make you regain stamina more slowly though debuffs like 'cold' at night or 'wet' during the rain and sometimes it feels slow and frustrating to have very limited actions available, simply because of circumstances that you could technically work around, but more often than not simply end up having to accept. Also in multiplayer, when you'll want to equip like 4-6 people with the latest and upgraded equipment it can take a long time to acquire enough materials, especially if you're just playing casually or if you don't plan properly. Personally I've run into some bugs that ended up costing me a fair amount of progress, however from what I can tell that bug has been fixed since. You should still expect to run into bugs every now and then and the game server can be laggy sometimes. Some enemies are also hard to deal with without proper precautions and knowledge, which I personally think is okay, but I know it will cause frustration to some.

If you like survival games in general and have a couple friends to play with, definitely give Valheim a try. If you liked Rust, but disliked how easily you can lose all your progress to PVP, Valheim got you covered. If you feel like a mix between Minecraft and Elder Scrolls could be fun, that's also a strong indication you'll probably like the game. At about 20 bucks, I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price.

1063730,New World,"I haven't reached level 60 yet (I'm close, at 54), but I'm already feeling a bit burned out thanks to a myriad of weird design choices on AGS' part. For starters, there's no ingame restriction so that a faction can't control 90% of the land, thus disabling 90% of the endgame content (faction warfare). 

On the server I'm playing right now, my own faction owns all but two cities, and this is mostly due to a big clan from another game just showing up in numbers and creating like 8 clans that just steamroll everything. End result? You can't play in a war if you aren't from one of their companies, you can't really do large scale PvP because almost no one from other factions bothers to go outside with PvP on, and you can't even play the PvE invasions, because the ruling clan will abuse the kick mechanic to select 50 players instead of the 10 they should be selecting.

Even if we don't consider these issues, there's a lot of other stuff going on that is slowly eroding my patience. Imagine you go into a dungeon with your friends, fight all the way to the end, then one of your party dies when the final boss is at 5% HP. Guess what you have to do if you want everyone to be able to complete their dungeon quest/get loot? Yeah, you need to force a wipe because the game won't let that other player get their stuff or complete their missions. Who thought that was a good idea?
Or imagine you put your stuff up for sale on a town that has lower taxes, then while you are visiting another area which has extreme taxes, that item sells. Guess what? You'll get charged the extreme taxes, even if the item was actually sold on the lower taxes area. Why? Ask AGS, because it makes zero sense to me.

I'll keep going for a while because the game has a lot of potential, but so far, it feels like it squanders more and more with every passing week.",reached level 60 yet close 54 already feeling bit burned thanks myriad weird design choice ag part starter ingame restriction faction control 90 land thus disabling 90 endgame content faction warfare server playing right faction owns two city mostly due big clan another game showing number creating like 8 clan steamroll everything end result play war one company really large scale pvp almost one faction bother go outside pvp even play pve invasion ruling clan abuse kick mechanic select 50 player instead 10 selecting even consider issue lot stuff going slowly eroding patience imagine go dungeon friend fight way end one party dy final bos 5 hp guess want everyone able complete dungeon quest get loot yeah need force wipe game let player get stuff complete mission thought good idea imagine put stuff sale town lower tax visiting another area extreme tax item sell guess get charged extreme tax even item actually sold lower tax area ask ag make zero sense keep going game lot potential far feel like squanders every passing week
899770,Last Epoch,"So, approaching this as a POE player. There's a lot to like, for one, crafting. In the eternal words of Todd Howard, it just works. It's RNG, yes, but it's RNG in a way that flavors the player. Instead of getting something incredible or something useless, you get something good, or something great. They're adding onto this too, with legendary items becoming a take on the unique system that really shows that the devs are listening, and giving players ways to use build enabling items. 

The combat is weighty, with lots of follow-through and some degree of intentional clunk. This is not path of exile with tailwind and reduced action speed, and it definitely takes some getting used to. But, its fun, and fast. Build variety is immense. The game may not have the enormous skill trees of POE but by focusing on not being a one button game, it enables a lot of variety, and the crafting system means if you want to try something, you can easily make the gear to enable it. Plus, respeccing a character is very easy, meaning changing builds is a cakewalk. 

Endgame wise, it is lacking. The developers are continuely putting effort into this, adding new dungeons and the like, opting for a different system than just reskinned rifts or maps from POE, but with a monolith of fate system that serves that goal as well, albeit one that is outdated at this point, although the devs have spoken on their intentions to update that somewhere down the line. 

The devs get criticism for being slow, especially with regards to multiplayer, which has been coming soon for over a year now, but they're taking their time to get it right. They're open and transparent about it, and if multiplayer is make or break for you, when it comes out, it will be in a working fun state. 

All in all, right now this is a fun replayable game with a lot of variety, and most importantly, good bones that has potential to be the next genre defining arpg.

I really like this game, I have been gaming 42 years since I was 8, and am a DevOps Engineer so you know I like tidy processes, I really like what you have here for an early access game. UX/UE is pleasing refinement of the bar I am sure will come, other than that I have a stable 3 district sharing resources setup, about to grind out metal. But I just wanted to give you guys some love from the game so far.

I read the gripes, whatever... they are the type that whine about the 3rd pixel in the title of the loading screen is offset incorrectly when you are at max 50k resolution, 

Thank you for offering the early access of the game, I have a few friends playing and even the girlfriend. (She loves this shit) It's a Good wholesome game with the foulest of jokes about wet beavers. I appreciate your art and decent fun I look forward to seeing how this all plays out.

It's a souls-like and the market is literally flooded with games of this genre..

But this one is different, Lies of P is one of the games that truly deserves to be called a souls-like!
Not only does it nail the combat mechanics (!), but also the world building and everything around it.

It's a complete package and in 2023 something like this has become disappointingly scarce.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"Dominions 6 is pretty much one big improvement on Dominions 5. If you liked 5, you,ll like this. Don't let the sprites fool you, if you are a wargaming fan who enjoys a lot of depth, get this game. Even if it's just for singleplayer. I didn't touch multiplayer in Dominions 5 at all and I still got over a thousand hours' worth of content.

Also word of warning for newcomers: This game has a very steep learning curve. You WILL mess up. You WILL be subject to many forms of RNG, some good and some bad. Read EVERYTHING or else you,ll end up with items-usually items YOU forge- going rogue, cannibal giants eating your capital, sinking your own provinces into the sea, or attracting god-devouring horrors beyond comprehension.

On the other hand, the new nations-like Andramania's dog-headed badasses, the cavemen of Pyrene and Muspelheim's sooty, VERY hot giants- are very fun, as are the touch-ups and reworks of several other nations who really needed it. 

So call me biased, but I like this game. Get it. Go crazy. Try all sorts of weird nonesense. Nuke yourself out of morbid curiosity like I did.

1063730,New World,"New World is a game with infinite potential, but is handled by lazy and incompetent management. Mired by issues since it's launch, it was never able to recover. For reasons beyond all understanding, Amazon thought it wise to push out numerous ""bugfix"" patches without ever creating a Public Test server. Sure, they eventually did make one, but it was far too late.

PvP was destroyed by bugs and exploits, and thanks to the mass-exodus of frustrated PvPers, the warring faction game design fell apart completely. Numerous servers are now completely owned by a single faction without any hope of upheaval. People in the other factions face exorbitant taxes, price markups and fast-travel costs, and cannot join the dominating factions. This causes even more to leave.

The crafters had their crafting gear completely removed from the game with the hope of re-adding it in future, for no real reason. Crafters log in naked and are pitifully compensated for their loss. The watermarking/prestige endgame system also nukes crafters from orbit, where crafting endgame gear scales it down to their level. Which means crafters that spend more time crafting and less time doing the pitiful PvE endgame content will find their goods diminish heavily in value. Crafters begin their own mass-exodus from the game.

All the while, numerous currency duplication glitches plague the game. And thanks to the lack of a Test Server, one of the fixes for a money duping glitch RESULTED in another, separate duping glitch. At this point, the economy was completely obliterated. Most of the still-dedicated players were now sitting atop hoards of gold numbering in the millions, if not billions. Anything they wanted, they could buy. Prices of regular items skyrocketed thanks to the devalued currency. Newer players that didn't have the ability to abuse these glitches now cannot use the auction house thanks to the price of everything being way too high, thanks to the infinite quantities of cash flowing in the server. This causes even more players to leave; and heavily discourages any more from joining.

Servers are now at critically low levels, and the in-game systems work against it yet again. With less people playing, taxes aren't being paid. This causes towns to decline, crafting stations to lose their levels, and suddenly nobody can craft anything. Everything is stuck at level one, and it takes time and resources to level them back up -- not just cash. This causes those dying servers to lose even more, putting them in a death-spiral they can't recover from. At the time of writing, the most populated servers in the entire game, in all regions, hardly go over half of their total capacity anymore. And many, *many* more do not even come close to half capacity.

An awful, mismanaged mess.",new world game infinite potential handled lazy incompetent management mired issue since launch never able recover reason beyond understanding amazon thought wise push numerous bugfix patch without ever creating public test server sure eventually make one far late pvp destroyed bug exploit thanks mass exodus frustrated pvpers warring faction game design fell apart completely numerous server completely owned single faction without hope upheaval people faction face exorbitant tax price markup fast travel cost join dominating faction cause even leave crafter crafting gear completely removed game hope adding future real reason crafter log naked pitifully compensated loss watermarking prestige endgame system also nuke crafter orbit crafting endgame gear scale level mean crafter spend time crafting le time pitiful pve endgame content find good diminish heavily value crafter begin mass exodus game numerous currency duplication glitch plague game thanks lack test server one fix money duping glitch resulted another separate duping glitch point economy completely obliterated still dedicated player sitting atop hoard gold numbering million billion anything wanted could buy price regular item skyrocketed thanks devalued currency newer player ability abuse glitch use auction house thanks price everything way high thanks infinite quantity cash flowing server cause even player leave heavily discourages joining server critically low level game system work yet le people playing tax paid cause town decline crafting station lose level suddenly nobody craft anything everything stuck level one take time resource level back cash cause dying server lose even putting death spiral recover time writing populated server entire game region hardly go half total capacity anymore many many even come close half capacity awful mismanaged mess

281990,Stellaris,"This is the story of the United Nations of Earth Star Empire and how they conquered the galaxy.

My empire begun life in a small section of the galaxy named Sol.
After a few years of scanning the stars and exploring neighbouring systems I meet a new friendly race. We trade minerals and energy credits and all is well.
Shortly after, a fallen empire emerges and demands that we both stop expanding our territories.
We form a pact against this new menace, however, even with our combined strength, their power is still 100x that of ours, a lesson we painfully learned when the fallen empire declared war on us and decimated our systems.
This pattern goes on for several decades, every few years, declaring war on us, and slapping us around to make sure we knew our place.

All the while, a new power, comprised of some very ugly looking aliens, is emerging on the far side of the galaxy, gaining systems, planets, and resources, and is not close enough to the Fallen Empire to be deemed a threat, which will be their undoing.

Several decades go by, new races pop up and greet, or insult, us. We trade, we form pacts, we break pacts, until.... the emerging power on the far side of the galaxy is now getting close to the Fallen Empire, this causes border friction and they begin trading insults, until eventually, war breaks out between them. They trade blows off and on for several decades.
This gives me and my friend time to colonise some planets and gain some power.

Eventually the ugly aliens crush the Fallen Empire down to just two planets, at which point their war ends.
This is where it gets interesting, for whatever reason, the Fallen Empire contats me and tells me that I'm ugly and one of the great accidents of the universe, again, he was probably still bitter about the border friction. I've deicded I've had enough, and I send my fleet into his space.
I destroy what's left of his infrastructure and land a dozen armies on his planet to capture it. I win the war and effectively wipe him off the map, although, their territory was immediately taken by the ugly aliens, who now control 1/3 of the galaxy.

Getting worried, I decide to keep away from them and build up my own forces, expanding away from them for a few decades.
During this time, they are getting closer to my border, and they decide to intergrate my neighbour into their empire, my neighbour, is no more. I am alone.

No sooner than I realise this do I get a transmission, a race not too far away from me, let's call them the Very Ugly Aliens. They contact me and accuse me of being the ugly one, despite them having more than 1 nose and sounding like a warthog.
They don't like me getting close to their borders either. Every few years they randomly throw insults at me, reminding me that my race is doomed, how ugly I am, or that I should never have existed. They aren't a threat though, as their fleet power is inferior to mine, so I let him get on with it.

For decades I research the best in weapons and shields technology that I can, slowly building up my forces. I have a sizable fleet when suddenly, a vast amount of large objects enter the outer rim of the galaxy. It takes a few weeks for reports to start coming in, and it appears, it's an invasion force, some to purge all life from the galaxy. They enter the space of the Very Ugly Aliens and begin their purge, being the nice neighbour that I am, I decide to help out, and my fleet gets crushed in the process.

The invasion force make the mistake of scattering their fleet across several empires, this makes each force easier to deal with, and, as a galaxy, we manage to fend them off. The United Nations of Earth get the final blow, and we save the galaxy. Although this victory impresses the galaxy and carries some weight with them, it doesn't stop them insinuating that Humans wear clothes to hide their ugly bodies. The usual trade of insults continue.

Two new planets emerge from the very ugly aliens and immediately ask for my protection, which I gave. I now have two small allies.

Several years go by with little activity, other than me building my huge fleet. Since my fleet is getting so large, I'm running out of power, so I decide to build a Dyson Sphere around a star, this takes decades, but gives me enough power to run any sized fleet I want. I also decide to build the largest sensor array ever seen, which gives me complete coverage of the entire galaxy, I know where every fleet is at every time.

At this point, the original ugly aliens now control 50% of the galaxy space, they are getting too big, and must be stopped. They used to be my friends, but have now started trading insults with me due to border friction, and have closed their borders. We declare each other as rivals.

Ugly two-nosed warthog aliens are still throwing insults at me, and I decide it's time to shut them up, I declare war, although, I made the mistake of not checking who they were allied with, it was ugly alien 1 who own 50% of the galaxy, and I onwn about 20%. Their fleet power is overwhelming compared to mine, I don't stand a chance.

Using my new sensor array, I could track their fleets anywhere they went. A direction confrontation would be fatal to me, so I fall back on good tactics. I play the cat and mouse game. Hitting their space ports, destroying their mining stations, then moving onto the next sector. They decide, instead of chasing me, to bomb Earth back to the stone age. They take control of Earth and Alpha Centuri and move on. As they move off, I swoop back in and regain control of them. I hit their landing parties and small fleets while their larger fleets are attacking other targets.
I bomb several of his planets and land my armies on there. I now controll several of his planets, and my fleets hide in wait.

He comes back to try and regain control of his planet again. By this point, his fleets are scattered between attacking my sectors, and reclaiming his own. My fleet jumps back into his sector and picks off his smaller fleet, then jumps back out.
During this time, all my shipyards and churning out destroyers which immediately come to join my travelling fleet, which just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
After several years of hit and run attacks, his fleets and dwindling, and I receive a transmission....
""Come now Human, let us end this war before it gets out of control"" Hmmm, nope, I don't think so, he didnt even offer a consession, screen off.
I continue my assault for a few more years, he keeps begging for mercy and offering me planets in the hope I'll stop, but I refuse. Eventually he surrenders and gives me several planets that I originally wanted.

His fleet is now mostly destroy, warthog aliens are mostly destroyed, and I have taken control of at least 10% of their territory.

They have no way to come back from this, and no one else is strong enough to take on my empire. it is only a matter of time before the whole galaxy is mine...",story united nation earth star empire conquered galaxy empire begun life small section galaxy named sol year scanning star exploring neighbouring system meet new friendly race trade mineral energy credit well shortly fallen empire emerges demand stop expanding territory form pact new menace however even combined strength power still 100x lesson painfully learned fallen empire declared war u decimated system pattern go several decade every year declaring war u slapping u around make sure knew place new power comprised ugly looking alien emerging far side galaxy gaining system planet resource close enough fallen empire deemed threat undoing several decade go new race pop greet insult u trade form pact break pact emerging power far side galaxy getting close fallen empire cause border friction begin trading insult eventually war break trade blow several decade give friend time colonise planet gain power eventually ugly alien crush fallen empire two planet point war end get interesting whatever reason fallen empire contats tell ugly one great accident universe probably still bitter border friction deicded enough send fleet space destroy left infrastructure land dozen army planet capture win war effectively wipe map although territory immediately taken ugly alien control 1 3 galaxy getting worried decide keep away build force expanding away decade time getting closer border decide intergrate neighbour empire neighbour alone sooner realise get transmission race far away let call ugly alien contact accuse ugly one despite 1 nose sounding like warthog like getting close border either every year randomly throw insult reminding race doomed ugly never existed threat though fleet power inferior mine let get decade research best weapon shield technology slowly building force sizable fleet suddenly vast amount large object enter outer rim galaxy take week report start coming appears invasion force purge life galaxy enter space ugly alien begin purge nice neighbour decide help fleet get crushed process invasion force make mistake scattering fleet across several empire make force easier deal galaxy manage fend united nation earth get final blow save galaxy although victory impress galaxy carry weight stop insinuating human wear clothes hide ugly body usual trade insult continue two new planet emerge ugly alien immediately ask protection gave two small ally several year go little activity building huge fleet since fleet getting large running power decide build dyson sphere around star take decade give enough power run sized fleet want also decide build largest sensor array ever seen give complete coverage entire galaxy know every fleet every time point original ugly alien control 50 galaxy space getting big must stopped used friend started trading insult due border friction closed border declare rival ugly two nosed warthog alien still throwing insult decide time shut declare war although made mistake checking allied ugly alien 1 50 galaxy onwn 20 fleet power overwhelming compared mine stand chance using new sensor array could track fleet anywhere went direction confrontation would fatal fall back good tactic play cat mouse game hitting space port destroying mining station moving onto next sector decide instead chasing bomb earth back stone age take control earth alpha centuri move move swoop back regain control hit landing party small fleet larger fleet attacking target bomb several planet land army controll several planet fleet hide wait come back try regain control planet point fleet scattered attacking sector reclaiming fleet jump back sector pick smaller fleet jump back time shipyard churning destroyer immediately come join travelling fleet keep getting bigger bigger several year hit run attack fleet dwindling receive transmission come human let u end war get control hmmm nope think didnt even offer consession screen continue assault year keep begging mercy offering planet hope stop refuse eventually surrender give several planet originally wanted fleet mostly destroy warthog alien mostly destroyed taken control least 10 territory way come back one else strong enough take empire matter time whole galaxy mine

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Had enough.

Darktide is 2 months old as of this review. It has not received the significant updates it deserves, the fixes it desperately needs or any of the attention that a live service demands.

Since the beta versions of this game, the community has screamed out about one particular enemy being almost unplayable. It glitches, it's almost impossible to dodge, or avoid. Fatshark's answer to this issue and problem was to MAKE a modifier that INCREASES the amounts those enemies spawn. 
Then they left that as the ONLY modifier for the past 5 weeks now. Done. Sick of it.

They had someone come in over Christmas to switch the real money cash shop over to the next rotation, but not maps, not map modifiers, no fixes, no updates. NOTHING.

This is where this game has come to a negative score for me, I have defended it, stood by it, shouted about how much great potential it has.. only to week after week be not only disappointed and let down by the devs, or left frustrated and mad. Anger isn't enough either, it's just utterly piss poor. 

Fatshark are the WORST developer company I have had the misfortune of being a fan of, I enjoy most of the core gameplay from their games, but almost nothing else. The way they implement the features to a game, is not just backwards, but it is almost always a complete headache, illogical mess that only further disrespects the player. 

Darktide is a huge factor to that right now, we were promised new maps and modifiers in December, we only got more dogs and a almost mirror reflection of a previous map (Typical Fatshark style here, claiming reverse maps as NEW maps).
We were supposed to have a crafting system by the end of December, we don't, even at the end of January.
As I write this, a statement was released about making another statement at the end of the week. They said that last week aswell, and as of no surprise, we have no updates or fixes on the day we were told, hey we would have updates and fixes.

Darktide has so many faults it's hard to list them all, but some serious ones that can deter any sustainable replay value are :

No options to choose your desired map (You must play what is on the board // Hardly rotates)
No options to choose modifier (stuck with the weekly, which has been up for weeks now)
No full crafting system (You can not forge a weapon, you must buy RNG)
Full RNG loot system  (It is complete cancer)
No reward system (Playing a map and completing it does NOT reward loot)
No end game features (Such as Fortunes of War or Chaos Wastes//Weaves)
No complimentary features (Such as collectables or secrets)
Insane loading times on high end computers
Terrible optimization on high end computers

Matchmaking is GOD AWFUL - THE VERY WORST
Matchmaking into empty lobbies
Bots that are not of equal level or ability
Bots that are not interactable or helpful (They can not carry books and sometimes leave you to die)
Bots that purposely destroy exploding barrels or trigger Demonhosts

Maps look amazing, the first couple of times, maybe even up to the 100 hour mark. Then the maps just bleed into each other, hardly much separation in biomes or atmosphere.
This is again another major sour point for a Fatshark game, the game has released with such a small selection of maps again, instead of a good decent 20 maps, we get like 10, but can only ever play maybe 3 at a time. Sometimes this means for HOURS, as Heresy and Damnation level maps only rotate hourly or more.

Most of the in game cosmetics you can earn are pretty lack luster, leaving only the premium real money cosmetics looking any good, and they still have a lot of clipping issues and skin contact issues. 

The mourning star, the ship, the hub we are all apart of, again, extremely lack luster. Feels empty and it's not as helpful as it could be. 
The Psykhanium for best example, only allows single player interactions. Does not properly show the buff or blessings triggering. 
I can't sit there with team auras, or team blessings to balance out our team or engage with the enemy in combat, it's a glorified solo training dummy.

Vermintide 1/2 to Darktide - The road that was paved but is missing all the essential bricks to glory.

As much as I really want to love this game, despite so many glaring issues I have with it, I am not going to praise this company anymore, or give them any more lime light. 

They deserve EVERY negative review this game gets slammed with, and truthfully and honestly, it has been such a DISGUSTING release, that STEAM should be stepping in here and offering full refunds to all players reguardless of hours played. 
We should not have to wait around for 6 months for them to finish concentrating all the efforts into finishing a console release, just to pillage those poor people of money aswell. 

This company needs to be seriously pulled into line, either via the players with these reviews. Steam oversight, or lawsuits. Yes lawsuits. What features were outlined as part of the full release of the game ARE NOT IN THE GAME 2 MONTHS AFTER RELEASE. 

This is a early access product that Fatshark is using to milk money out of you, to punch out console releases and scam money out of more people. They will leave this game unfinished and in a terrible state for the first year minimum, as they did with Vermintide 2. This is why they do not deserve your money, they do not deserve their asking price either.

If you do wish to buy this game, PLEASE wait until it is a minimum of 60% off. 
This is the first game in a very long time that I bought at full price at first release, and it has been a very regrettable experience.

This review comes from someone who invested 2000 hours into Vermintide 2 and only truly wishes this game to eventually become fantastic. Right now, where it is, it is not, and won't be for a long time.

I have been pretty polite in this review, because as I state right there ^ I still WANT this game to be good, I don't want to slam it into the ground and bury it. However, it absolutely requires this harsh criticism to better its future.

Sad to leave this negative review, but after not having any desire to play for 2 weeks due to so many issues, and today where we have been told there is another delay to just informing of us of what is going on. I can't help but be left so dissatisfied in this company.",enough darktide 2 month old review received significant update deserves fix desperately need attention live service demand since beta version game community screamed one particular enemy almost unplayable glitch almost impossible dodge avoid fatshark answer issue problem make modifier increase amount enemy spawn left modifier past 5 week done sick someone come christmas switch real money cash shop next rotation map map modifier fix update nothing game come negative score defended stood shouted much great potential week week disappointed let devs left frustrated mad anger enough either utterly piss poor fatshark worst developer company misfortune fan enjoy core gameplay game almost nothing else way implement feature game backwards almost always complete headache illogical mess disrespect player darktide huge factor right promised new map modifier december got dog almost mirror reflection previous map typical fatshark style claiming reverse map new map supposed crafting system end december even end january write statement released making another statement end week said last week aswell surprise update fix day told hey would update fix darktide many fault hard list serious one deter sustainable replay value option choose desired map must play board hardly rotates option choose modifier stuck weekly week full crafting system forge weapon must buy rng full rng loot system complete cancer reward system playing map completing reward loot end game feature fortune war chaos waste weave complimentary feature collectable secret insane loading time high end computer terrible optimization high end computer matchmaking god awful worst matchmaking empty lobby bot equal level ability bot interactable helpful carry book sometimes leave die bot purposely destroy exploding barrel trigger demonhosts map look amazing first couple time maybe even 100 hour mark map bleed hardly much separation biome atmosphere another major sour point fatshark game game released small selection map instead good decent 20 map get like 10 ever play maybe 3 time sometimes mean hour heresy damnation level map rotate hourly game cosmetic earn pretty lack luster leaving premium real money cosmetic looking good still lot clipping issue skin contact issue mourning star ship hub apart extremely lack luster feel empty helpful could psykhanium best example allows single player interaction properly show buff blessing triggering sit team aura team blessing balance team engage enemy combat glorified solo training dummy vermintide 1 2 darktide road paved missing essential brick glory much really want love game despite many glaring issue going praise company anymore give lime light deserve every negative review game get slammed truthfully honestly disgusting release steam stepping offering full refund player reguardless hour played wait around 6 month finish concentrating effort finishing console release pillage poor people money aswell company need seriously pulled line either via player review steam oversight lawsuit yes lawsuit feature outlined part full release game game 2 month release early access product fatshark using milk money punch console release scam money people leave game unfinished terrible state first year minimum vermintide 2 deserve money deserve asking price either wish buy game please wait minimum 60 first game long time bought full price first release regrettable experience review come someone invested 2000 hour vermintide 2 truly wish game eventually become fantastic right long time pretty polite review state right still want game good want slam ground bury however absolutely requires harsh criticism better future sad leave negative review desire play 2 week due many issue today told another delay informing u going help left dissatisfied company

>so basically a single month has passed after my operation barborossa level civil war and I was plunged into another war, my initial treasury of 2000 (43 a month) ducats pre war was reduced to -400 ducats (-5.1 a month); couldnt get worse right?

>as I mustered the last of my levies to take out the rebels in the nepalese mountains (thank god my 5000+ perstige ruler lived for so long that I was able to upgrade my military tech and barracks) i recieved a pop up that made me almost hit my head on the wall. an outbreak of the beubonic plaige happened in my capital as I was gaining the upper hand in my second war of independence
> my culture was hindustani, and in the hindustani culture in this game, you're not able to grant titltes (give away providence lands) to your sons and daughters, the culture ditcates that you must share your land with your brothers and sisters no matter what (unless you try and murder them)
>because of this, god tier papa with the 5000+ presitge and 37 intelligence died and had nearly 9 kids that had to each inherit one of my titles, which resulted in the heir (my next character) getting the capital when papa died. the capital was the hotspot of the buboinic plague so literally every single one of my sons/daughters/brothers/sisters fking died either on the battlefield or due to the bubonic plague outbreak in my capital (my only county of residence). 
>after a year, all my children and siblings died except for one soul surviving heir (my grandson) who got the beubonic plague but recovered after finding myself a physician and plunging my tresury deeper into the hole at -1000. but sure fking enough, he died about a few minutes after I recieved the notification that the beubonic outbreak has ceased to exist in my empire.

i had no more heirs so what does that mean?

Summary:
all memes aside, this game is something else. this is easily one of the best modern paradox games that they've produced. apart from all other paradox games, there is no late game superority where you're so strong that nothing can defeat you or destroy you. the game does not get easier just because you are the world super power regarding tech advantages/prestige/treasury ect, you simply have much more microing to do to ensure your longevity and your spot on the top. in this game, ironically, the bigger and stronger you become, the more vunerable you become. 
 
also theres boobies in this game

270880,American Truck Simulator,"It's 2am in San Diego, Ca. You just picked up a double of gravel, and it's your job to get it to Carson City, NV. in one piece, or two pieces, whatever. It's your first double, and you just bought a longer truck, so you're on edge as you snake your way through the narrow corridors of the miniture representation of Southern California, praying that you took that turn wide enough to avoid that stop light. You finally make it to the highway on-ramp. Traffic is pretty heavy for this early in the morning. Luckily, a tour bus stops in the middle of the highway and lets you merge. Weird, but appreciated none the less.

The next hour or so of your life is filled with constant taps on your A and D keys, as you snake your way through California. You put on some music to fill your ears with something else besides the low rumble of your Pete. Suddenly, traffic in front of you comes to a halt. Thankfully for you and your fellow commuters, you kept enough space between you and them, and quickly pressing on the brakes brings you to a rather abrupt stop. You see flashing lights ahead of you, and...is that a plane? After waiting for a few minutes for your brothers of the road to figure out how to zipper into the left lane, you pass what is indeed a small plane on the highway, surrounded by cones and a cop car. 

Confused and introspective, you cruise into Carson City. This is it, the moment you've been waiting for. You roll up to the little booth at the entrance to the company yard and press Enter. Two options flash before you. Isn't there usually three? Anyway, ""Auto Complete"" or ""Where do you want it?"". Your mouse hovers over the auto-complete. I'm basically done, it's just a few XP right? No. Earn those points. Carry that weight. You defiantely click on the harder option. You slam it (click it) into gear and hammer down. You get about five feet down the dirt path then...THUNK. Your truck stops on a dime. You slowly swivel your head to your left mirror, and horror grips your heart. Your last wheel is stuck on a pole!

Let's be honest, you're not that great at backing up a single trailer, let alone two! You ponder what to do, before deciding to just go for it. You gingerly put the truck into reverse, slowly backing up into traffic, trailers going north AND south. Back in drive, you ease forward. Your last tire clears the pipe by a hair. You breathe a sigh of relief as you cruise past the gate guard, who seems too awestruck at your driving prowess to react or move or breathe. Rounding the corner, you see the little outline on the ground. Cut it wide right then back left, ease her up until that little prompt flashes, and you're done. 

One double lighter, and $15,000 heavier, you pull into the gas station. After filling up your truck, you check the job screen. After that ordeal, you look for the smallest trailer possible, but what's this? An oversize load. Can my truck pull that? Probably not, but it'll be downhill all the way...

Also, paying for early access means that problems can happen and you are helping the development team perfecting the game. You don't like the scenario of early access, don't pay for it.

Being enjoying the game. Slow paced and have to balance workers, resources and think ahead for the harsh winters.
I never mind to wait for progress in city building games and this game, playing on normal speed takes time to achieve goals. But I rather enjoy the ride than to finish it in one day.

I hope the development team keeps providing updates, content and upgrading the game.

1190000,Car Mechanic Simulator 2021,"I enjoy the mechanics of the gameplay loop, but the mechanics of the cars is disappointingly inaccurate, as someone who has worked on cars for many years. Some things that should be intuitive have extra unnecessary steps, and many procedures are fundamentally wrong.

Some examples:
In order to pull engine heads, you must remove the camshafts (and every cap and bolt that entails). That's silly and isn't something any mechanic would do unless they were changing the camshafts.

All of the fluids besides oil are missing every other step of the process for each fluid. Brake fluid is syringed from the reservoir, but you don't drain or bleed the brakes at the wheels. Coolant is syringed from the reservoir, if there is one, otherwise it is syringed from the radiator fill cap. There is no bleeding step. Further, if there is no reservoir and you refill coolant at the radiator, you only need to fill it to roughly 3/4 full, or you can top it off as much as you like, and you are penalized for spilling fluids if you fill it until it overflows. Power steering fluid is also drained at the reservoir, but not the rack.

Occasionally there are cars that have serpentine belts and pulleys that get removed out of order. For example, the idlers before the belt, or idlers before the tensioner. There's some layouts where the alternator would be the tensioner, but you don't need to do anything at all to remove the belt.

Some cars have ignition wires, some just have coil packs and no wires, and of course there are no connections going between major components, so, no wiring harness, grounding wires, battery cables, brake lines, coolant hoses, throttle cables, fuel lines, etc...

Oil filters can typically only be removed with the car fully raised on the lift, even if the filter is obviously accessible from the hood.

The wheel bearing is removed before the hub, on all four corners. Typically you install these in the knuckle before the hub, or they're part of the hub assembly. Also, CV axles can be removed without disassembling any links at the knuckle, which is a dream fantasy lol. Typically you have to loosen the tie rod end, or a shock assembly, or an entire arm.

I've played like six hours but I'm sure to continue finding inaccuracies like these. It's a bit immersion breaking, and for some things inconvenient too. I would go on but I want to return to playing now, and that's why it's recommended.

edit:
Some things i would love to see in the future:

○ valvetrain components: valves, valve springs, porting, cylinder boring. Procedures like head decking and port polishing.
○ gaskets, and maybe even bolts in your inventory that must be restocked from a vendor. special large OEM bolts.
○ service manuals for cars instead of the guided linear path.
○ brake lines, coolant hoses, cables and wiring harnesses. Simple but realistic procedures for fluids and disconnect/reconnect.
○ special hand tools for parts that have multiple methods for disassembly. for example, ball joint pullers, pickle forks, BFH, your mom's purse.
○ make the minigames more engaging--the game for fluids should be avoiding spills, like those early web Flash games. Pulling an engine could include balancing it on the hoist.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"So, been playing more after 'release' and I can't say that I can change my opinion. It's an ok game but there's still so much lacking before it can be called a full release that I can't recommend it to anyone in this state.

A lot, if not all, of my former points are still a problem. Still need to micromanage everything every season to have an optimal production, still a lot of math and notes about what I need on a spreadsheet on my 2nd screen, still no way to decorate properly, still a lackluster village you build with no need for interactions with your villagers at all, still weird progressions in the different talent trees, etc.

I plan on continuing my playthrough till I at least reach a bit beyond the point I was before i had to start over due to the 'full release', probably till i can get iron unlocked if I'm not bored by it by then, but i don't see it suddenly getting better. Maybe I'll come back to it once everything they still promise is added (see roadmap once they post the new one) but I doubt it.

Too bad, this game had great potential but imho ultimately failed to deliver...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLD REVIEW:

Fun game, but I feel like they're taking it out of EA to early. Imho there are still quite a lot of balancing issues or missing features before it can be named a good game.

For example, my hunters produce a lot of meat but my villagers are too stupid to roast it themselves so I have to do it for them. Then I finally unlock a tavern but somehow that can't seem to produce enough meals (simple ones, just some meat and carrots) for everyone either so I had to build a 2nd one that just roasts meat so my village has something to eat.

I would love to see a ""Needed a day"" feature. Recently got me my first chicken coop, bought me a rooster and 2 hens for it but I have no idea how many animal feed a day I need for them.

Would also love a 'workload' bar or something. Started a small farm but I have no idea how many fields I can make, or how big I can make them. Can my 1 farmer finish everything I told them to do or should I assign a second one? No idea... Also on that, a seasonal planting assignment would be nice as well. Some crops only grow in certain seasons (love that idea) but micromanaging every season gets tedious as well.

Some 'tech' trees feel wrong as well. For example, I've been hunting since I first started the game, put the first few points into getting more xp for it, but still it's leveling up very slow. And since you don't really need to hunt anymore after a certain point it just feels tedious to level it at all. 

Assigning stuff to make at workstation is weird as well. You have to assign a percentage to the items you want to make and that sets how many will be made a day. For example, 10% to a Wooden Hammer would make you 1,2 a day. But there is no way to see how many of an item you need a day unless you do the math yourself. And since the number of items you need a day depends on the workload you assign to something (for example, you hunters need knifes to produce meat, but if you set it at like 20% workload they need less knives than at 60%) it's again a lot of math to do. Again, tedious... And then you go up in tech you can use (start out with stone knives, can suddenly make copper ones) it's math again since the system is about durability and copper knives have more, so last longer.

Also there are some immersion issues:
- The houses that you can build lack in furniture. There are 3 different houses you can build. Haven't unlocked the 3rd one yet but the 2nd house has 4 beds, a crate and a cooking pot with no options to build them other furniture. Yes, you can unlock stuff like tables and chairs to build but there's no place for them inside the house. Also, it's very dark inside, even with the cooking fire on.
- You can get random quests from people that give you some gold or some food and some reputation. Your villagers can give you them as well but it's weird that your villager that has access to a fully stocked pantry still tells you that her family is starving and she needs more food. On that note, would be nice that the quest would tell you what item is needed before you have to decline or accept. I had a hunter ask for a bow and only after I accepted it showed me that he wanted a bow I can't even make yet because it's locked behind the tech tree.
- The village you can build, and the items you can unlock, kinda seem lackluster. Can't really decorate your place and it just feels empty. Since there's so few furniture for you to place down there's also no need to unlock items. Some just cost way too much to unlock, certainly at the start, and there's no use for them after. Why would I unlock a wooden spoon to make if I can't place it on a table somewhere or that I have to make a hundred of and sell them to make the unlocking cost back, when other items make you more money for less resources? On top of that you can just skip some tech. I could almost skip copper (have 2 items unlocked) and go straight into bronze without any issue.

1063730,New World,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
I have 280+ hours in this game as of writing. I started day 2 or 3, basically as soon as launch day queues settled. I play on Utensia, a good middle-pop server (~1,000 players peak, no queues) with all factions viable. I level capped, have a high gear score watermark, am officer of a PvP company that holds territory, and run all end-game content (war, invasions, raids, pvp arena.) I am at the end of the rainbow. There is no pot of gold. It's just a buggy mess, unfulfilled promises, and devs too busy working to implement server transfers to actually fix the game.

Several features are broken. Several systems are broken. Servers are dying.

Bottom line: the game isn't finished and you're already late to the party. Save your money.

[h1]Why have you played so much if it's bad?[/h1]
I got in early, so I'm on the bleeding edge of the power curve on the server. I got to be a part of all the server firsts (buying territory, early wars, first invasion, outpost rush, etc).

Unfortunately, [b]you will never have this experience[/b] because these experiences are dead. There are no new servers and existing ones never reset. War outcomes never change (see more on that below.) The economic snowball rolls downhill. Until the level or Gear Score cap rise, new players simply cannot catch server leaders. Amazon hasn't announced when an expansion will come, but I highly doubt many players will be around to see it. If you start now, you can still grab the fruit, but other players have wrung out all the juice.

[h1]The Exploits[/h1]
A month in, there have been game-breaking exploits that:
- Made players invulnerable in PvP
- Duped hundreds of thousands of gold upon server transfer
- Power-leveled players because of stupidly high respawn rates in one area
- Force victory in an event (war or invasion) by glitching out adding/removing players from the event
- Caused the premier end-game PvP mode, Outpost Rush, to be enabled for less than 4 hours since launch.
- Prevented players from clearing Tier 5 corruption, then over-rewarded players for doing so
- Cause opponents to lag out in Wars by using AoE spells

To fix these, Amazon has (in order) issued a patch within a couple days, stopped server transfers, cut respawn rate, done nothing but hope it doesn't go viral, disabled the mode, disabled the rewards, and done nothing.

Focus on that last one: Ice Gauntlet and Life Staff are key PvP War weapons because they provide AoE DOT/crowd control and AoE HOT. PvP War is fought over control points, meaning up to 100 players can surround and fight for a single point. Stacking these spells [b]always[/b] results in players on the point lagging out, unable to move or attack. Every war devolves into throwing AoE (and lagouts) back and forth between the two sides until one of them dies while lagged. This takes forever to resolve and are thus wars are basically impossible for attackers to win.

Make no mistake: [b]the PvP war experience sucks[/b]. If you're melee, you literally aren't playing half the time. Amazon has done [b]nothing[/b] to address this.

This game isn't even close to finished.

[h1]The Bugs[/h1]
There are hundreds of niggling bugs floating around this game. Some of them are dumb and bad. Some of them should never have cleared playtesting. None of them should still exist. Som examples:
The animation for the 250 Strength perk means you need to stay at 249. The Fire Staff's Pillar of Flame randomly casts centered on you, rather than your aimer. The healing interface on Life Staff is a mess. These affect the core loop of the game: combat.

Attempting to interact with an object that's being interacted with by another player (like closing a corruption portal) glitches out your auto-run. Players found a way to restore it; THEY HAD TO BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SO G*D D*MN ALWAYS.

Settlements don't correctly report the levels of their crafting/refining stations on the Map.

Many in-game tooltips are just factually incorrect (light armor!)

The most annoying bug of all, however, is resource tracking. In lieu of minimap, there's a compass HUD that indicates the presence of resources nearby. As you level gathering skills, nearby resources are automatically tracked on your HUD. Except when they aren't. Sometimes, tracking just glitches and stops working at random. Oops! The kicker is, this feature is garbage. You don't need it. Resource spawn locations aren't randomized. They could've avoided this bug by removing the feature they failed to implement.

Many of these existed in beta; why aren't they fixed by Patch #3?

[h1]Design Issues[/h1]
There are several break points in even the Main Quest. There are three required 5-man raids but no LFG system beyond a chat channel. Inexplicably two main quest bosses are difficult/impossible to solo, but also exist behind doors that [b]require a player to have the quest to enter[/b]. As players finish, they can no longer help players behind them. The final boss needs at least 5 players to kill reliably under 10 minutes, even at level 60. Naturally, there's an exploit that makes it possible for ranged characters to solo it. Betting that will get patched before Wars get fixed.

Combat feels promising, but the interaction between animation canceling, action buffering, and server responsiveness just feels bad. Take Fire Staff: if you cast and hold LMB (heavy attack) before the animation finishes, you will do nothing after. If you cast and hold RMB to block, you will block immediately after. Factor in potions, weapon swaps, enemy abilities, lag, etc, and it all produces a very cludgy system that rewards micro mechanics more than macro mechanics like ability choices, combos, dodging, and aim. Of course, even if you sort this out, sometimes you'll cast a spell on your own head. Get wrecked, PvP mages.

Kotaku is writing articles about in-game deflation. The economy sucks.

[h1]Factions[/h1]
This was the killer feature: actual, meaningful, inter-faction conflict. A company (guild) controls a territory for as long as it can, then another company comes along to knock them off their perch and take their lands. Every few weeks, the map changes with the ebbs and flows of PvP warfare and political maneuvering. Right? Right? Wrong.

This started on Day 1. On most servers, the faction that controls Everfall controls the whole server because it's a central starting zone for crafting/refining. Everfall generates the most taxes and funds the most upgrades, cementing its status as the hub of the world. With those taxes, the controller buys additional territories and snowballs the map. OK, that's fine. That's what war is for.

But war is bugged. As stated above, attackers have little chance of winning. As time passes, territories upgrade their defenses, making it even harder. There are [b]zero[/b] meaningful catch-up mechanics to encourage turnover. As controlling companies fill, new players can't even participate.

There are real benefits to being the majority faction: cheaper fast travel, trading/crafting discounts, more XP and rep. New players can see the map is purple, join purple, and level easier/faster. Existing players cannot switch to the winning faction. This further snowballs and cements status quo unless companies deliberately engineer other outcomes. Cool feature.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
It's an MMO. There are 4 kinds of quests. There are a couple dozen types of enemies and move sets, most of them barely even reskinned from the same ones you've seen a dozen times. The raid bosses are interesting, but most enemies you'll see a thousand times throughout questing. The crafting system is expansive, but the economy is borked. Storage is scarce. You can decorate your house. 

After ~300 hours, I'm pot committed on the idea this game might get fixed. If you're reading this, you can do something else with your time. You probably should.

There are no mounts, but there is a lot of walking. At least there's auto-run... assuming it hasn't glitched out.",h1 summary h1 280 hour game writing started day 2 3 basically soon launch day queue settled play utensia good middle pop server 1 000

So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

Overall, the gameplay is incredibly addicting and the community is amazing as well.

238960,Path of Exile,"At the time of writing this review I have 2498 hours put into this game. 

You should consider playing Path of Exile if: 
1. You liked Diablo 2, but find Diablo 3 underwhelming and the end game too boring and simple. 
2. You like ARPGs
3. You like games in which there are several tasks at any time you can spend your time on (crafting, farming, trading, theorycrafting, etc.) 
4. You seek a balanced game where there are numerous viable builds and only your creativity with the houndreds and houndreds of items and skill gems limits you. 
5. You want to play a game that is constantly updated and balanced with large content additions all the time, including a major expansion every year. 
6. You're looking for a game that is truly free to play. All purchasable stuff is cosmetic, with the exception of some quality-of-life upgrades, which are not necessary in order to enjoy and play the game. 

Path of Exile has a lot more ""depth"" to it than other ARPGs on the market. The skill system, where you can mix-and-match between skill gems; the unique items with special and sometimes build-enabling stats, and the end game map system all contribute to a game that takes something simple and turns it very interesting. 

Personally, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have played WoW, Diablo, LoL, CS, HS, HotS, SC, and many other games for countless hours, but no game has ever kept me interested for the amount of time that Path of Exile has - it just keeps getting better, and the developers communicate a lot with the community in order to continue to improve the game.

105600,Terraria,"Terraria's latest major update, [strike]Journey's End (1.4)[/strike] Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).


[b]Intro:[/b]
If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.


[b]Building:[/b]
When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.


[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Overall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.


[b]Music:[/b]
Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.


[b]Multiplayer:[/b]
Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.

Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.

Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.


[b]Performance:[/b]
Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.

There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.


[b]Price:[/b]
Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.


[b]Struggles:[/b]
Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.

To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.

My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).


[b]Tips:[/b]
* Organize and name chests ASAP
* Place rope down a Hellevator
* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators
* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control
* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time
* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot
* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients
* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms
* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)


[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.",terrarium latest major update strike journey end 1 4 strike labor love 1 4 4 great

[/b] EDIT: The real fun for me was actually sometimes ending up looking back hearing a ""Watch out"" over the headphones. You may have an awesome sound system (I dont) but still, the experience changes a lot over headphones.

[b] FYI - There is a lot of walking and finding symbols, easy puzzle solving with an easy to master combat. If that isnt your type of game,you probably wont like this. If you seek Environment, Immersion, Good story - Welcome home my friend. You & me both found what we were looking for. [/b]

First thing first, running solid 60fps at 1920x1080p res on a Ryzen 1600 & RX-580. No stutter, no lag. Very high preset. Two bugs encountered in entire game.

The graphics were bleak. Very bleak. The first 15minutes sets up the tone of the game. The much talked about binaural voices and the initial psychosis plays out right in front of you. And the voices get creepy over time. EDIT: Really really creepy as the game progresses.

The concept of Rot is also nice. Cool exposition on Norse mythology along the way.

Combat isnt too tough to master. (Just would have preferred a different button to Parry / Block attack tbh, changed it anyways)

Also, Melina Juergen's performance as Senua. TOP NOTCH. The motion capture shines in later stages as you can actually feel the angst of Senua.

Oh and there is a cool photo mode in the game.

Story : This is a clear and simple Love story between Senua & [spoiler]Dillion[/spoiler]. The way the story is presented through flashbacks and voice overs, gives it that much a tragic touch. The [b]demons[/b] Senua fights, both in the [b] World & in her Head [/b] is what makes this conflict that much interesting. Sometimes it blurs the line (e.g in one instance [spoiler]Senua refers a monster to her father).[/spoiler] And that ending [spoiler] is something I am not going to spoil here, because it was confusing in a lot of ways. Too CONFUSING!! You fell for it, didnt ya? XD [/spoiler]

The Mental Disorder part has been presented in a way that it literally made my jaws drop. [b]Flashing colors , Blackness, Hallucinations, Voices [/b] actually ends up being disorienting in game.

230410,Warframe,"[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]
Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.

[h1] Grinding [/h1]
I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"So I've played SWTOR on and off since it's release. I pre-ordered it and have my black-yellow crystal on all my characters, and have well over 1k hours total played before it migrated over to Steam as an additional download option. I've played WoW and FF14, but I could not get into Final Fantasy. During Warlords of Draenor for WoW, I came back to this game, took a break, and after Legion I started playing this game more often. 

I'll start off with a pros/cons list as a simple outline and I will elaborate a little more on them as they are listed.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
Class Story: I adore the class stories in this game. From being a Sith rising through the ranks, a Spec Force trooper taking out enemies of the Republic, or a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy by taking bounties, the stories are really enjoyable and I find myself making new character almost all the time. Yea, there are some real stinkers in my opinion, I don't like Consular all that much, and Trooper is halfway decent, but the Empire is where it's at. Imperial Agent has the best story hands down.

Gameplay: It's a pretty standard MMO, WASD movement, keybinds, auto attacks, building/spending. To people migrating from a game like WoW, I'd say they'll be pretty comfortable. Some moves feel weighty and flashy and are fun to pull off. Nothing too complex, I'd say.

Expansions: Aside from maybe the Rise of the Hutt Cartel and maaaaybe Shadow of Revan, I'd say storywise these expansions are great additions and are a must to do at least once. If story isn't your thing, well, that's cool too.

Community: If you find yourself a nice, social guild to start, you'll have a good time. There are some really nice people I've met on here.

Transmog: I cannot understate how much I love the transmog this game has. Being able to mix and match armor pieces and then being able to unify the color of the chest piece is such a super handy tool to have that I wish most other games would try to emulate.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

Community: Yea, I know, twice. While there are some nice people, there are some really nasty folk, but that's kind of what you expect sometimes. Mostly just chat trolls, or PvP tryhards, even guilds full of people who are just, well, not friendly at all. If you're running a flashpoint, which is this games form of dungeon, chances are if you aren't in a group with your friends, the people will plan on trying to speedrun it and expect you to keep up and skip cutscenes.

Content Droughts: There are just large bits of no content from the developers. They're good folk, don't get me wrong, but having to wait months on end for a couple missions for story or even just something new to do is very boring and leads to burnout.

Leveling: This one is kind of subjective and I like the leveling but I know it's kind of a big thing for some people; the leveling goes by pretty quick. You get XP boosts from class quests and if you're doing side quests on the first couple planets, you'll likely reach a level cap if you're unsubbed before you finish your class quests. I'd wager to say you'd also finish even as a sub. Granted, planets do scale you to a planetary cap, but that really takes away a sense of progression to some.

Inflation: Galactic Trade Network prices for some Cartel Market items is through the roof. A crate that gives you random Cartel Market items is, if I recall correctly, somewhere in the high millions, which to some is chump change. But then you have an item that sells 30 of those for upwards of billions of credits and cannot even be listed on the GTN, which is absurd.

[h1] Bonus [/h1]
Consider this extra section a ""I couldn't decide where to put this, and some of these may or may not affect you in some way or another.

Cash Shop: While there is a cash shop, it is mostly for cosmetic purposes or boosts. There is no ""buy endgame gear"" from their store, which is good for some. The game is F2P, and there are ways to earn the premium currency (Cartel Coins) from playing. You could argue that selling the items you get onto the Auction House/Galactic Trade Network is some form of P2W, but I don't think it's a very good way of doing things.

Customer Support: Maybe back in the day when there was a highly active team working on this, this probably wouldn't even be mentioned. I have had so much trouble with customer support as of late despite being very concise with my information for certain issues, and nothing has been fixed. If they ask you to send screenshots through your email, I doubt they will ever see them. Also, do not get subs from the Steam store, there are a ton of issues with it that still haven't been worked out.

[h1] In Closing [/h1]
As I said at the start, I love SWTOR. But the game has its issues, some in control and others out of. I'm no designer, and I have no tried and true method of fixing the issues. If you're migrating over from another MMO, or would really like to get some great Star Wars story and fulfill some fantasies you've had about being a member of the Republic or Empire in an era before the OT, then I implore you to give this game a try. Even if you don't like playing with other people, there is still single player content for you to keep you busy, and if you enjoy interacting with others, there is plenty to do.

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"Edit 12/2 - It's been a while since I first wrote this, so adding an update section at the bottom.

--Original Review--
Sea of Thieves is the distilled essence of adventure. You start the game up, grab some supplies with your friends, load up your ship, and set sail to see what fate awaits you.

I offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions. The first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure, and the second is that you don't mind when it all goes pear shaped.

Sea of Thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players, sailing from island to island, fighting skeletons, ghost ships, digging up treasure, solving riddles, delivering cargo, and fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know what's going to happen next on your adventure. There's plenty of things to chase, and you'll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.

One important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start. You spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies, there's no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlock, more on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummer, it's actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game you're given a new ship, new supplies, and an ocean full of treasure to explore. Truly, you have nothing to lose. Until you find treasure, that is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail, solo or with friends. And it's shockingly easy to play solo if you desire, the smallest ship, the Sloop, is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.

The only progression in this game is cosmetics. Anything else you get exists solely to get you, you guessed it, more cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But hey, the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword, ship, or guns.

The game recently started a battle pass system with season one. The pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming. I'm willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without, but you're not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.

--Update--
Since it's been a fair while and four full seasons since I first wrote this review, I felt it was time for an update. Overall, I still stand by the original review, with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship, you have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles, then you'll be just as scuttled as your ships.

Season Five just launched, and after a middling Season 2, Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. There's a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasons, which is a reasonably high bar; 5 story missions in season 3, and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)

The biggest quality of life change in S5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface. This along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game, but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeed, you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Then, you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take this, and if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?

It's even better than that though. You can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board (this amount is pretty reasonable I feel, the days go quickly in the sea of thieves), and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may vary, as it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage big, fruitful treasure maps. Really, it's a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.

The best part of the whole treasure map system though? They're saved on your quests table as an item called a Map Bundle. What's that mean? It means if you sink, you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their maps, I guess, if you're a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate, it's lovely design because it means they're transferable, you could gift the map bundle, or simply leave it at an outpost when you're done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over, and it means that should things go bad for all involves, the treasue may be lost to all.

The game has been at it's best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose (even though the sting of loss can be quite painful, it's something we must learn to accept). Remember, the whole ocean is open to you, so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens, happens.",edit 12 2 since first wrote adding update section bottom original review sea thief distilled essence adventure start game grab supply friend load ship set sail see fate awaits offer game easy recommend couple condition first like chaos unknown adventure second mind go pear shaped sea thief pirate ocean player sailing island island fighting skeleton ghost ship digging treasure solving riddle delivering cargo fighting sea monster never quite know going happen next adventure plenty thing chase never without task long care pick one one vendor one important design choice aware jumping game every session fresh start spawn ship bare bone supply progression session aside cosmetic unlock also thing unlock bit bummer actually quite freeing every time launch game given new ship new supply ocean full treasure explore truly nothing lose find treasure something lose game simply fantastic giving unique adventure every time sail solo friend shockingly easy play solo desire smallest ship sloop solo player friendly wish asocial pirate progression game cosmetic anything else get exists solely get guessed cosmetic make cash shop little weird hey upside nobody going beat better sword ship gun game recently started battle pas system season one pas season one frankly little underwhelming willing give pas since game quite enjoyable without missing anything exciting getting pas update since fair four full season since first wrote review felt time update overall still stand original review disclaimer able accept win loss game certainly frustrating time much like ship let roll like water let bad moment cling like barnacle scuttled ship season five launched middling season 2 content packed season 3 4 season 5 could called quality life season decent chunk new content though nothing like previous season reasonably high bar 5 story mission season 3 roughly 8 new explorable lootable area season 4 biggest quality life change s5 able quickly easily transfer resource barrel storage crate without open interface along probably would given another 100 hour game also decided add buried treasure system indeed bury treasure create treasure map put map quest board outpost pirate take successfully sell treasue boom get rewarded fantastic even better though take five treasure pers per game day board amount pretty reasonable feel day go quickly sea thief player map contain buried treasure course quality treasure may vary could anything though commendation encourage big fruitful treasure map really box chocolate never know gon na get best part whole treasure map system though saved quest table item called map bundle mean mean sink lose map need recover bundle people could steal map could steal map guess jerk idea lose treasure map may feel bit unfortunate lovely design mean transferable could gift map bundle simply leave outpost done someone else find add excitement treasure buried could yoinked boarder carried away could recover stolen bundle regain rightful treasure add another layer thing pirate bicker barter mean thing go bad involves treasue may lost game best balance thrill gain risk lose even though sting loss quite painful something must learn accept remember whole ocean open long go attitude happens happens
703080,Planet Zoo,"Welp after a few hundred hours its time for me to finally give this game a review.
Im gonna preface this that this game is one of my favorite games and my favorite creative game for multiple reasons.
Ofcourse i like animals, i am a zoo nerd, BUT i want to talk about none of that.

This game is imo arguably the best building game on the market, if you like animals or not and just the amount of freedom and pieces you get in the game is astonishing, completly breaking any caps making your creativity your limit.
Im somewhat competent of a builder by now aswell, but if you want to see how much you can push the limits of the game, go to the frontier forums and search for ""Sallands Adventure Zoo"" from the youtuber PS Vision Gaming. The zoo part in the name is imaginary, instead of building a zoo this guy built a whole modern town set in the neatherlands so if the fact that its a zoo game kept you from buying it (eventhough lets be honest if that was the case why would you even read this) this game still is a fantastic choice to just build whatever your heart desires.

But talking about honestly, this games main point of critic ive seen is the large amount of dlc, which is a fair critice to make, but none of them really sat right with me. Most people say its bad because content is locked behind them, which is simply not true. No major content in itself is locked behind a dlc and the main game is completly sufficent in giving you a great experience, but where the dlc really come in is to spice up the game and expand where the base game is lacking.
For my own quick suggestions, do not get any dlc at the start, unless you allready know enough about the game that you know you will enjoy it. When you play the game, learn the ropes which can allready take a litte as the building has quite the steep learning curve as anything about aesthetic has and for that time the base game and its 75 species and 6 distinct building themes are more then enough. 
Once you got a bit more into it and enjoy the game, thats when i would buy dlcs one at the time regarding whatever your preferences are. Wanna built an australian area? Cool get the australia pack. South America? South America Pack! And so on and so for. There are 3 packs id recommend outside of this pattern, those being the europe, the wetlands and the grasslands pack.
The grass- and wetlands pack offer a good array of only(!) animals, each giving 7 normal animals and 1 terarrium animal for the wetlands and 5 different butterflys for the grassland pack. These packs combine fill the base games most lacking areas, increasing the amount of of south american habitat animals from 2 to 6, the australian from 1 to 4 with arguably the 2 most important ones in the emu and wallaby, add 2 more birds to go from 3 to 5 and filling out the list of asian animals which mostly are very big in the base game with some smaller creatures, including a cute otter! With these 2 packs you not only increase the amount of animals from 75 to 95, the most possible with any combination of 2 packs, it also expands most lacking areas to a degree that they become passable, even without their specific dlc.
The europe pack is here for another reason, as its by far the most important pack for building none zoo things, as it features 250+ new pieces, the most out of any dlc, focused on different european architecture, giving a great boon to building beautiful european styled buildings and while this pack is not neccessary for that it does expand the options by quite alot and makes it much easier.

Besides the dlcs, the game also has offerd a free update that came with each of them, featuring many new mechanics and just new things, sometimes larger and smaller, making sure to give everybody something whenever a new dlc rolls around if they buy it or not. Each update has a few new free plants, bug fixes and many other new things with the last update for example featuring 12 new plants, 4 new music tracks, an ingame video editor to make tours of your zoos, a camera mode, the ability to customise staff members uniform, adding a new behaviour to one base game and 2 dlc animals to make them more unique and overhauling a base game animals looks by adding multiple new colormorphs and mutations for it.
And this was arguably one of the lighter updates, as the 2 anniversary updates for example both have added a new animal to the game for free (the black and white ruffed lemure and the red deer).

So all in all if you like building games, animals or zoos this is the game for you. The animals are beautiful, the building fantastic and the options allmost limitless, only being limited by your creativity. Dont be scared of the dlcs, you wont need them and can buy them, if at all, over time when you need them and still have a more then enjoyable experiance that regulary gets updated with a few new toys.

Ich spiele schon seit längerer Zeit dieses Spiel und kann nun eine bessere Review schreiben, als zuvor.

Ich würde dieses Spiel jedem weiter empfehlen der auf Team Ego Shooter steht , da es in diesem Spiel sehr das Teamplay gefragt ist...

Die Runden dauern nicht als zu lange und wenn man keine Lust auf Ranked hat kann man gechillt Casual spielen.

Ubisoft versucht wirklich das Spiel am Leben zu halten und setzen dies auch gut in die Tat um

Das Spiel reizt einfach es gibt immer neue Spieler man möchte jede Season beweißen was man drauf hat 

von mir ein dickes + für Rainbow Six Siege



and btw : THE FUTRE belong to R6S !

So gut wie keine Cheater im vergleich zu den unten genannten Spielen

eine Empfehlung Wert!


This Game got a great Future ahead! 

And if you think there are many cheaters.. check out PuBg,Fortnite,Call of Duty,Cs Go 

Rainbow Six Siege / Ubisoft is the best Game and you can't change the Facts.

+ realistic, and slow (as I have long wished in a swat/rainbow six successor)
+ complex maps that are always being expanded and new ones are added.
+ very intelligent AI even if it has times aimbot.
(hides in closets, fake surrender, throws away gun takes it again when not paying attention or pulls knife)
+ always feedback from the devs current work on the game (as I know it in no other game like)
+ sound backdrop 
+ very nice atmosphere
+ friendly community

= game is from price performance really good, 
so don't be fooled by the supporter edition it is only there to support the developers.

- the footsteps sounds you can partly not distinguish whether they are under you or above you.
- in current status still too few weapons
- singleplayer is no fun because the ally ai is too strong and everything aimbottet away

From me the game is absolutely recommended, especially with friends it is fun. My best shooter of this year.

739630,Phasmophobia,"Dev, please hire a team. This game is not allowed to perish under the physical limitations of a single human trying to work on it. Brilliant but needs aggressive expansion before it disappears from people's radars.

PS: The review is positive, I love it. Kinda seen everything in it but, I enjoy it. Multiplayer games tend to have a short life span (Particularly Indie ones), directly related to the player base. If this goes one month without *Content* updates (which is very very very likely to happen) players will drop it, uninstall, and find a better MP game to stay on. It's a huge task to keep a MP game alive, but one can only hope.

And for anyone in the comments, this might not be the best place to express concerns. There is a discord https://discord.gg/QxvWuqX which is very active. Also, I understand that they update the game for bugs and fixes on a daily basis, but I am referring to content because that is what keeps players engaged.

Also, here is the Trello, for anyone who is interested in what is to come for this game.

892970,Valheim,"Valheim provides an excellent creative outlet. You get to explore, craft, build, and play 'your' way in a visually pleasing environment. In addition, it is an excellent platform for playing with a group of friends. I can't think of any other game that accomplishes all of these things so harmoniously. It does this while occupying less than 2 gigs of storage space on your computer.

I will add that the pace of development has been dreadfully slow. A little slow compared to the typical development speed of similar games, and catastrophically slow compared to the developers' original ambitions.

All told, I have to recommend this game, given all of the entertainment it provided me. There are a couple caveats to my recommendation. The first is that you should wait to play it. The development is slow, and I think most people will be done playing the game before they ever see meaningful new content. The second is that you should definitely play with a group of friends. It is a big, lonely world if you are the only Viking on the map. Thank you to whoever reads my review, and happy gaming!

Edit: 

I'd like to conclude that I no longer think you should wait to play Valheim.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant. 

4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this bullshit is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market. 

Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed. 

Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game. 

TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of shit.",game filed dictionary definition missed potential let wind back time look began pubg released 2017 dominates market new battle royal game literally get everyone bright gaming light 144hz monitor play gun play tight issue performance cheating significant 4 year later suffering issue along new trouble invented listening community cheater refining core gameplay adding feature noone want asks expensive scam defining skin game defining characteristic game really shame bullshit best gun play fps market honestly issue forgive someone 2k hour great potential real defining problem significant problem blue ball aka brain dead developer never listened community ever since like month game community recognised red zone removed simply trimming bad map adding new mechanic ensure safer rotation focus med ammo instead wasted spawn fix suggested pilars community simply done quick patch yet devs double new map 500 skin patch always break game tl dr save 30 buck ring old pot smoking friend highschool still life mum basement moment hear voice crack recognise changed 10 year thing feel 4 year still playing pile shit

1260320,Party Animals,"My negative review doesn't fully display the picture, I'd love to be able to give this game a positive review to but don't think I can [b]yet.[/b] 
If you don't want to read the whole pros-cons list / essay, skip to the summary at the bottom.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
- Easy to find a game, never had to wait more than 2 minutes at any time.

- Super fun with friends, it's a better, bigger version of gang beasts. 

- Good variety of maps. modes & weapons to make things interesting.

- Characters are cute and charming, the IP colabs are really well done. 

- Lots of replay-ability, this has become my groups ""go-to"" game for the past week.

- Matches are quick and easy to drop in & out.

- Overall great party game.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
- No OCE/Aus or South America server, this makes the game very difficult to play with a ping of 160+ at least. If you're in this region you'll often find yourself starting match knocked out and all the other cons that come with playing on 180 ping.

- If you have a party of 3 we've found that it likes to consistently pair the same people up no matter who the party leader is or join order, it often leaves that third person the odd one out.

- Without frequent updates adding new maps, modes & weapons this game will probably not have much longevity, after 19 hours the magic is slowly starting to wear off.

- [b]Monetisation,[/b] don't really need to explain much more on this but after spending $30 on the game finding out skins you want are locked behind the combo of a store & mystery crates (in the form of eggs), leaves a little bit of a sour taste in your mouth, feels a lot like it's going to be made free-to-play at some stage.

- Overall toxicity, there's little censorship in the game, people can name themselves a variety of slurs without problem, but words like [i]Stinky[/i] & [i]Slayer[/i] are censored?

- No offline play, huge issue for a lot of people and the way they addressed it seemed quite disingenuous.


[h1]Summary: [/h1] The game has the building blocks to set it up to be amazing, it unfortunately falls short at the moment but it's nothing it can't fix.
The introduction of new servers, offline play, map & modes and removal of monetisation are all things that could be added or fixed in future updates.

[i]If[/i] you're someone who's on the fence about buying the game or your friends are trying to gaslight you into getting it even though you think you won't enjoy it, I'd say your best bet would be to wait a month or so and keep an eye on the updates & see if the reviews take an upturn. 

[i]If[/i] you have the disposable income, friends[i](optional)[/i] live somewhere there's a server & this won't stop you from buying another game this month, go for it. It's a super fun game best enjoyed with other people not focusing on being competitive I guarantee you'll have a good time.

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. 

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

 → Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
 → Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
 → Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
 → Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means). 
 → Controllers not working properly.
 → Game keeps minimising on PC. 
 → The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
 → Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes. 
 → Objectives not counting.
 → Not getting XP when completing objectives. 
 → The game freezes on the EA FC logo. 
 → Stuck in half-time animation.
 → Game-play stutter. 
 → Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware. 
 → Anti-cheat error message. 
 → Media questions still make 0 sense.
 → Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
 → Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
 → Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
 → If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run. 

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision.

1248130,Farming Simulator 22,"I've been playing this series since 2015 and as far as I'm concerned this is not only the best one yet, it's the one that's added the most useful features in one iteration.  For one, and I didn't see this mentioned in any of the professional reviews I read, the AI has had a massive and much needed overhaul.  In all previous versions of the game, the AI could only do field work, meaning a single player running a larger farm spent most of his time driving tractors to and fro, attaching and detaching implements, hauling product and supplies, etc.  If you wanted to automate any of those other tasks, you needed a mod called Courseplay, and then you spent more time dicking with menus and recording routes in Courseplay than you did farming, which greatly reduced the length of time it took for me to get bored and move on to other games.

However, the vanilla AI is now capable of being ordered to drive from one place to another without having to pre-record the route.  They can even be told to load product at one place (say, a silo) and deliver it to another (railroad or sell point) and repeat until done.  The end result is you spend a lot more time doing your fieldwork of choice and a lot less time driving across the map.

Another area of vast improvement is the addition of seasons.  This has had a couple major impacts on gameplay, all positive as far as I'm concerned.  In the older season-less versions, it made sense to plant the next crop right after you harvested the last one, which is unrealistic and immersion-breaking.  Now you must follow the in-game calendar and only plant and harvest specific crops during their designated seasons.  This not only gives a much more realistic workflow, it also has nice side benefits like seeing weeds grow among the harvested stubble while waiting for planting season, something you'd never see in the old versions where the planter follows right behind the combine.

Something unexpected that came with seasons is seasonal price changes for every commodity.  This appears to have replaced the old ""Great Demand"" and random price fluctuations of the old versions.  In the old games, you had to learn by experience what a good price for each commodity was and sell when it was higher than usual, or you could wait for a ""Great Demand"" and sell for a guaranteed good price for whatever commodity was in demand at that time, which is usually what I did, to get the most bang for my buck.  The problem with that system is that your ""pay day"" is completely random, it was common to go for long periods of time without a great demand for anything that you had, leaving you with the choice between waiting more and accepting a lower price.  The game now has predictable seasonal changes for every good, meaning you get paid every December, or every January, or whatever month happens to be prime month for what you're growing and manufacturing.

Speaking of manufacturing, that's another big feature of 22: Production Chains.  For every crop that can be grown (except maybe potatoes?) there is a corresponding production facility that will process it and turn it into something more valuable.  Grains get turned to flour; sunflowers, canola and olives get processed into oil; grapes get processed into raisins, which get added to sugar and corn to make cereal, the list goes on.  It's a neat way of increasing your payday without having to farm more ground, and it's just plain cool to see your trailers loaded up with pallets of various goods, headed to the supermarket.

Yet another new feature (at least I believe it's new) is the way vehicle maintenance is handled.  You've always had to repair your vehicles over time, but I believe this is the first version that increases maintenance costs as vehicles age, which is not only realistic, it also adds a new layer of decision-making to the game.  Do I keep pumping money into this old beater or bite the bullet and just replace it already?  Since I only need a combine once a year, would it actually be cheaper to lease it and return it immediately rather than keep it for decades and deal with the ever-increasing repair bills?  It's a small change that has a bigger impact than at first glance, and is all the more welcome for it.

All in all, this is a fantastic game and definitely the most ""mature"" of the series so far.  I'd recommend it to new players and old fans alike, with a slight warning to newbies that there is a lot to learn, but that's part of the fun, right?",playing series since 2015 far concerned best one yet one added useful feature one iteration one see mentioned professional review read ai massive much needed overhaul previous version game ai could field work meaning single player running larger farm spent time driving tractor fro attaching detaching implement hauling product supply etc wanted automate task needed mod called courseplay spent time dicking menu recording route courseplay farming greatly reduced length time took get bored move game however vanilla ai capable ordered drive one place another without pre record route even told load product one place say silo deliver another railroad sell point repeat done end result spend lot time fieldwork choice lot le time driving across map another area vast improvement addition season couple major impact gameplay positive far concerned older season le version made sense plant next crop right harvested last one unrealistic immersion breaking must follow game calendar plant harvest specific crop designated season give much realistic workflow also nice side benefit like seeing weed grow among harvested stubble waiting planting season something never see old version planter follows right behind combine something unexpected came season seasonal price change every commodity appears replaced old great demand random price fluctuation old version old game learn experience good price commodity sell higher usual could wait great demand sell guaranteed good price whatever commodity demand time usually get bang buck problem system pay day completely random common go long period time without great demand anything leaving choice waiting accepting lower price game predictable seasonal change every good meaning get paid every december every january whatever month happens prime month growing manufacturing speaking manufacturing another big feature 22 production chain every crop grown except maybe potato corresponding production facility process turn something valuable grain get turned flour sunflower canola olive get processed oil grape get processed raisin get added sugar corn make cereal list go neat way increasing payday without farm ground plain cool see trailer loaded pallet various good headed supermarket yet another new feature least believe new way vehicle maintenance handled always repair vehicle time believe first version increase maintenance cost vehicle age realistic also add new layer decision making game keep pumping money old beater bite bullet replace already since need combine year would actually cheaper lease return immediately rather keep decade deal ever increasing repair bill small change bigger impact first glance welcome fantastic game definitely mature series far recommend new player old fan alike slight warning newbie lot learn part fun right

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!

Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.

Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.

Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.

If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment; worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""

I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.

I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals. 

I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.

HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes. 

I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.

Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.

It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.

True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care. 

It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want. 

For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face.",updated review please note purely experience game stupid hour sunk completely critical game give credit couple thing notably gameplay like animation motion player fun control play normal gameplay speed feel great player responsive fun trying keep shape defensively especially ultimate difficulty practice get attacking satisfying like different dribbling style although r1 dribbling time review little overpowered even still happy possible dribble past player year game score lovely solo goal play purely offline currently located get good enough connection kind online experience however despite ea releasing update one combated biggest issue many many others face abhorrent optimisation leading stutter lag game crash would want know many hour spent trialling fix first time gaming experience encounter game play sometimes workaround fix thing temporarily upon next launch work unacceptable aware problem yet nothing changed well month released hell sort never required play game paid 80 feel like ea owe year salary amount work done game crook stutter kind game destroy pleasurable experience get imagine playing f1 game every corner stutter 3 second fix crashed entire neighbouring village caused 500 million worth damage say forget toss bin go football game need precision reaction timing important 3 second stutter intermittently match nobody seen feel like mugatu zoolander new era franchise fresh start allowed believe thing may different case offline mode think adding cut scene player winning balon nobody even speaks announcer freak open top bus parade trophy cool first time every single time understand play football game want play sit watch silent movie attempt making immersive disaster true promising idea introduced like tactical vision hiring coach manager mode thing bugged released imagine working new feature work properly mean fire coach lock game chance back actually hope get patched matter tell u already know care shame think put effort could really good game foundation gameplay heart good football game stop bunch fraggles develop offline game mode amount work put create team example uninspiring talking put work actually making comprehensive immersive career mode create team fantastic f1 game work circumstance manager mode football game want bothered read feel like mugatu zoolander really face

Although that itself was bugged, it revealed a HUGE issue that was put in by design.
Turns out, the traffic simulation, the economy simulation, and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other, which makes them all not really impressive at all.
Sims have jobs, but don't actually have to go to work. (Same with school)
Businesses need goods to operate, but don't actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system.
You can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers, in a game that is supposed to model traffic and ""create rush hours as your sims go about their lives"". Uhh, yeah, sure CO. 

""deep simulation"" they said over and over again. 
I feel deceived on this one, and quite frustrated that I didn't realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"The game has a lot of potential but is ran by people that don't have a vision and only care about themselves and what they think is best for the game.

I have played since 2016 Beta and have more than 10,000 hours of actual playtime on this (my personal account) and previously worked at BHVR on the game. If this was years ago.. I would have recommended the game without any question. However, with the game's current state and direction, I could never recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.

It's just going downhill and that's the reality of it. They are partnering with anyone in an attempt to stay relevant and keep quarterly stats up but that only lasts for a week and then it's back to being a dead game for the most part.

If you ever decide to work at this company, just note that your personal account is at high risk of being permanently banned if you are accused of anything and are wrongfully terminated as a result.

They will not only ban your dev account (which is fine) but your personal account as well, which is actual bullsh*t and petty. I'm living proof of this.

They won't conduct a proper and thorough investigation behind their claims before terminating an employee and will sh*t all over your 6-years of dedicated gameplay, time spent and work into a product that you once loved and cared for to the point that you even took a job to work on the game to make it better not just for yourself but for the community who also loves the game.

Clueless company making clueless decisions on a game that they're clueless about since they don't play it.

I was one of the literal few at the company who has more than 4,000 hours of actual gameplay in the game.

P.S. they still haven't fixed the IP leak vuln that has been the cause of people being DDoSed, doxed, swatted and much more. They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix.

Just to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years.

Still think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues.

Their priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts.

They would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of ""behaviour"" should not be condoned.

I'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place.

Cheaters? I won't get into that. Everyone knows the answer to this already. The company looks at them as paying customers that deserve respect (direct quote from an employee that's in a leadership role btw) and would rather keep them around than get rid of them entirely.

[i]TL; DR - Skip to the Verdict at the end of the review[/i]

A few of the available options are sliders for brightness, Master Volume, Music, SFX, Voices and Menus; Subtitles (OFF by default), Graphic quality, mappable controls, combat difficulty, and more.

Let me address the whispers of permadeath in the game - I died many times over, and my game was safe, so I can assure you that if you're terrible at combat, you will still be able to play and enjoy this game without worrying about losing all of your progress. 

Ninja Theory, the developers of Hellblade, made two games that I enjoyed immensely: [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkicoll/recommended/245280]ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West[/url][/b], a true gem with its gorgeous visuals and interesting story; and [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkicoll/recommended/220440]DmC: Devil May Cry[/url][/b] with its stylish and beautiful combat. When I heard that they were coming out with a new game, I was excited, anticipating something that would be an epic mixture of the best qualities of these two games.  What I got was not even close to what I had envisioned, bringing me something wholly unexpected.

So what IS the game like?

Reality.  Dark, gritty and full of inner turmoil.  Most games have a very cut-and-dried story line, with a clear antagonist to destroy.  It's not so straightforward in Hellblade... Senua's greatest enemy is her own shattered mind.  The devs did a brilliant job of handing an issue that is so sensitive that most people simply refuse to acknowledge it, much less make it the central focus of a AAA game.  I will come back to this a bit later, for now focusing on...
[b]
The Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay is story-based, with a lesser emphasis on combat.  All fights in the game come at scripted intervals - there are no random encounters or wandering enemies to accidentally bump into.  Senua can see patterns in the abstract around her, and by ""Focusing"", she can unlock or create new pathways to traverse.

Periodically you will need to seek out rune-shaped patterns in the surrounding area.  When you are close, you'll see glowing red shapes floating around you, indicating which rune you are nearby.  Other times, there are areas that look weird... blurry.  This is yet another kind of puzzle which can be solved by looking at it (focusing) from the right angle.  This is where having a controller gives you an edge, as it will vibrate when you are close to finding a piece of the missing shape or rune (assuming that you have the feature turned on.)

[b]Collectibles and Achievements[/b]

There is only one collectible in the game, which consists of finding ""[b]Lorestones[/b]"", and ""focusing"" upon them to hear a tale.  Basic exploration will reveal the lorestones, and I highly recommend seeking them out, as they not only expand the story, they also add a new layer of interest (I personally found some of the stories fascinating!) 

As this is a reality-based game, there is no ""fast-travel"" between areas, so explore well before moving on to a new location!  There is a button you can hold down to jog, which helps, and the game is semi-linear, so you don't have to worry about getting lost.  I say ""semi"" linear because you do have choices, at times, of which direction you're going to take, but in the end you'll have to complete everything in the area before you can move on.

Finding all 44 of the lorestones is the only [b]achievement[/b] that you'll have to work for, as the rest unlock through game progression.

[b]Battle[/b]

Senua is a fearsome opponent and great warrior - despite her slim stature - and the reason is actually explained as the story unfolds, so BRAVO for that, devs! *claps* I do love logic in my games ;D

You have five moves to choose from during combat:  [b]Fast strike, heavy strike, melee, block[/b] and [b]evade[/b].  The ""run"" button that usually makes Senua jog will allow you to [b]charge[/b] your enemies. I am not great at fighting in games, and I found that dodging was my best friend, greatly reducing my defeats.

When your mirror glows during battle, you can ""[b]focus[/b]"" to slow down your enemies and give you the upper hand.

The battles themselves are beautifully-choreographed, and I found myself frequently stopping the action to take screens.  There is a nice variety of enemies to fight, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and all intimidating to behold.

[b]The Sights[/b]

I thought that ENSLAVED and DmC had amazingly-realistic nuances and mannerisms for their characters, but Hellblade blows them both out of the water, adding a depth that makes you feel like you're in control of an actual movie.  It's not only here and there that the graphics look cinematic-quality -- it's EVERYWHERE! 

The blue paint on Senua's face makes her look odd - even cross-eyed at times - but as you play and the blue wears away, she looks pretty, even stunning at times.

Adding to the feeling that you're in a movie is the built-in [b]Photo Mode[/b].  You can enter photo mode at any time - even during most cutscenes!  Doing so will pause the action, and you can zoom in, out, move the camera approx. 20 yards in any direction, add photo effects, and much much more!  [b]TIP:[/b] If you enter photo mode during a cutscene, Senua will almost always be blurry.  Simply adjust the focus to 100% and find your perfect shot!

[b]The Sounds[/b]

It's not just the graphics that shine in this game, but the sounds as well.  Every utterance, every sound effect and every tick and hum you hear in the game is brilliantly-placed.  The acting is top-notch, and I especially loved the female narrator.  Senua's friend, Druth, really chewed up the carpet, but it worked with the stories that he was telling.

[b]The Story[/b]

I won't go into specifics, as I don't want to spoil the game for anyone, but I will touch upon a few things.  Senua's psychosis is central to the narrative, plunging us deep into her perceptions and fears.  Ninja Theory heavily researched the topic, bringing in not only neuroscientists, but people who experience psychosis to shed light on the subject from both sides of the coin.  The result is captivating, giving us a glimpse of what some people live with as a part of their daily lives.

I am not into gore, and though there is definitely some blood involved, it's handled in a way that never made me uncomfortable.  There is a definite psychological aspect aimed at us, the players.  There are moments that are frightening, creepy, downright unsettling... all of it pulling us even further into Senua's world.

[b]The Verdict[/b]

Hellblade is a game like no other, exploring mental illness in a setting that is rich in detail and fascinating in its delivery.  Everything about the experience is stunning, from the sounds to the acting to the superb graphics, and everything in between.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I've always asked myself, how can people play a game for 1000+ hours and then give it a thumbs down? 

Then I played PUBG.

The European servers are in tatters, ruined by cheaters. I log in to 4 or 5 new perm-ban reports each session, but nothing changes. Cheats are readily available and are pre-installed in internet cafes in many parts of the world. Hit the death cam to spectate a HUYATV or DOUYUTV account and watch them 6x spray you with an AK from 100 yards, every shot hitting you in the head.

And it's not, GET GUD or REKT M8 - it's just sad. It takes all of the fun out of the game. I've played for over 1000 hours, I've paid for season passes and I've been promised changes and improvements - it just isn't happening. The devs don't care about about their player base and they don't listen to feedback.

PUBG still offers something other BR games don't and this is the game I want to play. When this game is good, it's probably one of my favourite games ever - certainly the game I've played the most.

I can put up with bugs, I can put up with poor geometry and I can put up with not being the best player at this game. But I can't put up with cheats.

Don't REGION LOCK CHINA, build a better cheat engine. I will happily play against anyone from anywhere in the world, but I don't want to play against cheaters.

It makes me incredibly sad to have to give this game a thumbs down.

!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!

!!Update!!
Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) 

Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.

415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.

!!Update!!
Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.

230410,Warframe,"[h1]The Platinum must flow![/h1]
 
[h2]Oh boy.[/h2]
 
Before I can get into the nitty-gritty and answer the question of ""Should I play Warframe?"" let it be known that it's impossible to review the entirety of this game with the restriction imposed by Steam's review format. There are too many systems within it to cover them all. We can talk about what works and what doesn’t as a whole, but to truly dissect them we’d need one of those 6-hour-long YouTube videos that are all the rage these days.

The short answer: Yes, you should play it. It’s free, a lot of fun and doesn’t make you feel terrible if you never spend money on it. The long answer; here we go!

[h1]The good[/h1]
[h2] Audio, Visuals, Gameplay, Variety[/h2]

Warframe is an MMO, co-op, third-person shooter, taking place in our very own solar system, at an unimaginably distant point in time, where two major factions vie for control in the aftermath of a great war. Players take on the role of the Tenno – ancient warriors now needed more than ever to keep balance within the universe and protect innocents from the new war they find themselves in. The Tenno operate the titular Warframes, battlesuits with exceptional combat prowess, agility, and space magic.

After choosing your Warframe, you’re dropped into a tutorial where you learn the basics of Warframe’s excellent combat and movement systems. You get a primary, secondary, and melee weapon, and can switch between them on the fly. Each Warframe also has four unique abilities, ie. space magic. Although the game doesn’t have a combo meter, it is very evocative of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and similar hack-n-slash games. The movement is cathartic, as you can glide through the air, run on walls, slide, twirl, and generally parkour all over the place. It’s a lot of fun.

After the tutorial, you get your very own spaceship, from which you’ll be able to fly across the galaxy and participate in the abundant content Warframe offers. You can visit all of the planets in the Solar system, and then some. While some of them have open-world areas, the majority of Warframe’s game modes you’ll get to play will be standalone missions, such as Survival, Defense, Assassination, Excavation, etc. As you do so, you will be awarded crafting resources and blueprints on which to use them, usually for crafting new weapons and Warframes. You’ll also be awarded Mods, which you can equip on your equipment to modify its various stats.

You’ll also notice just how beautiful of a game Warframe is, with visuals that make me wonder just how in the world they keep the system requirements as low as they are. There are issues with how lighting works, as certain surfaces can be blindingly bright, but turn off Bloom and you should be good. The audio production is similarly brilliant, with excellent sound design that makes the combat punchy and satisfying, regardless of which weapon you’re using. It’s amazing how every single weapon, no matter if it’s a primary, secondary, or melee, can be auditorily distinct from another, and still sound amazing. The soundtrack has a fitting track for every situation, ranging from ethereal chants when the game is being mysterious, to faster-paced, drum-driven ones that compliment the combat. There’s a bit of inconsistency to it, as some are memorable enough to become known even outside of the game, while others are just something you probably won't think about outside of the moment it's playing.

[h1]The bad[/h1]
[h2]Progression, Difficulty, Story Quests, Design Philosophy[/h2]

So, after you’ve gotten acquainted with your ship and everything you can do around it, maybe progressed through a couple of planets, and tried doing a quest or two, the game opens up and provides very little information on what you’re supposed to do next. Don’t bother with figuring it out on your own, as that’ll only put you off. Look to the wiki and save yourself unnecessary frustration. After the first…40 hours, the game will click. You’ll find a weapon that works for you and continue progressing through the Star map, acquiring more gear and knowledge on the game as you go along, and getting to complete more and more story quests.

If you’re smart, unlike I was, you should probably stop around 400-500 hours, as Warframe’s problems become more apparent as progression continues. I believe that, first and foremost, Warframe was designed to keep player base retention. You may think that every game is, but no. As a free-to-play title, Warframe most likely relies on players to keep coming back; as they invest more and more time into it, the more likely they are to invest money as well. Other, paid titles, won’t mind how many hours you put in since you pay up-front. Warframe isn’t bad in this regard, as pretty much anything that can be bought with Platinum (the game's premium currency) can be grinded for, as you can trade Platinum with other players, so there’s a strong trading economy at play here - but you wouldn't know it from the in-game market. 

The very progression is stop-and-go, as each piece of gear has its own level. As you level them up, so does your overall account level, called Mastery, increase – granting you access to more content and weapons. You’re encouraged to keep swapping between them, instead of getting more powerful with one – which you will have to do as well, at some point. Once this stops at Mastery level 16, you’ve pretty much encountered the hardest Warframe has to throw at you, and you still have another 24 levels to go, with new ones being added as the number of equipment in the game grows. Past that point, all you’re doing is increasing numbers and figuring out the most efficient way of farming for new stuff. You might not mind it as much, but know that the game wasn’t designed with a point of finality in mind, but for you to keep coming back, again and again, to keep grinding and completing content, without much substance to it. Enemies become trivial, as a single press of a button can wipe out entire rooms. Level-design becomes non-existent, as you spam the bullet jump maneuver to blaze through levels as fast as possible, so you can try again if that piece of loot you need didn’t drop.

As such, the developers prioritize new, replayable content to get older players into the grind again. At the same time, it has to be accessible to newer players, so it can’t be made too difficult. Story quests suffer especially, as they’re not designed with replayability in mind. The main plot of Warframe still isn’t finished, and it’s been three years since the previous major quest had been added. There’s a lot of wasted potential here, especially with some of the characters, as such a game can’t really have character development. There's simply no room for it as things need to stay static—characters are bereft of their arcs and remain the same for the sake of replayable missions and grind. 

It might keep all those boxes in your mind ticked so you feel accomplished. I know I did way past a point I should have, but looking back at a good part of those 995 hours, and it feels like time wasted.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"Diablo 4 didn't respect my time so I'll keep this *somewhat* short and sum up the main points to decide if this is the game for you:

[Edit January 1, 2024]: I've 95%ed the game (Didn't finish the last tier of the season completely), I now feel even more confident in my review being negative. I had just as much fun pointing and clicking in Syberia: The World Before (Masterclass game), as I did pointing and clicking in D4. This is truly a bells and whistles mobile game with as bare game play as is required to reel consumers in. I spent $0 in their shop, horrible practices. Events are just color changes for enemies/regions, everything else is 100% identical. Aside from the end-game boss loot targeting, there still isn't anything else as mentioned. So the review still stands, and I've now deleted the character completely with no way to recover it, thanks but no thanks Blizzard.

- Fun, basic gameplay, with a boring gameplay loop that lacks dopamine hits.
*Each class has 4 builds which can be mix and matched.
*Sacred Ancestral Unique gear only matches some builds.
*Corpses have a small max limit for 2023, damaging two specific builds.
*Forgetful, throwaway music, but is good nonetheless and gets the job 'done.'
*Gameplay feels over a decade behind the times, lacks innovation.
*Inscribing items is the exact same function as the Horadric Cube.
*Enchanting items is 5 steps backwards in this game. You can't see what you can change on the affix until you've spent your material and you can't refund them if you choose no affix.
*All Armor Sets (Green) were removed and sold in the Shop (with no bonus).
*All cool armor & weapon effects from epic sets in past games or even Path of Exile, $. Not a single one for free. Not one.
*Archon, Boneweave, and Sovereign armor sets are 99% identical, most sets look pretty similar as well to goad you into the shop.
*Game freezes on occasion when loading near other players (when streaming them in).

- Feels like the game was made by people who don't play video games.
*Always something to do, but always lacking dopamine hits, i.e., the loot is only ever incrementally good except when first accessing a new world difficulty tier.
*Altars of Lilith can be completely ignored unless min/maxing as the upgrades give mathematical negative returns almost immediately, regardless of the level scaling.
*Mining Ores and doing Herbalism (you just click the deposit/herb, then pick up the item) is required to upgrade Gear and Potions, respectively.
*PvP is both Optional (open mouse wheel -> scroll right -> apply Blood Mark) even in the 2 PvP areas and broken due to a flat '92% damage reduction buff,' which means if you did 5,000 damage now you do 400 (8 x 5000) / 100 , so you still kill someone in 1-3 seconds depending on your class and theirs.
*PvP marked for blood (enables pvp) can glitch out, preventing you from attacking others but enabling them to attack you (when the glitch occurs, you will not have the particle effect so you won't even know). When glitched you must logout to remove the mark.
*PvP is markedly unfinished and poorly thought out, you can reduce pvp damage further by 30% for 20 seconds, but this requires cutting your screen in half with your inventory, then clicking on a tiny box (all mid-battle most likely), then right clicking on a scroll.
*PvP is unbalanced for every class and every build, each fight lasting a second, maybe two.
*I enjoyed the 'Open World' aspect. From a 3D Designer point of view, it isn't really open world, they simply took 5 Acts of areas and stitched them together, removing the loading screen and mostly hand-crafting the over-world. When taken in this way, the world map isn't really that big, and we loved this, even if it creates a lack of cohesion for the player from a world building perspective (i.e., you can cross Estuar in minutes).
*Minus copy paste 'special' bosses to climb the season chapters (which I didn't finish), you have Helltides (Tier 3/4) for targeting loot, Obols (all tiers/from events) for targeting loot, and Nightmare Dungeons (Tier 3/4) for upgrading Paragon board sigils (same function as upgrading gems at the end of a D3 Greater Rift).
*Season and in-game content builds on Diablo Immortal, for better or worse, i.e., to complete the Season 2 content, you have to climb to Tier 3 at the least.
*The loot you get is the same everywhere, nothing has a specific loot table, minus first time kill rewards, for example, Echo of Lilith.
*Tired, boring, cliched, copy-paste story line, trying to be something it's not. Loved Lilith, hated the plot existing to move me from A to B.
*Hitting enemies lacks responsive feedback, they just jitter slightly, flash white/silver, or fight right through it.
*Sounds of hitting enemies with the physical weapons is lackluster.
*Boring, copy paste Affixes for gear.
*Great side quests; Horrible voice acting outside the Main Quest. Shameful, especially horrendous as I played Baldur's Gate 3 for 181 hours before this game so it stuck out like a sore thumb.

- Store front with skins priced at $38.41 CAD after tax for 1 cosmetic armor set.
*Horse armor selling for $23.14 after tax, and WE ALL complained about Bethesda, hah!
*Prices normalized by American Companies & Consumers, pressured and forced onto everyone else due to how the global currency exchange works and has functioned for generations; some companies eat this exchange to increase spending in lower GDP countries, see Fatshark with Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, which eats roughly 56% of the conversion rate for the consumer, and this is but one alternative method of targeted pricing as there are many profitable ways to go about this.
*No 'Statistics' based research has been used (mathematically even if less than 0.1% buy macrotransactions from Diablo 4's store, they make Real Profit), no transparency between professionals and corporations, every game with MTX stores share the same pricing, same scheme, except D4's store lacks 'FOMO' or, Fear of Missing Out, i.e., the shop lacks items and will rotate every item every 24 hours, some into the same slot, some down to the bottom, some up to the recommended. If you feel inclined to buy, just wait, you will never lose out and they never remove items from the shop.
*Game that has soft-lock issues where not enough enemies spawn carrying Animus on occasion.
*Waiting in queue indefinitely, soft-locking in queue, login soft-lock.
*Item windows and comparison windows constantly flash on occasion (appear and disappear) with no apparent fix or cause.
*Enemies die standing up and their model doesn't disappear. Haven't seen any T-posing, they just die with their idle animation active until you log out. Happens frequently in the Blood Harvest seasonal event.

Made it to level 54 HC Necro, 70 SC Necro Tier4, Lack of dopamine in Helltides, World Loot is God Loot, Same Dungeon Spam.
Completed exactly 5.5 Chapters of the season journey.
Got bored looking at all the copy paste armor sets in the 'free' game.
Didn't buy any Macrotransactions: 
People listen, I'm in Sociology, I do Statistics, I love Math & Logic, and these are *not* microtransactions.
Micro = small
Macro = large
$5 USD or $7 CAD would be a microtransaction in this case.
When the transaction is half or 2/3 or 3/4 the price of a video game, this is called a macrotransaction.
This game has macrotransactions, there are no microtransactions in the store.

It's an egregious business model and I have deleted all my characters and uninstalled.
I can't recommend the game even though I sometimes enjoyed my time with it because there is only so much abuse consumers can and should take before looking to invest their hard earned disposable income elsewhere.

These are just my subjective ramblings of this 40 year old.
You decide if it's for you in the long run.
Oh, and wait for a sale if you want to buy, the game is frequently on sale for -40% off.

2198510,New Cycle,"I got to the end after 20 hours. Overall it is a good game and has a lot of potential in the future. 
Things I like:
+ Beautiful graphic: well designed in every aspect.
+ Engaging Gameplay: I play in hard mode with some customs like the low chance of disaster. Because disaster occurs very often in normal chance and makes me lose concentration. 
+ Good dramatic music.
+ Good mechanic.

Something I think needs to be improved:
+ Campaign Ending: It just pops up a story sheet so it feels a little bit rushed. It doesn't count how many people were saved and how many people died to create a future for humanity. And the game just ended, with no continuous play. I think it is good to turn the the campaign into sandbox mode and let the player continue to play after the ending.
+ Some way to control the population. The birthrate keeps growing with no way to control it. Maybe they need to be kept in line with the housing slot.
+ A better way to bury the death. I can see the cemetery will be a headache at the endgame. ",got end 20 hour overall good game lot potential future thing like beautiful graphic well designed every aspect engaging gameplay play hard mode custom like low chance disaster disaster occurs often normal chance make lose concentration good dramatic music good mechanic something think need improved campaign ending pop story sheet feel little bit rushed count many people saved many people died create future humanity game ended continuous play think good turn campaign sandbox mode let player continue play ending way control population birthrate keep growing way control maybe need kept line housing slot better way bury death see cemetery headache endgame

648800,Raft,"Just ""finished"" the game.

[b]The Good[/b]
As with most survival games, the early game is where much of the excitement lies, while discovering everything for the first time.

The Shark.  Love it/hate it.  It's a great mechanic to keep the pressure on.  Although the pressure lessens greatly as you move towards ""end game"" (more on this later).   Some people in the forums have complained that the shark is to trope-y and furthers a ""harmful"" stereotype about sharks.  I can see this easily being remedied with other nemesis creatures stopping by (giant squid anyone?).

Building the raft is fun.  It sort of reminds me of the old school Minecraft skyblock variant.  


[b]The not so good[/b]
Inventory management is a chore.

Getting to the ""end game"" is gratifying, but after that the both the reason for continuing on and the replay value tanks.  I'm assuming the devs are planning for content beyond the current end-game stage to remedy this.

The shark returns too quickly after death.  I think it should also be more difficult to kill the shark so the reward (a longer break from shark harrassment) should increase with the risk.

It bothered me that I couldn't build on islands.  It also bothered me that I couldn't create a ""skiff"" (second raft) for excursions.  Everything in this game must be attached to the starting raft.

It's odd that all the sea life, except the shark and the odd clam, is not visible in the water.  I'm catching fish left and right; never see one in the water...?

There are some game mechanic/balance issue that, once discovered, make the game trivially easy.  These need to be addressed.

[The conclusion]
Solid early access game.  Has a lot of potential and room to grow.  Hope the devs keep moving along that path.",finished game b good b survival game early game much excitement lie discovering everything first time shark love hate great mechanic keep pressure although pressure lessens greatly move towards end game later people forum complained shark trope furthers harmful stereotype shark see easily remedied nemesis creature stopping giant squid anyone building raft fun sort reminds old school minecraft skyblock variant b good b inventory management chore getting end game gratifying reason continuing replay value tank assuming devs planning content beyond current end game stage remedy shark return quickly death think also difficult kill shark reward longer break shark harrassment increase risk bothered build island also bothered create skiff second raft excursion everything game must attached starting raft odd sea life except shark odd clam visible water catching fish left right never see one water game mechanic balance issue discovered make game trivially easy need addressed conclusion solid early access game lot potential room grow hope devs keep moving along path

1144200,Ready or Not,"Just when everyone thought 2021 was over in terms of relevant releases, [i]Ready or Not[/i] appeared out of thin air. Well, not exactly out of thin air. People knew it was coming, and it has been under development for a while now, but [i]Void Interactive[/i] was being rather secretive with the early access release date, throwing people off the scent with a [i]Twitter[/i] post two days before the public EA release with the classic “it just might come out this year”. And it did. 

[i]Ready or Not[/i], or [b]RoN[/b] like people usually refer to it, is a tactical shooter in the making, that promises to eventually become just as good as the legendary [i]SWAT 4[/i] from [i]Irrational Games[/i]. Your character is a [i]SWAT[/i] operator and your job is to arrest or kill bad guys, make sure civilians are safe and apprehend drugs, illegal weapons, destroy human trafficking schemes, and so on. The usual tactical police stuff, done brilliantly. You can either play alone with four AI-controlled teammates or cooperatively with up to four teammates, with the twist that there’s no friendly AI to offer a hand or two, meaning that heading to the mission with just one or two friends will be rather challenging. The enemy count varies per map and it’s often dependent on the environment: some will naturally have a higher civilian to bad guy ratio due to its sheer likeliness while the opposite also occurs. Currently, there are five different maps to choose from, with an extra two [i]WIP[/i] environments, still untextured and ridden with glitches. Granted, it’s still an early access title and more maps are going to be released, along with full modding support so that the community can also help provide extra content to warrant unlimited hours of fun.

As far as content is concerned, there isn’t a lot just yet, but the variety is good enough to allow different approaches to each mission so that the replay factor is nearly endless. From your average M4 rifle to a paintball gun (yup), they got you covered. The gear list is also rather extensive, with different vests, masks, cop paraphernalia like battering rams, breaching shotguns, C2 explosives, flashbangs, even a camera thing that allows you to look under doors. Who’d ever imagine that voyeurism could be used to enforce law and order!

As it couldn’t be any different with an [i]Early Access[/i] title, some things still do not work as expected, an OK thing if it gets fixed, and it probably will. The AI can be rather unpredictable sometimes, with civilians running from you, sometimes locking themselves in rooms with the enemies, or just straight up hiding from you and making your mission take a lot longer because you and your friends end up forced to play tridimensional [i]“Where’s Wally?”[/i].  Something else that might annoy you ever so slightly is the fact that civilians and enemies don’t have a lot of different voice lines, meaning you will hear the same sentences over and over even during the very same mission. Granted, it’s probably a placeholder. On that same note, the cop’s voice is way too calm, which differs a lot from real-life operator footage telling bad guys to drop their weapons. But once again, a placeholder card probably applies. 

The gameplay aspect is where [i]RoN[/i] truly shines, sporting the possible best gunplay on the market, shootouts are dynamic and challenging. The AI can be very accurate at times, making it so you and your friends got to be on the very edge, with eyes wide open. It doesn’t take much to die, just like in real life. You are not a bullet sponge, nor are the enemies or civilians. As a matter of fact, civilians are even more fragile, so be mindful of that and take extra care when breaching into a room with thugs and civvies inside. That’s where the tactical element comes into play and cohesive play rewards you, while recklessness can be punishing. There are multiple ways to approach the different situations that you will be faced with and no right answers. Go with your guts, trial and error, or develop standard operating procedures with your friends so that everyone knows what to do and what not to do to get things done the cleanest way possible. It’s easier said than done, as [i]Ready or Not[/i] is very hard and will give you a tough time if you are not paying enough attention. The sheer unpredictability makes for very fun and engaging gameplay. 

It would be interesting to have a little more dynamism on certain stuff, like objective items that always spawn at a fixed location, making it so you always know where to go and how to get there efficiently without major hiccups, which is good from a speedrunning standpoint but doesn’t help when it comes to longevity, because it will get repetitive quickly. On the other hand, enemy spawn points are always random, with no mission playing the same, even if the items will always spawn at the very same location. Just like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.

Visually, [i]RoN[/i] is impressive. Powered by [i]Unreal Engine 4[/i], it certainly does not disappoint with textures, lighting, level design, and performance. It doesn’t take much to run, and my old faithful [i]RTX 2070[/i] could easily run it on epic settings in 1080p, well above 100 fps, with eventual drops here and there. As expected from any so-called next-generation title, it supports [i]DLSS[/i], which boosts the overall performance quite significantly, up to 40% even in sub-4K resolutions, without compromising the visual acuity, meaning no ghosting, no artifacts, as clear as it can be. A really solid implementation, even more so considering it’s still a work in progress.

It’s no exaggeration to say that [i]Ready or Not[/i] is perhaps one of the most solid early access releases ever. As much as it still has a lot of things that are not quite up to standard yet, the gameplay mechanics and the challenge are enough to keep you coming back for more. A breath of fresh new air into a genre that we haven’t seen much from, apart from [i]Zero Hour[/i]. It was a long, painful wait, but SWAT 4’s spiritual successor is finally among us and it’s great.

When I first loaded Dominions 6, for a moment I thought I opened the wrong game- it looked identical to Dominions 5, when designing my god the options seemed identical (again, I'm not a hardcore Dominions player, so maybe some stuff changed but it was minor enough that I didn't notice), when I looked at the unit summary for my faction it seemed identical to the prior game. I genuinely minimized the game to double-check that I'd launched Dominions 6 rather than Dominions 5. Once the game began I noticed that some of the icons were in a different location, other than that it felt very similar.  While playing you could identify some differences but, as a casual player, nothing major.

If you're a hardcore Dominions player, I'm sure you'll recognize and appreciate numerous changes that I'm not noticing or valuing.  If, however, you're like me and are a casual player who just enjoyed Dominions 5 and thought it was a cool game but never got super into it, then save your money and stick with Dominions 5.

I wish I could give a neutral review because there's nothing I dislike about Dominions 6, it just feels so similar to Dominions 5 (for a casual player) that I can't recommend this game to anyone that isn't already a hardcore player (or who doesn't own any iteration of Dominions yet).  If this was a $15 DLC for Dominions 5, I'd more more willing to recommend it. It just doesn't feel different enough from its predecessor to justify being a standalone game (in some ways it feels more like a large update than a DLC even).  Candidly, it felt like less changed from D5 to D6 than the changes you'd see in a DLC or free update from a Paradox game.",game wish middle option besides thumb thumb context hardcore dominion player first played dominion 5 last year thought impressive saw dominion 6 releasing excited first loaded dominion 6 moment thought opened wrong game looked identical dominion 5 designing god option seemed identical hardcore dominion player maybe stuff changed minor enough notice looked unit summary faction seemed identical prior game genuinely minimized game double check launched dominion 6 rather dominion 5 game began noticed icon different location felt similar playing could identify difference casual player nothing major hardcore dominion player sure recognize appreciate numerous change noticing valuing however like casual player enjoyed dominion 5 thought cool game never got super save money stick dominion 5 wish could give neutral review nothing dislike dominion 6 feel similar dominion 5 casual player recommend game anyone already hardcore player iteration dominion yet 15 dlc dominion 5 willing recommend feel different enough predecessor justify standalone game way feel like large update dlc even candidly felt like le changed d5 d6 change see dlc free update paradox game
1627720,Lies of P,"For a ""Souls-like"" game that is not from From Software, this is a very good game. I'll write down some thoughts after 35h and beating the game. Of course, no spoilers.


Basically, combine Bloodborne + Sekiro with a twist of Pinnochio story, and you have Lies of P.

- Story is nice, but don't expect a big inmersion unless you explore the lore (like in Souls games). The twist of the classical tale with a more dark atmosphere is interesting enough though.

- Gameplay is really good, but it feels clunky and slow in the early hours due to some of the perks being locked behind the skill tree (that unlocks after beating the second boss). Unlike Sekiro, you can decide if you want to go full parry against enemies/bosses, or just dodge in a more Bloodborne fashion, or both. 
There are a lot of tools to create unique gameplay, like the weapon assembly, fable arts, different arms with upgrades, etc. Overall, fairly complete to provde a lot of options for a lot of tastes.

- Soundtrack I'd say is generally good/very good, but In my opinion there wasn't any theme that was ""amazing"" in terms of standing out over the rest like in other souls games. But as I said, overall very good orchestral/choir music for bosses, and some areas have nice ambiental music too.

- Difficulty is, in my opinion higher at almost every part of the game, than any other souls game. There are a lot of 2 phase bosses, even in early hours that will make you struggle quite a bit. I felt that overall there was an unbalanced difficulty curve throughout the game, specially in boss fights, that made me feel it was ""unfair"". 

- Boss fights were overall very well done. Challenging, designs were overall good and their moveset and mechanics were varied enough. I felt though, that some battles were a bit ""overloaded"" and felt ""unfair"", like a certain boss in a big bridge. I beat them all without summons (personal choice) so I guess with summons the fights would be significantly easier. 2 phase bosses were very challenging and overall I felt that they were way more difficult than your ""typical"" souls boss.

- Graphics were nice and optimization very good. I have a high end GPU, but I have some friends with a 2060 for example and the game ran very well for them without fps drops.

Overall a solid 8.5-9 /10. Neowiz really did their homework when creating this game. I hope to see more of this from them in the future.

648800,Raft,"Would I reccommend this game?  Yeah, you know, I would:  If you can play it with a person.  And maybe on easy.  Definitely on easy on your own.

Listen, listen, I know.  You're a proud gamer, you don't play crap on easy.  I get it.  My save game is called ""easy mode offends me"".  And yet, there it is, that's what I did.

Basically, there's not a lot of dangerous foes for the most part, not until much, much later in the game anyway.  I mean, there's a shark, yeah, so you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft.  (And then lure him into shallow water, throw bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpoke.)

So, really, the challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst.  On normal, especially early in the game, it feels like all you're doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst.  It's kinda tedious, frankly.  So on easy, that gets turned down.  The shark will still shark you as hard as ever, the sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirst, but the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other things.

It's a pretty good coop implementation.  My bestest gaming buddy (who is also my wife and reads these things--hello!) and I sort of appreciate the slow wafting across the ocean, scavenging flotsam, building up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things.  Playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise. It's just you, the ocean, tiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longer.

Rventually, when you have enough technology and you're not purely at the whims of the ocean, a plot starts to reveal itself, with places to explore.  We love exploring.

So in the end, or if you were looking for one of those fashionable TL;DRs, this is a slow-paced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most part, appreciating the ocean, fishing up the tiniest sardines, and slowly wafting to the next adventure.",would reccommend game yeah know would play person maybe easy definitely easy listen listen know proud gamer play crap easy get save game called easy mode offends yet basically lot dangerous foe part much much later game anyway mean shark yeah stay raft stab sharky face try nibble raft lure shallow water throw bait repeatedly poke sharp stick expires deathpoke really challenge mostly managing hunger thirst normal especially early game feel like boiling little thimblesful water cooking tiniest sardine character cusp dying gothic faminethirst kinda tedious frankly easy get turned shark still shark hard ever sardine tiny thimble water still fail slake thirst thirst hunger meter deplete le quickly actually time go thing pretty good coop implementation bestest gaming buddy also wife read thing hello sort appreciate slow wafting across ocean scavenging flotsam building bigger raft inventing sharper pokesticks fend thing playing somebody nice game stupendously lonely otherwise ocean tiny atoll occasionally detritus somebody year ago longer rventually enough technology purely whim ocean plot start reveal place explore love exploring end looking one fashionable tl drs slow paced game kind relaxing part appreciating ocean fishing tiniest sardine slowly wafting next adventure
548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"UPDATED FOR 2023

My review is lengthy, so I'll preface my paragraphs with a TL;DR:

1. Can I have fun on Day 1? 
Yes. Jump right in. From Haz 1 to Haz 4 you can succeed with no upgrades or leveling.
Just use good teamwork.

2. How's the shooting?
Most excellent. Some of the most satisfying gunplay I've experienced in years as a shooter-game guy.

3.Difficulty?
Fair and skill-based. You won't be out-leveling your foes with raw stats here. Aim well and PAY ATTENTION to your environment.

4.Classes?
Well balanced and uniquely fun.

5.World?
Incredibly varied and gorgeous. You'll need to learn a bit of platforming to figure out your next jump. Do it quickly, the horde approaches!

6. Enemies? 
As varied as the environments. All dangerous. All fun to shoot. 

7. Missions? 
Enough to keep things interesting and challenging in their own right. 

8. Levels, upgrades, grind, and endgame?

Leveling is decently fast, and you unlock the fun stuff at a respectable pace as well.

You'll acquire everything you want at a decent pace that rewards you adequately for your time. 

Endgame missions (Deep Dives) are a fun test of personal prowess and your skills as a team!

Even after acquiring everything, they remain a fun test of your dwarven moxxy.

There is an element of randomness to acquiring the coveted overclocks these missions grant, which can be vexing due to the large loot pool. The devs have implemented other ways to acquire them, and this issue of acquisition has been acknowledged. I don't believe these systems hurt the overall fun of DRG though. 

As for ways to spend your money further - there's a refreshing lack of GACHA and FOMO involved. 

There IS a Season Pass system, but it's entirely free, and what you don't unlock (you have several months to do it by filling a big XP bar) gets added to the random loot pool for you to acquire on your own time.


Now then, on to my big sales pitch...

What I love about Deep Rock Galactic is that this game lacks a lot of the trifling, tedious things most modern games like to throw at you. 

This isn't an endless quest of RNG loot grinding a la Borderlands. You can pick up and play this without fretting that you're missing out on a full season of shallow rewards, cash shop exclusives, and time limited gear that is only relevant for that month's balance patch.

Day 1 presents you with four unique classes which all play differently, with unique guns and terrain traversal tools which synergize between each other to help you mine, dig, and hunt down your objectives. 

Yes, there is leveling, resource gathering, and upgrades in the form of loadout upgrades and dwarf perks. However, the quest to these is a steady, well paced adventure that encourages you to journey inside ALL biomes, each of which present unique obstacles to traverse. 

From Hazard 1 (easiest difficulty) to Hazard 4 (highest before unlocking Hazard 5) you can succeed with no perks, upgrades, or even an hour spent on any one dwarf. All you need is situational awareness, a non-toxic attitude, (really, the playerbase is great!) and good shooting.
Which brings me to the most important thing - 

The gunplay is excellent! 

Every weapon feels and sounds good. You're often asked to aim not just straight ahead, but up, down, at every wall, even the empty air. The enemy is everywhere, and it is endless. A continuous, remorseless horde of jaws and fangs that come from nowhere, in forms as varied as the eerie, sodden, frigid, hellish, and irradiated landscapes you will struggle through to reach either the mission's end - or your own. 

It can't be understated how integral the terrain is to gameplay. These aren't just randomly generated tunnels with some dips and ledges to make things a little more interesting. The formulae at which terrain is generated spawns places both beautiful yet also steeply treacherous and labyrinthine. You'll need your wits to safely navigate these, and bravery when the swarm descends. 

You aren't just shooting your way out, you're thinking on your feet as you platform over gaping chasms and vault yourself over erupting fire pits, the horde behind you immolated on the spot where you just were by a magma jet. It's gripping. It's tense... But the pacing is kind enough to offer you enough quiet moments to appreciate the glowing grandeur of towering crystals and glittering salt spires you may freely climb. 

Best part is it's all destructible. Dig it out into a defensive trench. Drill yourself an escape tunnel to reach a lost friend. Bait your enemies into a meadow of explosive fungus flowers... Or fall to your death down a very, very deep hole. There's a lot of possibilities under planet Hoxxes that require you to adapt quickly and think on your feet with the tools and guns provided to you. 

Customization is fun. There's an in-game shop with NO microtransactions whatsoever. You spend the gold you earn and the resources you've mined to buy yourself new beards, armor suits, and even skin colors. 

Along the way the game will also reward you with shinies to uncover in the environments themselves. 
Cargo Crates to uncover weapon skins, lost helmets with coordinates to backpacks holding armor skins or cosmetic pickaxe parts.
 
You aren't charged an extra dime for any of this. Only a bit of your time and courage. There are DLC packs that are purely cosmetic, and the soundtracks are quite good too! These don't impact gameplay and are just to support the devs!

The endgame isn't especially hard to arrive at, but it does require you practice the good habits you've learned along the way. Team work, efficient terrain traversal, and good aim, in a series of longer missions full of double-objectives and heightened enemy spawns. 

The rewards are Overclocks. Perks ranging from mundane and convenient to lopsided and peculiar. These will either do boring things like increase your ammo - or make your glowing line of plasma spin around like crazy and cut up everything in front of you. 

They're fun but unnecessary. My advice? Don't treat the endgame like a grind to slog through. Don't look at your upgrades and cosmetics as a checklist. Take the Season as something to nibble on instead of power up.

Experience the adventure. Revel in the solid core mechanics which make this an excellent shooter to dive into. 

Appreciate Deep Rock Galactic for what it is - an honest reprieve from a game genre filled with unrewarding tedium made to wring you of your dollars.",updated 2023 review lengthy preface paragraph tl dr 1 fun day 1 yes jump right haz 1 haz 4 succeed upgrade leveling use good teamwork 2 shooting excellent satisfying gunplay experienced year shooter game guy 3 difficulty fair skill based leveling foe raw stats aim well pay attention environment 4 class well balanced uniquely fun 5 world incredibly varied gorgeous need learn bit platforming figure next jump quickly horde approach 6 enemy varied environment dangerous fun shoot 7 mission enough keep thing interesting challenging right 8 level upgrade grind endgame leveling decently fast unlock fun stuff respectable pace well acquire everything want decent pace reward adequately time endgame mission deep dive fun test personal prowess skill team even acquiring everything remain fun test dwarven moxxy element randomness acquiring coveted overclocks mission grant vexing due large loot pool devs implemented way acquire issue acquisition acknowledged believe system hurt overall fun drg though way spend money refreshing lack gacha fomo involved season pas system entirely free unlock several month filling big xp bar get added random loot pool acquire time big sale pitch love deep rock galactic game lack lot trifling tedious thing modern game like throw endless quest rng loot grinding la borderland pick play without fretting missing full season shallow reward cash shop exclusive time limited gear relevant month balance patch day 1 present four unique class play differently unique gun terrain traversal tool synergize help mine dig hunt objective yes leveling resource gathering upgrade form loadout upgrade dwarf perk however quest steady well paced adventure encourages journey inside biome present unique obstacle traverse hazard 1 easiest difficulty hazard 4 highest unlocking hazard 5 succeed perk upgrade even hour spent one dwarf need situational awareness non toxic attitude really playerbase great good shooting brings important thing gunplay excellent every weapon feel sound good often asked aim straight ahead every wall even empty air enemy everywhere endless continuous remorseless horde jaw fang come nowhere form varied eerie sodden frigid hellish irradiated landscape struggle reach either mission end understated integral terrain gameplay randomly generated tunnel dip ledge make thing little interesting formula terrain generated spawn place beautiful yet also steeply treacherous labyrinthine need wit safely navigate bravery swarm descends shooting way thinking foot platform gaping chasm vault erupting fire pit horde behind immolated spot magma jet gripping tense pacing kind enough offer enough quiet moment appreciate glowing grandeur towering crystal glittering salt spire may freely climb best part destructible dig defensive trench drill escape tunnel reach lost friend bait enemy meadow explosive fungus flower fall death deep hole lot possibility planet hoxxes require adapt quickly think foot tool gun provided customization fun game shop microtransactions whatsoever spend gold earn resource mined buy new beard armor suit even skin color along way game also reward shinies uncover environment cargo crate uncover weapon skin lost helmet coordinate backpack holding armor skin cosmetic pickaxe part charged extra dime bit time courage dlc pack purely cosmetic soundtrack quite good impact gameplay support devs endgame especially hard arrive require practice good habit learned along way team work efficient terrain traversal good aim series longer mission full double objective heightened enemy spawn reward overclocks perk ranging mundane convenient lopsided peculiar either boring thing like increase ammo make glowing line plasma spin around like crazy cut everything front fun unnecessary advice treat endgame like grind slog look upgrade cosmetic checklist take season something nibble instead power experience adventure revel solid core mechanic make excellent shooter dive appreciate deep rock galactic honest reprieve game genre filled unrewarding tedium made wring dollar

1966720,Lethal Company,"I don't know what comparison to draw to explain the games mechanics. It's a survival horror but it doesn't fall into a monster hunt category like Phas. 
This game does allow for players to make their own fun as well, it does not have to be hardcore at all if you don't want it to be. Its very socially comparable maybe to Among Us although I was not a fan of that game. 

This game is about collecting scrap. The objective is to meet an ever climbing quota in 3 days which makes it run based, after failure to meet quota you restart. There is a shop you can spend money at for cosmetics or useful items. Because you need to hold everything in this game it means you really gotta plan with your team what you're going to take with you (If you're going for long runs) otherwise you'll find yourself short and you might find yourself being introduced to the companies disciplinary measures for lazy workers. 

Each monster has audio queues to recognise and methods of detection that you will have to play around. Giants have very keen sight but pick up on movement and don't hear well.
Dogs can't see at all but they're fast and chase after sound. 
I'll leave it at that for now but there are methods to dispatch/avoid the various creatures and most don't feel alike to deal with. This also makes monster combos something to really keep in mind when setting up your teams load out. 

There are 3 tiers of maps based off difficulty/reward. The final tier require that you pay(Not real money) to get in but these maps are required for making it into later quotas for long runs. These are also the maps you'll run into monster combos, a real challenge when your making your way past the 1500-2000 quota range. Before that difficulty takes a bit of time to climb, don't be surprised to see 1 go running in solo and making quota alone for the first 6 or so days. 


I've played Phas and a bunch of its clones (Some better honestly than phas itself) but I still like this game way better than all of them. 
If you found waiting around in Phasmophobia for the information to basically come to you was boring then I think you'll enjoy this game much more. You have limited time in a day so your actually fighting the clock to be more efficient until you can't keep up. 
I personally don't want to sit around waiting in a survival horror until I can progress because then I'm relying on the spook factor to entertain me while I would otherwise be bored with nothing to do. The spook factor has very much died for me in horror games.
This games design promotes finding faster and more active ways around problems. Is a giant camping your ship? Send someone out to bait it, and once they're far use the teleporter to return them to the ship while you use the opening to get out.
You can just sit and wait for an opening but the time that's ticking away is your punishment for not coming up with an active solution. This is an important aspect to the difficulty which drives me to want to play the game in the first place. Its not just about surviving the encounter long enough to get paid with some process of elimination running in the background. It's about improving the efficiency of your game plan and doing better every run. A single player can make a huge difference on the team, and having a knowledgeable team is like a multiplier on an individual players skill. 

Half the excitement for me comes from the dice roll upon joining a lobby with new players. It could be a funny lobby, a try hard lobby, people experimenting with the game there is so much variety in how this game 'can' play out.

An extra note for players hosting Boss only lobbies. Its early access, the rank doesn't work. It resets and displays wrong. If you're kicking anyone who isn't a boss from your titan run lobbies you're probably kicking some of the more experienced players.

Just watch, next thing they will do is release this game then it's done instead of unfinished or worse there will actually be DLC that adds to the game instead of fixes the pre-me release. This is ridiculous of a game that should be called a AAA 4X game. 

This game is all about the struggle to start a base and get a basic economy going without all the mid-late game parts where you try to dial everything in because you need some astronomical turn in to win. Each time you win a round you will gain campaign resources you can then use to make global unlocks that will help you thru the campaign. 

There is also a lot of flexibility in the difficulty of the game, If you play aggressive you will have punishing de-buffs from glades that you will have to quickly tackle and failing can be punishing but you can also win a round fast if all goes well. Play very conservative and you will feel a steady grip of the global de-buffs you will need to play for and manage until victory is yours.

If you are looking for a focus on planning, aesthetics, lore, and empire building (i.e. 'city building'). This probably isn't going to satisfy those desires.

What this game does is capture the feeling of when you first start a base in an RTS - you are looking at a blank canvas, full of possibilities, ready for discovery. As you explore, the picture begins to change and new logistical problems emerge. How will you obtain x resource? Is it better to focus on obtaining x or y?

Most RTS games will settle into a steady rhythm after the early game - your base is established and you seek to expand which brings you into conflict with other groups / players. For most RTS games, these are the fundamental conflicts which drive the experience. This is where some people really dig their teeth into a game and where others may feel anxious.

What Against the Storm manages to do is perfectly capture that early game experience and extend it for the entire game. On paper this makes it sound more similar to a 'city builder', but more accurate is probably 'RTS base builder with resource management'.

There is a certain kind of player that will absolutely adore this game. If you are the kind of RTS player that is obsessed with build orders and optimising the early game, but less interested in the tactics and strategy of player vs player matches this is the  game for you.

As a bonus, the early access for this game is phenomenal. The devs are very active and regularly consult the community. Everything is very transparent and devs provide frequent updates and communication.

216150,MapleStory,"I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.

The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.
When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.
At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.
But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole. 
You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps. 
You meet friends, lovers, and faggots inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.
Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.
You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.

You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.

After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...
You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...
So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"I bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that ""Soulslike is for me"" even though I could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries.  He's not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to [b]play better, not farm harder[/b], with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I [b]want[/b] to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.

But when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.

That's actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don't mind a linear path, but I don't like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I'm playing Elden Ring, if I can't figure something out, I don't feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I'm [i]always[/i] progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.

What KEPT me, was all the stuff I'd hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I'm a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn't feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say ""Wait you think I'm not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!""  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!

I felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn't flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you'll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It's wonderful!

Now to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they're so small compared to the highs I really don't care.

If you want your hand held, you'll hate this.  If you want to feel like you're discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day, this is for you.",bought game spite one best friend convinced 5th time row soulslike even though could barely bothered play first bos previous entry wrong game seems perfect character customization heavy arpg actually make player work b play better farm harder b mysterious lore gritty aesthetic rogue like punishment yet time time much b want b enamored game find frustrated justify spending time improving default thing forgiving weak walked gate saw land first time jaw hit damn floor immediately identified multiple place wanted explore felt like nothing stopping course first thing investigated reassured many thing could fact stop actually realized needed soulslikes mind linear path like feeling trapped mistake playing elden ring figure something feel like entire experience blocked walk away go check something nearby maybe find spell new armor get fight stopping always progressing even walk away option solved biggest problem getting genre kept stuff hoped get game character vague detail share specific enough cause sense wonder actually feel like part huge world torn apart tremendous war feel important start slowly started say wait think tough took redacted actually felt like world reflecting action worked earn place difficulty rose fun felt way kid played legend zelda first time storytelling enough get interested thing going place flood detail dungeon fun explore know get something clear rule getting end path mostly wonderful clear issue ui pretty unintuitive important thing difficult recognize honestly small compared high really care want hand held hate want feel like discovering new world constantly wondering survive next encounter push little every day

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"I find myself playing this daily.  It relieves a lot of stress and calms me down.  It's very relaxing.  The slower more methodical approach this game requires takes me away from a stressful, fast lane style of life.  I find, no matter how my day has been, that getting on this game tends to bring me back down and mellow me out.

It has a lot of variety.  From sniping geese out of the sky with a .22 Longrifle to stalking Bison through the forest at night with a longbow, it has it all.  If you want to sit in a blind/tree stand and use a caller to lure in prey, you can do that.  Scents, lures, and the ability to put a blind anywhere in the game makes it possible.  If you prefer stalking your prey, following blood, broken vegetation, and footprints, that is also viable.  Prefer long range?  People routinely make 425m shots with various rifles.  Want to get up close? Shotguns, bows, crossbows, and pistols are a viable option.  There is something for every play style.

This game is what you make it.  My wife and I had a blast running around at night chasing a pack of boar with .50 cal black powder rifles.  I've spent a few nights chasing deer down on a 4-wheeler and blasting them with 10 gauge slugs, poacher style.  I've also sat in a blind all day waiting for a particular buck to pass by so that I could introduce him to my 30-30.  I've shot Roosevelt Elk, Red Foxes, Grizzly Bears, Whitetail Deer, and Turkeys.  At the same time, I've been eaten by lions, trampled by water buffalo, stalked and hunted by wolves, mauled by a blackbear, caught in a stampede of wildebeests, and even ran over by a crazy whitetail doe who came out of no where and plowed my ass over.

This game is amazing.  Yes.  It has its bugs and assholes.  Yeah, you have to restart the game when your blood hound (yes, you get a bloodhound in a DLC) glitches out.  Sometimes my gear won't appear in my hand and I have to restart.  I've had a perfect shot get stopped by a blade of grass.  I've lost Need Zones because an asshole murdered every creature in 2 square miles.  It's not perfect by any means.  It can be frustrating at times.  But at the same time, I literally screamed in excitement when I finally killed my first diamond.  I have never had a game make me do that.

It's a great and immersive game.  It's not perfect and it never will be.  And that's okay.  It's still a great game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I'm a 70 yr old lady, and I've played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. 
On the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it's just a thought.

Happy New Year 2020!
Just a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).
And I'm still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...
If you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.
I do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.
I am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.
In the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!
All the best to all gamers in 2020.

I have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... 
To All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha

UPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I'll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.

Thank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel ""Gaming Grandma""  

I have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it's a fabulous game. 

Now I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. 

Have I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. 
A very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. 

I hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold).

692890,Roboquest,"[i](Review written while playing v1.0)[/i]

[b]A strong 9/10 FPS roguelite combining elements of DOOM, Risk of Rain, Borderlands, and a hint of Overwatch.[/b]

As an FPS veteran of almost two decades, i actually don't have much to say about the minute-to-minute gameplay of Roboquest other than the fact it's immaculately designed. This is one of those games where if you're familiar with the genre, everything just instinctively [i]works.[/i] As soon as i was given control in the demo i could immediately tell just the basic movement alone was incredibly well crafted, it's kind of absurd how good of a job they did. I was hooked in less than an hour.

The gunplay is immensely satisfying, the combat demands your full attention at all times, the classes skills and items come together to make varied and fun build combinations every run, the soundtrack by Noisecream is [b]ridiculous[/b] [i](there isn't a single track in the entire OST i didn't like)[/i] and the art direction takes your eyes on a romantic dinner date under the pale moonlight at the most luxurious dining establishment money can afford in Lyon, France, hometown of developers RyseUp Studios.

Basically everything is on point, RyseUp almost doesn't skip a beat. The beats they [b]do[/b] skip don't even warrant anything but minor complaints, which i'll list from most to least important. [b]There WILL be spoilers past this point.[/b]


[h1]CONTENT[/h1]
What's likely the most recurring complaint with players. While the game isn't [i]barren[/i] by any means, it really does stretch that $25 price tag to it's limit. There's roughly 30 hours of game to play give or take about 10 depending on how fast you do it all, and while that's obviously not a [i]short[/i] amount of time, for a Roguelite game like this that's definitely on the shorter side of things in terms of replay value.

And after you've done everything, there's currently no point [b]to[/b] replaying the game other than to beat your best times, beating it on higher difficulties, or just because you feel like it. I will say though, you know you got a masterpiece on your hands when the biggest complaint from players is that [b]they want more game to play.[/b]


[h1]BALANCE[/h1]
The game is overall balanced very well, but there's some slight issues here and there.

Low damage high fire rate weapons like SMGs, ARs, and LMGs could use a buff, i never use them over anything else, most other weapons outclass them in every way in my experience. Some more niche weapons like the mine launcher and dragoon mortar i never use either, the damage they deal isn't worth using over something more conventional. I can't think of much else when it comes to weapons though, they're all good in their own ways.

The game likes to sometimes throw just a few more enemies than you can handle at one time, leading to a perfectly good run coming to a sudden halt when you can't chew through everything the game expects you to handle. The worst example of this being...

The final two battle rooms on the Moon are harder than the fight with IRIS herself, this has been the case with every run i've had that's gotten there, even with power crystals. WAY too many things being thrown at you at once, even with a strong build it's always the hardest part of the moon.


[h1]CHARACTER / STORY INTERACTION[/h1]
After de-corrupting IRIS and watching the end cutscene, nothing really [i]happens[/i] in-game, you're still in the same old basecamp as you were at the start, nothing's been changed or added. It feels odd doing the same gameplay loop over and over when i've already fixed IRIS and Haven 8 is back up and running, y'know? My headcanon is that the Guardians are just really bored afterwards and they keep bugging IRIS to make more badbots for them to fight, much to her annoyance. Having the option to move the camp to Haven 8 after the end would be a cool addition, but i realize this might be more dev work than it's worth.

It's also odd that Max is the only character who properly speaks to you in-game amongst the smattering of other NPCs that exist, i feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities for some fun interactions there. Having these NPCs hang out in your camp after completing their side quests would've been a cool feature as well, as the camp in it's current state is pretty lifeless despite the very lived-in feel.

[h1]----------------------------------------[/h1]

All in all, an absolutely stellar game made by a relatively unknown studio up until this point, or at least i myself have never heard of them. If you like FPS games in any capacity, Roboquest is worth every single penny even with the slightly lacking amount of content it contains at launch. I'm sure RyseUp will stuff it with more content over time with the amount of attention and positive reception the game's getting, so if you feel like the current price tag is a bit much for what you get, just wait until then or wait for a sale.",review written playing v1 0 b strong 9 10 fps roguelite combining element doom risk rain borderland hint overwatch b fps veteran almost two decade actually much say minute minute gameplay roboquest fact immaculately designed one game familiar genre everything instinctively work soon given control demo could immediately tell basic movement alone incredibly well crafted kind absurd good job hooked le hour gunplay immensely satisfying combat demand full attention time class skill item come together make varied fun build combination every run soundtrack noisecream b ridiculous b single track entire ost like art direction take eye romantic dinner date pale moonlight luxurious dining establishment money afford lyon france hometown developer ryseup studio basically everything point ryseup almost skip beat beat b b skip even warrant anything minor complaint list least important b spoiler past point b h1 content h1 likely recurring complaint player game barren mean really stretch 25 price tag limit roughly 30 hour game play give take 10 depending fast obviously short amount time roguelite game like definitely shorter side thing term replay value done everything currently point b b replaying game beat best time beating higher difficulty feel like say though know got masterpiece hand biggest complaint player b want game play b h1 balance h1 game overall balanced well slight issue low damage high fire rate weapon like smgs ar lmgs could use buff never use anything else weapon outclass every way experience niche weapon like mine launcher dragoon mortar never use either damage deal worth using something conventional think much else come weapon though good way game like sometimes throw enemy handle one time leading perfectly good run coming sudden halt chew everything game expects handle worst example final two battle room moon harder fight iris case every run gotten even power crystal way many thing thrown even strong build always hardest part moon h1 character story interaction h1 de corrupting iris watching end cutscene nothing really happens game still old basecamp start nothing changed added feel odd gameplay loop already fixed iris 8 back running know headcanon guardian really bored afterwards keep bugging iris make badbots fight much annoyance option move camp 8 end would cool addition realize might dev work worth also odd max character properly speaks game amongst smattering npc exist feel like lot missed opportunity fun interaction npc hang camp completing side quest would cool feature well camp current state pretty lifeless despite lived feel h1 h1 absolutely stellar game made relatively unknown studio point least never heard like fps game capacity roboquest worth every single penny even slightly lacking amount content contains launch sure ryseup stuff content time amount attention positive reception game getting feel like current price tag bit much get wait wait sale

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"At 666 hours, I feel able to give a reasonable-enough review for folks looking into this game.
Hunt is unforgiving.  The first dozen or so matches (maybe 5-10 hours) will be complete shocks and chaos.  Their tutorial is not great; if anything, it teaches you how NOT to play the game well.  But if you have a friend who's familiar with the game, or if you watch a few streamers/YouTubers, you'll quickly get a feel for this game.
It's fun, edge-of-your-seat, brutally realistic action (as in, one bullet from someone you don't see or hear ends your match).  It's a game about stealth, movement, and strategy.  
The weapons all feel well-balanced.  You can kill just as effectively with your starting guns (if not better) than the final-unlock automatic rifles and semi-modern tech handguns.
Crytex listens to the community, they don't craft cheap DLC to belch out (I've bought most of it) just for the money.  There's arguments that some skins are ""PAY TO WIN"" because they might disappear into the forests better.  I find this is generally untrue for seasoned players, and feel like the devs are working ahrd to keep the community happy and the game thriving.

If you are the type of person who got this far looking into Hunt - I think you're probably the kind of person who would enjoy it.  Give it more than 1-5 games to get used to it.  Remember, you don't win - you just live to die another day.",666 hour feel able give reasonable enough review folk looking game hunt unforgiving first dozen match maybe 5 10 hour complete shock chaos tutorial great anything teach play game well friend familiar game watch streamer youtubers quickly get feel game fun edge seat brutally realistic action one bullet someone see hear end match game stealth movement strategy weapon feel well balanced kill effectively starting gun better final unlock automatic rifle semi modern tech handgun crytex listens community craft cheap dlc belch bought money argument skin pay win might disappear forest better find generally untrue seasoned player feel like devs working ahrd keep community happy game thriving type person got far looking hunt think probably kind person would enjoy give 1 5 game get used remember win live die another day

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have logged 29 hours so far on this game. Sure, probably not impressive. But I'm a dad, married and have a needy dog. Logging that many hours is a big deal to me because that means I successfully snuck that many hours of gameplay in. So, if you're someone like me that loves video games but has to sneak away at night after the spouse falls asleep and the kids are down for the count after 13 bed time stories, keep on reading.

I bought HLL in lieu of Battlefield 2042. I have logged many years of gameplay on the Battlefield series. But, the reviews came out and I was let down. So, I browsed and browsed for a game to play. I have experience on Squad, liked it, but it wasn't fully drawing me in. Was very complex. A fun game (definitely check it out), but there was so much going on I just couldn't commit. Hell Let Loose is very simliar to squad. So, I'mma break this down as best I can.

What I like: 

o 1 shot 1 kill, for the most part. It's hardcore. Literally. Don't worry about pumping rounds into people's bodies. One shot will do.

o Games can last for 1.5 hours, so you get REALLY into it. You have to, just so the game can end.

o It is extremely well balanced. It doesn't matter if you are level 3 and the other team is level 132. You all get the same guns. Snipers get scopes. That's it. None of this ""oh well in WW2 they had a type of red dot site"" garbage that some games do. Nah, fam. That carbine? Iron sites. That STG-44? Iron sites. That LMG? Iron sites, my guy. Which is great, because that means when you die, it wasn't from some garbage or BS. It was a legitimate kill.

o The community is fantastic. I was so lost when I joined my first server. Had no clue what was going on. I hopped into the ""recon"" squad and was the spotter. Told the dude ""Hey man. First time playing this. What do I do?"" You know what his response was? ""Not a problem man! I'll walk you through it."" This dude literally explained how this game worked for me in one match. It was fantastic. When you join regular infantry squads, I have had the same experience. ""Hey, how do I do nodes? How do I mark things?"" The community has been my favorite part. They're all there to have fun, and they hate toxic individuals. Very rarely do I encounter someone who is toxic. And if they're a dee-eye-see-kay, they usually get booted from the game.

o Are you a tank guy? You like driving around in track vehicles shooting big rounds? You can do that and not get destroyed by a squad full of rocket launcher dudes. Nah, each squad gets 1 person to have an anti tank launcher. Which means it takes coordination and team work to take down armored vehicles. Don't worry, to run a tank? You need 3 people. Everyone plays a role in the tank, not just 1 person. You need driver, gunner and tank commander. So, that helps offset the fact that they're giant beasts and gives the guys on the ground a fighting chance.

There's a couple others, but overall, this game is exactly what I was looking for. Big maps, great graphics, SO MUCH CHAOS oh man the audio! It's insane. Artillery blowing up everywhere, machine guns ripping over your head to where your screen goes blurry and you got the spins like it's St. Patty's Day and you're in Boston.

But overall, it's just the balance of the game. No squad can be overpowering and dominating. No vehicle is overpowering. It's all balanced as it should be, because neither succeed unless everyone works together.

So, if you're like me who's a sort-of-casual-player-but-also-wants-to-be-hardcore, get this game. It's a breath of fresh air from Battlefield, the community is great, and it's nice to play a game where everyone is communicating but also, for the most part, treats each other with respect.

       I never write reviews, I don't care I just play games but I feel like I should give this one a review. 
      Pros
      - Indepth research tree, probably fineshed it a hundred times, still find excitiment because you can't memorize what tech will come next because it's largely chance. 
      - Asthetics are great and I forget I'm playing a game, I wake up at 10 Am to play and its midnight before I realize I did'nt do my hw. 
      - Replayable 110%. No two galaxies are the same. 
      - Space battles are cool, ss of space battles probably take up 5 Gb of my computer space. 
      - Ai is interactive and actually does stuff. Although I suspect it cheats. 
      - Lots of traits, lots of content, lots of options, lots of planets, lots of species, lots of ways to play. 
      - events make the game more interesting although I keep getting the same end game crisis which annoys me.  
      - Purge, genocide, slavery, warcrimes
Cons
      - End game lag, fr my biggest problem with the game istg I cant even enjoy playing. I set me resolution to really low and my computer aint even that bad although I suspect its just my 8Gb ram. 
      - Ai probably cheats, even on ensign (normal) difficulty. Although its just an Ai and you can outsmart them. 
      - I HATE PLANET BUILDING SO MUCH DOING IT MANUALLY TAKES A BAJILLION YEARS. Ik there is an autobuild but I suspect its the same thing the Ai uses and knowing the Ai it's going to be retarted. If they added something like a planet template where you make templates and paste them to planets that would be the only update I'd ever need. 
      - They made ringworlds pathetic :( 
      - Endgame lag
      - Lag sucks
      - Lag
      - Lag
      - Minor graphic bugs (dyson sphere showing up half stuck in a star, planets half terraformed show up on the galaxy map in their star system posistions)
      - Lag

       All of these cons are just my opinion, there is really nothing wrong with this game, except lag. But thats just performance the actual game is the best I've ever played. I've never had so much fun playing by myself. 
       So you might be thinking to yourself, why the fuck would I buy this game? Well dear reader if you like purging trillions of aliens then this is the game for you, or you can go a diplomatic pacifist but thats boring asf. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD. 9/10 without lag 4/10 with lag. Would play a thousand more hours but I have to procrasinate for my AP exams. 
      STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME, go away, I need to figure out why I wasted 20 minutes writing a review ppl will just skim over.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"A great single player franchise turned into a live service...

I was hoping to give this game a good review being a big fan of previous games but I cannot. While the campaign is very well done there are too many live service elements getting in the way. Unlike previous games this is an MMO through and through, it doesn't feel right having the ""4"" in the title when it's nothing like the past single player focused games.

Once you complete the main campaign you're thrown into the online live service which can't really be avoided, this game is online only and can't be played offline. The microtransactions are heavily overpriced, a lot of them costing as much as the game itself. The battlepass is a joke, literally giving you rags and wooden weapons for the free version while of course the paid version gets all the shiny gear, it feels like a f2p game that costs $70.

What hurts most of all is the season, instead of doing a proper expansion like past games you only get temporary content every few months and once it's gone it's gone. This is the biggest shame of all considering the season content is rather nice and filled with unique quests and story, but I couldn't bring myself to finish it knowing it will be ripped out of my hands come this January. The entire time I spent playing I just kept feeling awful that I was going to lose everything by the end of the season. I wanted to keep my vampire familiar!

I can't recommend this game, it feels like a huge waste of time with all the content that gets removed. If you saw the Steam page and you thought the current vampire content looked cool you can kiss all that goodbye in just a few months, you won't be able to keep most of it aside from a few transmogs.

I went back to playing Diablo 3 offline on my Switch, it just felt better knowing that will always be there.",great single player franchise turned live service hoping give game good review big fan previous game campaign well done many live service element getting way unlike previous game mmo feel right 4 title nothing like past single player focused game complete main campaign thrown online live service really avoided game online played offline microtransactions heavily overpriced lot costing much game battlepass joke literally giving rag wooden weapon free version course paid version get shiny gear feel like f2p game cost 70 hurt season instead proper expansion like past game get temporary content every month gone gone biggest shame considering season content rather nice filled unique quest story bring finish knowing ripped hand come january entire time spent playing kept feeling awful going lose everything end season wanted keep vampire familiar recommend game feel like huge waste time content get removed saw steam page thought current vampire content looked cool kiss goodbye month able keep aside transmogs went back playing diablo 3 offline switch felt better knowing always

1260320,Party Animals,"No offline mode.

I am seriously tired of games advertised as having singleplayer and local coop not being playable offline because they need to sell their microtransactions. I was excited for this game but now I couldn't care less.

Literally false advertising:

""Fight your friends as puppies, kittens and other fuzzy creatures in PARTY ANIMALS! Paw it out with your friends both online and **offline**. Interact with the world under our realistic physics engine. Did I mention PUPPIES?""

Edit: 

The devs responded by pointing out that the game was only playable online during closed testing. I have participated in many closed and open alpha and beta tests and can say this is standard in the industry for a game that hasn't released. Studios typically make playtest builds require internet connection so that they can control when players can access a free copy of the game, stress test servers, collect playtesting data, and avoid the game being accessible early through piracy which is completely reasonable for an unreleased game that noone has bought. With that, an online requirement for an early play test of a game in no way says that the game wouldn't be playable offline on release. As an example COD typically requires you to be online when playing the beta tests however every COD on console has offline play. I would have been shocked if any decent size game was playable offline during playtesting.

But the devs expected me to ignore the product description that specifically said the game was playable offline and judge whether or not the game was playable offline on a closed play test I had access to? You guys said the game was playable offline in the product description and have the audacity to say ""The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either.""

We wiped on a dungeon because the healer was struggling to keep up, If this would have happened on WoW, there most likely would have been a vote to kick the healer. Instead the tank talked the healer through what he needed to do and offered to make smaller pulls. The dungeon took twice as long as it would have done but the whole experience was much more enjoyable. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to get into an MMO.

1151340,Fallout 76,"This is a great game. But I'm giving it a negative review for one reason:

Not because it was a hot mess on release and it took Bethesda a year and a half to fix it with the Wastelanders update.

Not because Bethesda insisted on only selling it for their own launcher in order to make as much money as possible (the Steam Store takes a cut).

Not because of the Atomic Store, in which you can buy insanely overpriced cosmetics through micro-transactions (in a $40 game, yeah..)

[i]Not even[/i] because the Atomic Store also offers Repair and Scrap kits (i.e. [u]NOT[/u] cosmetics) despite Pete Hines repeatedly promising players that the micro-transactions would be limited to cosmetic items.

But because since release players have been requesting unlimited stash space for junk, and Bethesda have ignored this for more than a year only to offer a monthly subscription allowing you to pay $15 dollars a month [i]for unlimited junk space[/i]. 

Since release the excuse for not giving players unlimited stash space for junk has been that it was not technically possible, that it would crash servers. Fallout 1st proves that that was bullsh*t.

EDIT (~60h): I see a lot of people in the comments misunderstand the review. I'm not asking for unlimited stash space. I'm only asking for unlimited junk storage.

EDIT 2 (~65h): I have subscribed to Fallout 1st. Let's see if this changes my perception of things.

EDIT 3 (~120h): My perception of things has not changed a bit after 50+ hours with Fallout 1st. The scrap box should be free. Maybe even the tent (which serves as an extra camp with a stash and a scrap box, so you always can unload your items if you get overencumbered while exploring). The fact that I could not enjoy the game after 60 hours without Fallout 1st is bad. Really bad.

230410,Warframe,"PROS
+ Movement is something else! It may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls, this is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octane, to the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.
+ You can farm Prime parts to sell for Platinum, the ""premium"" currency, which means that, with some patience, you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.
+ Most items have a ton of customization options ASIDE from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything. Warframes? Recolorable! Weapons? Recolorable! Your own SPACESHIP?! YES! Recolor away! Pets, sadly, are a biiiiit harder to recolor, I think.
+ Very, VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.

CONS
- Very, very grindy. If you just craft a Warframe, it literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.
- You can... actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game. Production value shoots up as you progress, showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... ""samey"", where you're just progressing from node to node, junction to junction, and it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and above, though? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. However, the game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are now, to give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.
- Terrible customer support.
- There is very little info on how to progress past Uranus. So heed my words, when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS!

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"so with Season 4 around the corner and Overwatch PVE basically cancelled, i would like to leave a review of One of the best shooters in decades.

Deep rock galactic is nothing but a masterpiece, a incredible 4 player PvE with incredible lore, Gameplay, customisation  weapons and Dwarves. 

while everything about this game is awesome, i want to mention the best and most unique things about it
.
1. The Community, i think it is a fairly easy argument to that the DRG (short for Deep Rock Galactic) Community is one of the greatest, from our collective goals, to our inside jokes, our camaraderie and the never ending ""Rock and Stone!"", which anywhere you look on the internet you can probably find one dwalf shout that line with the most sincerity imaginable, from Green beards to Grey beards we are all working together and  have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over.

2. is the meta, or lack there of; everything is use-able and viable, all classes equally picked, all weapons having usage, all grenades, another tid-bit about meta is how well all classes can work together, to execute unique plans or to turn the geneva convention in to the geneva checklist.

3. class diversity, while this could fall into the prior category, i feel like it deserves its own point  all classes have strengths and weakness that other classes can make up and also strengthens their strengths, which you would think would be obvious but it can't be stated how incredible it is.

4. Team work, its expected in a PvE but no mater what class, Green Beard to Grey Beards, team work is key to all missions and assignments.

5. ""Battle Pass""; A shunned word these days but i assure you that, in DRG we don't do Payed battle passes here, they are free and offer awesome looking loot and skins, these are all cosmetic and look awesome.

Personally this game is a 9/10 if not 10/10

Pros|
- ROCK AND STONE!
- Great gameplay loop
- Incredible community 
- Awesome class dynamic 
- One of the best PvEs
- Unique cave generation and Bug variety
- Countless loadout combinations
- Able to Tip Floyd the Bartender 

Cons| 
- Management doesn't know anything
- Elven Spies?!?
- A bit repetitive
- Double barrel Overclock not buffed yet
- People who dont Rock and Stone
- Some cheaters

NOTE: Since battle passes are free, that doesn't provide Ghostship Games with much post game financial compensation, so if you do like this game and wish to support the devs, the DLC, it is complete customisation

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"This is an OLD REVIEW that has been updated to the full release version of Hunt: Showdown. Many things have changed, and the review is horribly outdated, so I have done my best to include all of the new updates in the review.


[b] PROS: [/b]


- The atmosphere of the game is amazing. You can really get immersed in the world alone, depsite the lack of NPCs or voice acting.

- Graphics to this game look fantastic, even on low settings.

- Weapons feel good, shoot good, and make you feel powerful with each shot. Also includes bullet speed, and one-shot headshots up to reasonable distances depending on ammo type.

- A leveling system, complete with weapons, perks, abilities, and consumables to unlock and equip, and a near-endless variety to pair and test out together.

- Lots of weapon and character variety. From rifles with bayonets to silenced revolvers. From a noob cowboy with plain pants and a shirt, to legends wearing black dusters covered in skulls, trinkets, and scars.

- Enemy AI variety is good, making you adapt to their fighting styles and how to counter them effectively. Some enemies rush you mindlessly, but others will sit back and try to take you out at a distance. The AI is simple, but effective at their job.

- The sound design. From the crunching of glass under your feet, to crows taking off when people are too close. The way the barn creaks when you take a step. The distant gunshots and being able estimate how far they are by the sound. Everything revolves around sound, and the sound is beautiful.

- Weapon balancing. Every weapon this game is viable. The later weapons may be more powerful, sure, but you have a reduced ammo pool and ammo replenishment compared to earlier weapons, longer reload times, longer pauses in between shots, and a higher price point. You want to be able to keep an enemy suppressed for days? There's a weapon for that. you want to stay calm, and pick them off with a single, well-placed headshot? There's a weapon for that. You want a single-action revolver with a stock and a short range scope? There's a weapon for that... for some reason.
- Random gameplay. Not in the bad way, either. One game you might not hear a peep the entire round, but the next, gunshots are ringing out from every single direction. You never truly know what's going to happen when you drop into the bayou.
- Having an objective. Oh my god, having an objective. It's what separates this game from PUBG and Escape from Tarkov. Having that tangible, ever-present quest in-game, that requires multiple steps to complete most times, makes the game into more than a PvP experience. It's not something that you can be sneaky about most of the time. You have to reveal to EVERYONE where you are to complete your objective.

[b] MEH: [/b]

- The price. This comes down to personal preference, and whether or not you like the amount of content so far. 2 different levels with multiple areas to explore, different times of day, 3 unique bosses, and a metric ton of challenges and weapons to unlock through gameplay.
- The coop. While it is insanely fun, it can be a real pain if you join with a random partner over and over. There is also the choice of playing with group of 3 rather than 2, but can be opted out of if you would just like to play in a duo. This depends on whether or not you have someone to play the game with, and I would highly recommend picking it up if you have a confirmed partner to play with.
- The bosses. The bosses themselves are great, but the variety isn't, with only 3 bosses to go after. This depends on whether you really care about the boss fights, or whether it's the PvP and world that interests you.
- As far as I can tell, you need a beast of a rig to run this thing properly. It doesn't mean that you won't be able to play, but you'll be confined to playing on lower settings. Not a huge loss overall, but some people are all about dem gwaffics and framerates. The game seems to be getting more and more optimised with each update, so it'll hopefully only get better from here.
- The community. I'll go into detail on this later in it's own section, because it's a tough one to cover in a few sentences.


[b] CONS: [/b]


- The loading. Loading screens are long, which is understandable, since the map is massive. The in-game loading of objects and enemies, isn't. Having a hotspot be completely void of life, then spawn in 3 tough AI enemies 30 feet away both ruins the immersion and your planning from time to time.
- The solo play. While you are dropped in without a partner, other people can still join with a partner, putting you at an obvious disadvantage, making solo play quite difficult. You do get a bonus for doing this, but it normally won't apply to you, since you'll end up dead. Not impossible to do, but takes a lot more skill with a meagre offering to balance it out.
- The updates. Every update normally causes some type of havoc, whether it be textures getting broken, rewards not loading properly, or server disconnects. Every update seems to play around with something unintentional, which is probably thanks to the spaghetti code that's held together with masking tape and wrapping paper. Expect a few... weird... occurrences to pop up from time to time.
- The learning curve. If you don't have an experienced teammate to play with, there is a lot of trial-and-error you will be doing, and you will be stomped into the mud. Over and over. I would definitely suggest watching tutorials or videos on youtube on how to actually play, because there are quite a few concepts that aren't explained anywhere in-game. When should you shoot AI? How does poison work exactly? Why did someone throw a lantern at my ""dead"" friend? This isn't Call of Duty. You won't know everything, and it will be the death of you. Shrug it off, grit your teeth, and jump back in for revenge.


[b] COMMUNITY [/b]

This community should [i]*really*[/i] be avoided for the first little while. While they can be helpful, a large amount have found the mentality of ""This game has been ruined by those filthy [i]casual[/i] gamers"" due to new updates from the devs. It hasn't really been ""casualized"", but has been made different from what it once was. Balancing is a fickle thing, and some people would still rather have the game be reverted back to the 0.6 update, or even the 0.1 alpha.

Every single corner of the reddit, steam forums, or elsewhere, are going to be coated in people complaining about how base mechanics and weapons are overpowered, while others claim that they're underpowered. Burning a downed hunter (which slowly removes him from the match unless his teammate revives him in time) is vilified by a lot of people in this game. They cite it as an unfair and stupid tactic, labelling the people who do this ""insta-burners"". Then you have the crowd who oppose this idea, saying ""Is there any reason to not give yourself an obvious advantage over your opponent?"".

There's also a lot of hate surrounding the ""camping"" in this game. This game with have hectic, tense moments, where you run and gun your way through the woods to extraction. But... you'll also have times where the gameplay slows to a crawl, because 2 teams refuse to move. The team inside the house knows that, with their shotguns, they'll be at a disadvantage if they leave their cover to take on the rifle users outside, and the team outside realises the opposite. Therefore, both teams sit on their hands for ~30 minutes without doing anything. This gameplay scenario is looked down upon from every angle, but it's because people want the other group to make a mistake. Both teams are technically making the right decision. you decide on how you want to play, not the community.

221100,DayZ,"I entered a house looking for some food when I heard some footsteps outside. The guy said hey and entered the house, I said hey back, and he hit me with a hammer. This was the beginning of a beautiful tale, the tale of the Shoe Gang.

Running out of the house and up the street as far and as fast as I could, I finally stopped and turned around to see if I was being followed by the crazy hammer man. As I stood there, hungry and demoralised, I heard ""behind you, behind you"", and up came running another player, much friendlier than my previous encounter.

I told him what happened in town, and he charged off, ""Let's get this mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥"".

Armed only with my ten fingers curled in to balls, we ran at the hammer man, who after seeing our number had doubled, decided to take a more diplomatic approach.

He apologised for hitting me with his hammer, and explained he simply wanted my shoes for his friend. Little did he know that I had just found the most pristine pair of shoes in the house where we first met.

They were my shoes now.

Agreeing to put our differences aside, the three of us teamed up in search of the finest shoes for the hammer man’s friend. We searched high and we searched low, but there were no shoes to be found. Finally, we met up with the shoeless man, whose shoes certainly were in a state of disrepair. Unable to tolerate the toes of the bare footed, the four of us left town and made our way across the countryside.

Sometime later, we encountered another survivor. He had a nice hat, but we weren't there for hats. He was clearly uncomfortable, and he was right to be, as the hammer man had been stashing a secret pistol this whole time. We were explaining our need for shoes when the hammer man went for the kill.

Unknown to him, the gun went to the back of the man’s head, hammer man pulled the trigger, and he completely missed the shot. Listening to hammer man’s accent he appeared to be French, which for me, an Englishman, explained his inability to handle a firearm at 3 centimetres.

Hammer man pulled out his primary hammer and bashed the survivor over the head, and the rest of us piled in with our fists, turning the guy in to a battered mess. We were careful not to hit his shoes, but it turned out that he too was wearing worn footwear. However, it was enough, and our friend fitted the loafers over his aching toes.

It was a beautiful moment cut short, when the guy I met after the hammer man announced that his shoes were now unfit for purpose. Our thirst for shoes was not yet satiated, and we moved on in search of the next pair of clogs.

Sadly, my new friend had to go, leaving myself, the hammer man and his friend to fend for ourselves. The Shoe Gang were hungry, and so we holed up in an abandoned house to hide from the rain that had started to fall and munch our way through some beans.

The rain gave way, and we pushed on, the scent of leather driving us through the forests. We took part in some fishing, sat round a fire cooking, and discussed our shoe filled fantasies.

As we moved on and day began to turn in to night, the sound of wolves filled the air. We were outnumbered, and our shoes were worn out. They were upon us in the blink of an eye.

Hammer man was the first to fall, flailing his gavel relentlessly as the beasts took him. I attacked the alpha wolf with a big stick which only seemed to anger him. Soon everything began to fade, the blood loss was traumatic and I slipped in to darkness.

The wolves killed us all, and I have no doubt that they took all of our shoes.",entered house looking food heard footstep outside guy said hey entered house said hey back hit hammer beginning beautiful tale tale shoe gang running house street far fast could finally stopped turned around see followed crazy hammer man stood hungry demoralised heard behind behind came running another player much friendlier previous encounter told happened town charged let get mother armed ten finger curled ball ran hammer man seeing number doubled decided take diplomatic approach apologised hitting hammer explained simply wanted shoe friend little know found pristine pair shoe house first met shoe agreeing put difference aside three u teamed search finest shoe hammer man friend searched high searched low shoe found finally met shoeless man whose shoe certainly state disrepair unable tolerate toe bare footed four u left town made way across countryside sometime later encountered another survivor nice hat hat clearly uncomfortable right hammer man stashing secret pistol whole time explaining need shoe hammer man went kill unknown gun went back man head hammer man pulled trigger completely missed shot listening hammer man accent appeared french englishman explained inability handle firearm 3 centimetre hammer man pulled primary hammer bashed survivor head rest u piled fist turning guy battered mess careful hit shoe turned wearing worn footwear however enough friend fitted loafer aching toe beautiful moment cut short guy met hammer man announced shoe unfit purpose thirst shoe yet satiated moved search next pair clog sadly new friend go leaving hammer man friend fend shoe gang hungry holed abandoned house hide rain started fall munch way bean rain gave way pushed scent leather driving u forest took part fishing sat round fire cooking discussed shoe filled fantasy moved day began turn night sound wolf filled air outnumbered shoe worn upon u blink eye hammer man first fall flailing gavel relentlessly beast took attacked alpha wolf big stick seemed anger soon everything began fade blood loss traumatic slipped darkness wolf killed u doubt took shoe

1062090,Timberborn,"[h1]A City Builder with a Story[/h1]

There is much to love in this already solid early access city builder game! It reminds me of some other city builder titles; like Dawn of Man, Ancient Cities, and Nebuchadnezzar. But it gets right what a lot of other games miss. There is an ease of play to the mechanics that make it seem like a more developed game. The devs thought of a lot of what the gamer would need. It is already perfectly playable in its current state. The story background is an apocalyptic future where the beavers out-survive the humans. There are ruins scattered around the map, presumably from the fallen human civilizations. 

What it does not have is any type of combat. It's a struggle with nature. The only weather element so far is the water cycle: drought and flooding. It looks as if seasons may be more fully developed in future updates. The city building is complex enough to allow the player to use strategy to combat nature... a typical PVE game. It employs hunger and thirst elements, as well as a need for basic resources to build with, like wood and metal scraps. I already get a deeper, more visual feel for the way the water cycle works than anything you can get from just reading books. Good models are like that.

What I  am enjoying immensely is the realistic engineering and landscaping.  It allows so much more gameplay in this area than in games like City Skylines, which I do love. I love the ability to shape the land and use dynamite. I love being able to edit and create my own maps. I am also enjoying the trading elements of being able to trade between districts. The whole district component is a fun part of the game. 

What I look forward to is the addition of more factions and expanded gameplay features that are sure to come. But, most importantly, I would love the addition of a workshop to play maps that other gamers create and share. I think that multiplayer competitive and cooperative could be perfectly do-able in this game in the future. I also could see the addition of scenarios... which I don't care for very much myself in a game. But, some people like that. I certainly look forward to more maps and BIGGER maps. It's all good! 

The music is an enjoyable experience. The artwork is very good. It's a fun game that will provide hours of enjoyment. And, its well worth the money spent, since I already have over 80 hours in the first week and a half since release. I can't quit playing. I highly recommend this game for people who love city builders.",h1 city builder story h1 much love already solid early access city builder game reminds city builder title like dawn man ancient city nebuchadnezzar get right lot game miss ease play mechanic make seem like developed game devs thought lot gamer would need already perfectly playable current state story background apocalyptic future beaver survive human ruin scattered around map presumably fallen human civilization type combat struggle nature weather element far water cycle drought flooding look season may fully developed future update city building complex enough allow player use strategy combat nature typical pve game employ hunger thirst element well need basic resource build like wood metal scrap already get deeper visual feel way water cycle work anything get reading book good model like enjoying immensely realistic engineering landscaping allows much gameplay area game like city skyline love love ability shape land use dynamite love able edit create map also enjoying trading element able trade district whole district component fun part game look forward addition faction expanded gameplay feature sure come importantly would love addition workshop play map gamers create share think multiplayer competitive cooperative could perfectly able game future also could see addition scenario care much game people like certainly look forward map bigger map good music enjoyable experience artwork good fun game provide hour enjoyment well worth money spent since already 80 hour first week half since release quit playing highly recommend game people love city builder

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Please look at my recommended settings at the bottom to enjoy the game a lot more and feel like stardew valley instead of a time management game (hopefully). After playing for around 60 hrs, I can honestly say (rating 4/5)


The Good:
1. Its not to grindy for surviving while at the same time not making it so easy that you get bored within an hour or so
2. You have one life so unlike minecraft or other survival games, you need to make sure you dont just run headlong onto a bear or a pack of wolves
3. Seasonal change introduces different environment (so not the same boring environment looks), need for cold climate clothing etc.
4. Farming and base management needs scheduling and planning to work right during the season change
5. If done right, you will realise that your not self sufficient just like real life. You need to get good at making some things while using other settlements for trading and making your base thrive, otherwise you will always keep expanding your base
6. Combat mechanics are good and straightforward. It feels good to lob spears at bunnies and other animals (or bandits :) )
7. Read a few reviews that made me doubt if the game is fun like the reviews mentioning why npcs cant just get water themself etc. but this really isnt an issue in-game. It just like irl where someone transfers water to your localized supply for you to get and consume. However, its only fun when using my recommended settings


The Bad:
1. Too grindy when running on general sandbox settings. Too many items each weighing a lot and you can carry so little means that you need to run back and forth too much making the game stressful and annoying. Even if your not working a particular profession, you may still need some of its ingredients on you for other stuff on a regular basis. All the grind is because of the extremely small inventory carry capacity making it too back and forth over an already time consuming management game with several aspects in the game

2. Default Season changes every 3 days which is hardly any time to get things done so you rush around. Again, stressful since you have hardly the time to get stuff before the next season sets in making other activities like expansion etc. a chore to do in your spare time

3. Main story is just pure garbage. Dont come into this game for the main story. Also quests are very limited. Would be better if there were more quests to get basic stuff for npc's for cash and rewards (food etc.) alongside dynasty reputation points. I feel like the rewards are inadequate and I need to rely only on selling stuff to make money. You cant be the friendly neighbourhood 'all services' guy since your not paid enough and/or provided for to make a living out of it

4. The tech tree is sooooo looong and makes it boring to achieve. Want a mine to get that iron ore? Wait for ten years of grinding. Really hate when games show their deficiencies by making the game grindy to prolong gameplay. However, if you read my recommended settings below, you may realize this game is a lot more fun than it seems to be due to poor sandbox settings. 


Recommended Settings:
1. Season #days - 4   
Makes every season longer which gives you time to breathe and relax like in stardew valley while at the same time making it slightly difficult in that things like crops etc. need to be farmed in larger fields since harvested, you will need them to last for 4 days per season instead of 3 per season

2. Inventory - Infinite Carryweight 
While this sounds like cheating, unless you never try to build your settlement or are extremely cheesing it, you will build storage structures and store stuff to reduce the clutter in your inventory and provide for your settlers. The eventual mounts you buy will help change the scenery and speed of travel after your thousand years of running across the planet on foot. Trust me, this does not change my gameplay by much but removes the most annoying grinding crap in this game (like not going to ONE mine 4-5 times just to get some good metals for yourself and your base. Lets you focus on other aspects of the game)

3. Tech learning speed - 150%   
Still slow progress but it seems a lot better and just as I start getting annoyed I get the building I wanted (except things like mine or the garbage tavern that you may never get in a thousand years)

4. Villager Demands - 85%-90%   
Otherwise your in a never ending loop to expand to provide. It makes it easier to manage while not being too easy

This really made the difference and while I still run around a lot, I can focus and play it like stardew valley whilst staring at the sky from time to time or spear fishing when I see a perch from time to time.",please look recommended setting bottom enjoy game lot feel like stardew valley instead time management game hopefully playing around 60 hr honestly say rating 4 5 good 1 grindy surviving time making easy get bored within hour 2 one life unlike minecraft survival game need make sure dont run headlong onto bear pack wolf 3 seasonal change introduces different environment boring environment look need cold climate clothing etc 4 farming base management need scheduling planning work right season change 5 done right realise self sufficient like real life need get good making thing using settlement trading making base thrive otherwise always keep expanding base 6 combat mechanic good straightforward feel good lob spear bunny animal bandit 7 read review made doubt game fun like review mentioning npc cant get water themself etc really isnt issue game like irl someone transfer water localized supply get consume however fun using recommended setting bad 1 grindy running general sandbox setting many item weighing lot carry little mean need run back forth much making game stressful annoying even working particular profession may still need ingredient stuff regular basis grind extremely small inventory carry capacity making back forth already time consuming management game several aspect game 2 default season change every 3 day hardly time get thing done rush around stressful since hardly time get stuff next season set making activity like expansion etc chore spare time 3 main story pure garbage dont come game main story also quest limited would better quest get basic stuff npc cash reward food etc alongside dynasty reputation point feel like reward inadequate need rely selling stuff make money cant friendly neighbourhood service guy since paid enough provided make living 4 tech tree sooooo looong make boring achieve want mine get iron ore wait ten year grinding really hate game show deficiency making game grindy prolong gameplay however read recommended setting may realize game lot fun seems due poor sandbox setting recommended setting 1 season day 4 make every season longer give time breathe relax like stardew valley time making slightly difficult thing like crop etc need farmed larger field since harvested need last 4 day per season instead 3 per season 2 inventory infinite carryweight sound like cheating unless never try build settlement extremely cheesing build storage structure store stuff reduce clutter inventory provide settler eventual mount buy help change scenery speed travel thousand year running across planet foot trust change gameplay much remove annoying grinding crap game like going one mine 4 5 time get good metal base let focus aspect game 3 tech learning speed 150 still slow progress seems lot better start getting annoyed get building wanted except thing like mine garbage tavern may never get thousand year 4 villager demand 85 90 otherwise never ending loop expand provide make easier manage easy really made difference still run around lot focus play like stardew valley whilst staring sky time time spear fishing see perch time time

You know your doing something right when other developers like EA/Ubisoft/Blizzard, etc, come out saying, ""Baldur's Gate 3 should not be the new standard"". 
To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLC's.

EDIT:
reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I put some time in this game, yes. It is very attractive, and has a great base concept.  Really, I ended up spending most of my time wandering the map, seeing what I could get in to, and trying to see if I was missing anything beyond basic city building sim that it is. 
The reality is, it is a bland grindfest disguised as a very attractive game with a desired objective. You WANT to be another peasant trying to make it work and survive. You WANT to survive and interact with other villages. You WANT to be in danger from bandits, wildlife, and war. The reality is that you get a sniff of these things and nothing more. 

See person in village. Tell them you have a village. They are like ""aight cool"" and move along. Your wife greets you verbally like anyone else would. Actions are basic. You need to strike a house roughly 80 times with one second animations in order to create it, while only being able to carry around 20-30 of the materials needed for those strikes at a time. 

But at the end - for what? You aren't struggling to survive. Your villagers aren't dynamic in the least. They are empty shells with no engagement.  There is no danger or change in the villages around you to be concerned of. 

Everything is static, lifeless, and only existing as a basic interaction. The desire for this game to be more drags you further and further, but you never reach a point to feel like it has delivered on your expectations. So you end up sitting in the middle of a silent, basic village, wondering if making another house will change things, or if planting another field would be ""fun.""  And it isn't. It is just another basic task that reaps no reward other than visual stimulus.",put time game yes attractive great base concept really ended spending time wandering map seeing could get trying see missing anything beyond basic city building sim reality bland grindfest disguised attractive game desired objective want another peasant trying make work survive want survive interact village want danger bandit wildlife war reality get sniff thing nothing see person village tell village like aight cool move along wife greets verbally like anyone else would action basic need strike house roughly 80 time one second animation order create able carry around 20 30 material needed strike time end struggling survive villager dynamic least empty shell engagement danger change village around concerned everything static lifeless existing basic interaction desire game drag never reach point feel like delivered expectation end sitting middle silent basic village wondering making another house change thing planting another field would fun another basic task reaps reward visual stimulus

1623730,Palworld,"A comprehensive review of everything in game so far.

So this game has been on my list for a while, so even though it was Early Access I just HAD to try it.  Most Early Access games are absolute buggy messes, very incomplete and lacking in content, or get abandoned with no real story.  This game, however, is not one of those.  It has everything you'd expect from a survival craft - base building, biomes, temperature, hunger, tool and armor crafting, and more.  Advancing through schematics and stat changes in a manner similar to Ark, but with the added twist of still needing to learn special schematics via exploration, in-game vendors, and combat. There are also small settlements and wandering peoples to interact and trade with, a bounty system, and even roving Pal and bandit gangs to deal with - sometimes those nuisances can even launch raids on you or your base! While the story is not fully developed, there are definite hours of content to enjoy in it, and countless hours and activities outside it to do so as well.  On the first stretch of the starter island (I haven't even fully explored it yet!) I have already spent almost 8 hours at the time of posting!

On top of that, it also has the monster taming concept of the game.  At face value it resembles that of the traditional Pokémon style capture - battle and weaken, use better capture devices, type matchups, etc to increase capture odds - but with freeform combat - that is, it is not turn based and you, players, your Pals, and even wild Pals can dive in and out of freestyle combat as one may please in any encounter.  There are even dungeons and raid battles in which you can encounter some dangerous Pals and their handlers in special arenas, to which you can queue up with other players or drop in on during! 

However, there are multiple purposes to these Pals, they're not just combat buddies.  For starters, when summoned while roaming you can, if you have the right gear, ride or use special abilities while exploring, including flying.  They can also be assigned to bases to work autonomously, building or crafting whatever you queue up, or directly assigned to specific roles.  Their abilities even play roles in base mechanics, for example a Fire Pal may kindle campfires or furnaces while Water Pals turn waterwheels for mill or Electric Pals charge electrical objects! You can also breed (dis)similar Pals to create eggs and incubate them for offspring that can inherit the abilities of their parents, or become hybrids of them!  If you run low on certain resources, rather than going hunting to eliminate and ""farm"" certain Pals you can literally farm them - throw them in a ranch and they can start to drop some of their loot table!  You can even catch the people NPCs of the game, though doing so can put a boutny on you and they rarely offer special bonuses apart from combat partners and crafting at a base, they do not have special abilities, nor can they be put in a ranch or bred for resources.

As far as its Early Access stability goes, I have encountered one crash bug and one animation bug, the former an issue with sorting duplicate stacks (stack limits are MASSIVE so its not as prevalent an issue) and the latter with getting stuck in the crafting animation (fixable by dodging out of it).  Frames are stable as is the multiplayer latency, or lack thereof.  

All in all, if you're a fan of survival-crafts, open world exploration, base building and management, and/or monster taming then you will absolutely LOVE this game!",comprehensive review everything game far game list even though early access try early access game absolute buggy mess incomplete lacking content get abandoned real story game however one everything expect survival craft base building biome temperature hunger tool armor crafting advancing schematic stat change manner similar ark added twist still needing learn special schematic via exploration game vendor combat also small settlement wandering people interact trade bounty system even roving pal bandit gang deal sometimes nuisance even launch raid base story fully developed definite hour content enjoy countless hour activity outside well first stretch starter island even fully explored yet already spent almost 8 hour time posting top also monster taming concept game face value resembles traditional pokémon style capture battle weaken use better capture device type matchup etc increase capture odds freeform combat turn based player pal even wild pal dive freestyle combat one may please encounter even dungeon raid battle encounter dangerous pal handler special arena queue player drop however multiple purpose pal combat buddy starter summoned roaming right gear ride use special ability exploring including flying also assigned base work autonomously building crafting whatever queue directly assigned specific role ability even play role base mechanic example fire pal may kindle campfire furnace water pal turn waterwheel mill electric pal charge electrical object also breed dis similar pal create egg incubate offspring inherit ability parent become hybrid run low certain resource rather going hunting eliminate farm certain pal literally farm throw ranch start drop loot table even catch people npc game though put boutny rarely offer special bonus apart combat partner crafting base special ability put ranch bred resource far early access stability go encountered one crash bug one animation bug former issue sorting duplicate stack stack limit massive prevalent issue latter getting stuck crafting animation fixable dodging frame stable multiplayer latency lack thereof fan survival craft open world exploration base building management monster taming absolutely love game

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","A game that will shine in time. They nailed the setting and lore so well it hurts to say that the actual gameplay isnt done cooking yet. I've had Allied Ai shoot me in the back so many times that it's not a bug its a feature at this point, a few wtf encounters where the game will just break and turns will take ages for the enemy to finish a turn, a very strange difficulty curve where i either demolish the enemy or get wrecked just cause they got lucky? (Getting full Auto'd while behind full cover and the enemy has 35-40 Ballistic skill 4 times in a fight) We also have in game cutscene's not behaving the camera sometimes stay's put even tho the characters move on or they will just stand around like they forgot what they are suppose to do. Space combat also feels tacked on and hard to judge if your in way over your head and I'm not sure how I feel about the Trade System in the game since you don't really have money its based off your characters reputation. As in this guy wont give you things unless you give him a lot of stuff (Make them like you) and prove that you are a big player in the galactic share market. It's odd but may need some more getting use to. 

However the game has nailed things that most 40K games don't. The characters are interesting and give insight into things not often shown in 40k media, they also have alot of flesh and depth to them something 40k struggles with in games. The World and the dialogue are spot on and the choices you make are in context of being in 40k. This is a grim world that often punishes mercy and makes you interact with the choice rather then just I wanna be good or bad. Sometimes being an Emperor nut is totally the moral thing to do. While showing mercy to a civilian can result in the death of many more innocents or worse. 

TLDR wait at the moment. The preorders/collectors can take the brunt of the unpolished gameplay and knowing owlcat they will clean the game up in time. Good time to check back up would probably be after the first DLC drops.

Edit/Update The fact owl cat is paying attention and is actually looking into these reviews says a lot.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.

The game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!

First let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! 

If you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo's don't do this. Other mmo's don't have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say ""well i can't pick up everything like i can in Skyrim"" No you can't, but what mmo let's you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. 

The combat: You don't just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can't get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don't feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. 

The community: It's amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.

The crafting: It's just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn't a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.

The world: The game looks great, it's not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn't going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it's no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. 

The customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i've been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. 

The crown store: It isn't pay to win! It's very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don't pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. 

I haven't experienced PvP yet and i haven't got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!

In closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i'm sure it's going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P! 

Thank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful.

236390,War Thunder,"Gaijin either still don't get it, or more likely just don't care and will say anything. I've played this game a ton, and it gets less and less consumer friendly with every update. New features don't just not improve the game, they actually degrade your experience for the sake of a quick cash grab. The grind gets slower and slower. Bugs and bad features go unaddressed for years, while Gaijin add drones, pointless entrenching tools, and now redundant slowed bombs (there is already a timed fuse if you want). Despite tons of feedback expressing the communities hatred of stats based balance and rewards, the devs pretend not to hear. 

We all know the game needs to make money. But rather than make money by making the game good, Gaijin seems determined to make it painful instead. I would prefer a subscription based model over a F2P. But THIS particular F2P model is just terrible, and getting worse. I can't recommend, despite my many many hours in it. I've gradually stopped buying premiums, stopped paying for premium time, stopped getting the battle pass etc. because Gaijin seems to hate the players.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.",look see much played game know like good game great free trial play want get feel probably heard word mouth going try sell know really good going try let know thing buy see lot people telling new player first maybe important buy game steam buy steam version expansion mean buy ffxiv square enix directly buy future expansion mean steam sale expansion participate go steam buy game steam buy future expansion steam square frustrating seen people buy game wrong place waste money double check bought game first going account mogstation seeing version game second two type subscription entry standard subscription different mean two type subscription first entry subscription 12 99 usd 30 day long get one character per sever total 8 character say go first month subscribing still like game move standard subscription second standard subscription starting 14 99 usd one 8 charcters per sever total 40 overall standard subscription also option purchase multiple month time save money long run especially really game also little addition get like extra retainer little fee month completely optional form inventory management third used wow play every class every job one character mean every character create swap class changing weapon meaning play anything want want new class come level class requires create whole new character big draw swapping character time real pain yes still grinding involved level class well always start square one anyone used play wow reading name change race change also way cheaper remember wow name change 10 usd fantasia way completely makeover character changing race gender nearly everything else save name also 10 usd also bought pack 3 5 save money overall good game thing top head help people new game reading hope fun least trying

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I have played this game off and on since release, I would guess 700 total hours or more.  This game has had numerous updates over the years, but I will tailor this review to newer players.  

First, this game in very welcome to newer players, but I would suggest ignoring the general chat on starter worlds.   

Second, this game is fair to play.  Whether you sub or not, most of the pay options are cosmetic only.  If you subscribe for a single month, once you revert to free to play, you will be a preferred and keep a lot of the benefits.    

Third,  Being a subscriber is my preferred way to play.  You can level using only the class story and never have to grind sidequests to stay within level requirements, most of the time you will end up being downleveled to the content as you will be over the max level for the region.  The class stories are all fantastic, and if you don't have to grind to keep up, you will feel like you have 8 full KOTOR quality games.  

The PVE Experience is great, to include raids (Operations) and dungeons (Flashpoints) with an easy to use groupfinder and difficulty that allows all ranges of capable and experiences of players.  

PVP is good, multiple ways to get involved in PVP to include matches of Huttball, Spaceship combat, world PVP and ranked matches.  The ranked stuff can get cutthroat and is best experienced with a group of players you know.  

My very first recommendations for new players.  1.  Get a security key (free 100 cartel coins monthly, used mostly for cosmetic purchases).  2.  Sub for at least a month.  3.  Get into a guild (most have already unlocked the 10% experience boost).  I highly recommend my own guild of course, Imperial Army on Starforge Server, best group of players I have ever played with accross all my many years of many games www.imperialarmy.org.   and 4.  Experience all the classes to at least level 20 before choosing your main (eventually you are going to want to experience all the class stories, and being subscriber will allow you to do that without breaking up the continuity of lore too much).",played game since release would guess 700 total hour game numerous update year tailor review newer player first game welcome newer player would suggest ignoring general chat starter world second game fair play whether sub pay option cosmetic subscribe single month revert free play preferred keep lot benefit third subscriber preferred way play level using class story never grind sidequests stay within level requirement time end downleveled content max level region class story fantastic grind keep feel like 8 full kotor quality game pve experience great include raid operation dungeon flashpoint easy use groupfinder difficulty allows range capable experience player pvp good multiple way get involved pvp include match huttball spaceship combat world pvp ranked match ranked stuff get cutthroat best experienced group player know first recommendation new player 1 get security key free 100 cartel coin monthly used mostly cosmetic purchase 2 sub least month 3 get guild already unlocked 10 experience boost highly recommend guild course imperial army starforge server best group player ever played accross many year many game www imperialarmy org 4 experience class least level 20 choosing main eventually going want experience class story subscriber allow without breaking continuity lore much
1086940,Baldur's Gate 3,"After ~210 hours and almost three months, I've finally completed the game (I'm a completionist and a slow player who likes to absorb the world carefully and slowly, explore everything, read everything a couple of times, etc).

The sheer level of complexity of interconnected stories, dialogues, outcomes, various characters, and factions is simply unbelievable. Hats off to Larian for managing to create such a rich, complex and meaningful world with hundreds of characters, dozens of factions and interesting groups, vast maps with an abundance of interesting locations to explore and secrets to uncover... While being almost completely nonlinear and giving players the opportunity to do everything in the way they want to do it.

Pros:

- Character models and animations (especially facial animations) are some of the best I've ever seen. It adds so much to the immersion. No matter how important or unimportant an NPC is.

- Superb voice acting, done with so much love, passion and care. And most importantly, with an understanding of the characters they give voices to.

- Generally, the writing is great. It successfully balances Larian's signature humour and silliness with a more macabre and serious tone of the world and the game's story.

- A diverse cast of memorable companions with their own agendas, personalities, personal stories and major questlines. I will miss every single one of them.

- Combat is mostly fun and rewarding. It rewards a tactical approach, experimenting and thinking out of the box.

- Every encounter is a meaningful experience, every combat is hand-crafted, every questline a story on its own, and every location is a unique place. There are no fillers or padding.

- Dozens upon dozens of interesting side stories and quests of various scales and importance.

- Great level design with attention to detail. It’s a pure joy to explore various locations and just look around.
 
- Memorable and multilayered villains with distinctive personalities and agendas.

- Amazing music by Borislav Slavov. Kirill Pokrovsky would be proud.

- Excellent implementation of D&D rules into a video game.

Cons:

- The game's tempo varies. In the early game, it seems that some relationships with companions are developing extremely fast. On the other hand, in Act 3, there is a dichotomy between the urgency of the main quest and the amount of quests, side stories and general stuff you can do and explore in the city of Baludr's Gate.

- Bugs and some general unpolishness become much more obvious in Act 3. Luckily, Larian is actively working on ironing out everything and making the experience truly complete.

- There are some balance issues when it comes to combat, gear, and classes. But that’s also something that will be fixed over time.

- Inventory and companion managing is absolutely horrendous, by far the weakest spot of the game. It’s a nightmare when you try to juggle between characters, find and store items, etc. Recommend using modes for this.

- I personally don't like that almost every companion is player-sexual. It kinda kills their uniqueness and takes away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you.

- The game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all books and notes that you find, info about characters you’ve met, info about the types of enemies you have encountered, etc.",210 hour almost three month finally completed game completionist slow player like absorb world carefully slowly explore everything read everything couple time etc sheer level complexity interconnected story dialogue outcome various character faction simply unbelievable hat larian managing create rich complex meaningful world hundred character dozen faction interesting group vast map abundance interesting location explore secret uncover almost completely nonlinear giving player opportunity everything way want pro character model animation especially facial animation best ever seen add much immersion matter important unimportant npc superb voice acting done much love passion care importantly understanding character give voice generally writing great successfully balance larian signature humour silliness macabre serious tone world game story diverse cast memorable companion agenda personality personal story major questlines miss every single one combat mostly fun rewarding reward tactical approach experimenting thinking box every encounter meaningful experience every combat hand crafted every questline story every location unique place filler padding dozen upon dozen interesting side story quest various scale importance great level design attention detail pure joy explore various location look around memorable multilayered villain distinctive personality agenda amazing music borislav slavov kirill pokrovsky would proud excellent implementation rule video game con game tempo varies early game seems relationship companion developing extremely fast hand act 3 dichotomy urgency main quest amount quest side story general stuff explore city baludr gate bug general unpolishness become much obvious act 3 luckily larian actively working ironing everything making experience truly complete balance issue come combat gear class also something fixed time inventory companion managing absolutely horrendous far weakest spot game nightmare try juggle character find store item etc recommend using mode personally like almost every companion player sexual kinda kill uniqueness take away immersion fall love game kind codex store book note find info character met info type enemy encountered etc

2. They have completely ruined the modding community for this title be REQUIRING the use of CurseForge as a mod platform. Curseforge clearly can dictate what you can and cannot post as a mod, and since it's the only way to publish mods for this game it will fail, hard. 

3. There is nothing in this game that makes it any better than Ark Survival Evolved higher resolution textures.

4. Wildcard has made an exclusivity arrangement with Nitrado that will restrict your ability to setup a server with another company, which has monopolized this service. Nitrado has promptly taken advantage of this by raising their price triple the normal price unnecessarily.

960090,Bloons TD 6,"[h1]This is a game that completely changes based on how you play it and how long you've played it for.[/h1]

[h2]At the 0 hour mark,[/h2] BTD6 is a cute monkey tower defense game that seems fairly straight forward. You just place down monkeys, and these colored balloons called ""bloons"" come that your little monkeys pop with darts. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, because he's all you have.

[h2]At the 25 hour mark,[/h2] you might have had a couple of people tell you what's ""good"" or ""OP"" in the game, then you start using these towers and upgrades for all your games. However, you still have no real understanding of what's going on in the game whatsoever, fumbling around in the dark and dying randomly to rounds all of a sudden when you thought you were doing great. Your favorite Hero is Striker Jones, and certainly not for the right reasons.

[h2]At the 50 hour mark,[/h2] you seem to find more towers and upgrades that [i]seem[/i] to work or [i]seem[/i] good. You might even start to catch on to the common ""problem"" rounds like 63, or start to think that you know a thing or two about the game. This is however, a fleeting illusion. And I assure you that you know nothing. Your favorite Hero is Obyn, because RISE!

[h2]At the 100 hour mark,[/h2] you've won many games on many maps and difficulties. You may have even won your first C.H.I.M.P.S. game by following a guide. You start to think you're good at the game. What short-sighted vision! 90% of the game can still completely crush you at this point. You may even be tempted into purchasing completely pointless micro-transactions now that you're already hooked. Rest assured that doing so is completely pointless and will not make you any better at the game. There are a few rather brutal (you think) game modes *cough* Half Cash *cough* Apopcalyse *cough* which for the life of you, just can't beat. Your favorite Hero is DJ Benjamin, because let's face it, we were all there someday.

[h2]At the 250 hour mark,[/h2] you've really started raking in the Monkey Money just by finishing maps and playing the game. You've already bought all the heroes and their skins. At this point, you start becoming increasingly greedy for game completion, you want those fancy looking ""Black Borders"" everyone is talking about. Unfortunately, you just haven't put enough time into the game at this point to have the knowledge or skill to beat all the game modes legitimately, and so you spam Cash Drops for hard game modes like Half Cash, and beat C.H.I.M.P.S. by watching guides. You fool yourself into thinking that you're a superior Bloons player, when you are in reality just a chimp. Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you think she's good when she's not.

[h2]At the 500 hour mark,[/h2] for the first time you truly start to wonder: what the **** is actually going on in this game? I've watched monkeys pop ""bloons"" for 500 hours, but in truth, I understand nothing. Your thirst for understanding game mechanics deepens and your search for the truth begins. You join Discord servers seeking for knowledge from superior Bloons players (who just troll you, reply in esoteric memes, and say things like ""vrej""), spending hours reading long complicated Reddit posts and crawling through Google spreadsheets. Finally, you learn some proper terminology like ""damage"" and ""pierce"". Where was all this information in the game? You ask yourself. The striking revelation hits you like roaring thunder: It's simply not there! Nothing in the game tells you anything! ""tHiS iS A bIg pLaNe"", really? You even start reading those long detailed patch notes from every update. Your favorite Hero is Pat Fusty, because he's actually good.

[h2]After playing the game for 1000 hours,[/h2] for the first time, you actually feel like you understand the game just a little bit. And rest assured, if you've put that many hours into the game, you probably do understand it just a little. At this point, you can finally beat every game mode in the game legitimately. You may have even completed the easier Expert maps on C.H.I.M.P.S. You've found your way. No longer do you rely on any of the intentionally badly designed game ""features"" characteristic of mobile games. Cash Drops, Powers, and Instas become completely useless and pointless. The last time you've pulled out a Cash Drop was more than 500 hours of playtime ago. They're probably all piling up in the back closet like a mass of adult toys. Now all you want is to beat those hardest maps in the game. What they didn't tell you is that simply beating them all is not the end. Your favorite Hero is Quincy, the starter Hero, because he can beat every map on every game mode.

[h2]At the 1500 hour mark,[/h2] your priorities shift again. Your only goal is to become even better at the game. You realize completion is pointless and the only real growth is in experience and skill. You challenge yourself with the hardest game modes on the hardest maps in the game. But even that isn't enough, so you move into Challenge Editor to create and beat even harder game modes that don't even exist in the main game. C.H.I.M.P.S.? Why not try C.H.I.M.P.S. with only 2 Towers, or only 4th Tier towers, or only 1 DPS tower, or A.B.R. C.H.I.M.P.S., or C.H.I.M.P.S. with Triple HP MOABs. The possibilities are truly endless. Original theorycrafting also starts to come online at this playtime. You tap into secret knowledge known only to the most elite high-level Bloons players and think of completely new ways of understanding different parts of the game. Mastered Mortar micro? Try Ace micro. Haven't heard of RNG-manip in Bloons? Maybe you'll be the first to discover it. You start to question your favorite Hero, because even he can't beat some of these tough challenges.

[h2]At the 3000 hour mark,[/h2] you break through into the league of God tier Bloons players. Anything even in the main game becomes completely trivial. Name any 3 towers, and you will beat almost any map on any game mode with them first try. You turn off Monkey Knowledge because it makes the game even easier than it already is. You play every game with C.H.I.M.P.S. rules, and not even intentionally. If it was possible, you would Half your Cash for all games just for kicks. #Ouch becomes Couch and Puddles becomes Cuddles. Custom Challenges become trivial too. 2TC is a joke. Try Half Cash C.H.I.M.P.S. on Rake. [spoiler]For reasons even you can't understand, you have half a million Monkey Money and 12 Insta Black Borders.[/spoiler] Your favorite Hero is Adora, because you did 2MPC on X Factor with her.

The next challenge... is Reverse Half Cash A.B.R. Triple HP MOABs Double HP Ceramics Quadruple Bloon Speed C.H.I.M.P.S. on Bloody Puddles.

[h2]At the 4000 hour mark,[/h2] you return to the depths of filthy and paltry casual gameplay. You've played this monkey game for so many hours that all the endless chasing of top 3 medals and pushing of the skill ceiling has become... meaningless. You've already done it all and yet you've accomplished... nothing. What is there left to do other than make meme custom maps, impossible challenges and play C.H.I.M.P.S. on ""Your Mom but at a different angle""? Or as DJ Benjamin says, ""Turn up the Double Cash!""

[i]Psi...[/i] is this really the end?

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"Hellblade is a third person action game where the player controls a Celtic woman called Senua, who is fighting through Hell to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the Norse gods.

The melee combat system is really enjoyable. You’re armed with a sword, and you’ve got four basic moves – quick attack, strong attack, dodge and parry. You can also charge up a focus mode, where time slows down but you still attack at normal speed. There are a few different enemies to fight including one armed with a sword, one with a mace, another with a mace and shield, one who dual wields small axes, and a big dude with a massive two handed axe. And of course there are a few unique bosses.

The key to success is to watch your opponent’s movements to anticipate their attacks (there are no flashing icons above their heads here), dodge or parry, and then follow up with your own attacks while their guard is down. The quality of the character animations allows you to really feel the weight behind every hit, especially when Senua gets knocked down, and when she blocks an attack, causing the enemy to stumble backwards.

Hellblade has a kind of permadeath mechanic in place. You’ve got an unspecified amount of lives, and each time you die, a dark black “rot” grows up Senua’s right arm. If it reaches her brain, she dies permanently and your save will be deleted. This adds an intensity to the combat, and makes you want to play cautiously instead of just rushing in and button mashing. However, its not something that you need to be scared of, or a reason to avoid playing the game. I beat Hellblade in one playthrough, and I’d guess I died around ten times. Even the later fights, where you’ll be up against multiple enemies (at one point I was simultaneously fighting eight enemies on a narrow bridge), aren’t too hard if you make intelligent use of focus.

The other primary gameplay mechanic is puzzle solving, but the quality of these is a bit of a mixed bag. The most common type of puzzle requires you to find “runes” to unlock doors. These runes are hidden somewhere in the environment. For example, a letter N might be formed by two tree trunks and a tree branch. You need to stand in the correct spot and then focus your vision on the shape of the rune. Its not a particularly interesting mechanic, and the game solves 90% of the puzzle for you anyway, because you’ll see a bunch of red runes floating in the general area where you need to stand.

The better kind of puzzles involves interacting with objects to change the layout of the environment. For example, your path might be blocked by the illusion of a wall, until you look through an archway which dispels the illusion. In another area, you’ll look through masks to switch back and forth between day and night, to bypass obstacles that are blocking your path.

Throughout the game, you’ll frequently hear several whispered voices, which seem to be a representation of Senua’s internal hopes, doubts and fears. These voices are sometimes helpful or supportive, but mostly they taunt you and try to make you doubt yourself. During combat, when an enemy gets behind you they’ll warn you to “watch out”, but when you take damage they’ll say “she’s going to die”. As you’re wandering around the environment, they’ll claim “she’s going the wrong way, she’s lost”. These voices sound really cool and I can’t remember this being done by any other game that I’ve played.

Senua’s facial expressions might be the best I’ve ever seen in a game. I felt like I could understand her emotional state, especially pain, fear and sadness, just by looking at her face. The way her eyes move makes her seem alive, especially when she looks directly at the camera, and lip syncing is a perfect match to the dialogue. If every game was like this, we could forget about the uncanny valley. Senua’s voice actress, Melina Juergens, also gives a phenomenal performance.

The environments are absolutely gorgeous. Generally I don’t really care about graphical quality, I’m more focused on gameplay and story. But there were times when even I had to stop for a moment and say “wow”. Occasionally you’ll be outside in bright sunlight, looking at a colourful field of flowers. But mostly you’ll be surrounded by ruined buildings full of burnt corpses, or in dark caves, the floor covered in bones, with only a small torch to light the way ahead.

However, I think the area layouts could be better. Many modern games design levels in a kind of circle. When you reach the end of a section, they’ll find an elegant way to quickly get you back to the start, for example through a previously locked door, or by dropping down from a higher platform. In Hellblade, particularly after defeating a boss, you just have to spend about 5 minutes backtracking through the areas you’ve just cleared, with absolutely nothing happening. There’s not much space to explore, and the only reason to do this anyway is to find stone markers that tell you small pieces of stories which are not at all related to Senua, and mostly fall into the category of “a long time ago, this guy you’ve never met and don’t care about did a thing to this other guy you’ve never met and don’t care about”.

I easily maintained a constant 60 fps with all settings maxed at 1080p, and I didn’t suffer from any bugs or crashes. However, you can’t fully rebind controls on a keyboard. In particular, you can’t rebind movement to arrow keys, which is my preferred setup. Instead, I played with my 360 gamepad which worked great.

Overall, while I’m not quite as in love with this game as most of the critics, I did find alot to enjoy, so I’d recommend Hellblade to any fan of action games. As it only took me 8.5 hours to complete the game, I’d suggest waiting for a sale of around 25-33%.",hellblade third person action game player control celtic woman called senua fighting hell rescue soul dead lover norse god melee combat system really enjoyable armed sword got four basic move quick attack strong attack dodge parry also charge focus mode time slows still attack normal speed different enemy fight including one armed sword one mace another mace shield one dual wields small ax big dude massive two handed axe course unique boss key success watch opponent movement anticipate attack flashing icon head dodge parry follow attack guard quality character animation allows really feel weight behind every hit especially senua get knocked block attack causing enemy stumble backwards hellblade kind permadeath mechanic place got unspecified amount life time die dark black rot grows senua right arm reach brain dy permanently save deleted add intensity combat make want play cautiously instead rushing button mashing however something need scared reason avoid playing game beat hellblade one playthrough guess died around ten time even later fight multiple enemy one point simultaneously fighting eight enemy narrow bridge hard make intelligent use focus primary gameplay mechanic puzzle solving quality bit mixed bag common type puzzle requires find rune unlock door rune hidden somewhere environment example letter n might formed two tree trunk tree branch need stand correct spot focus vision shape rune particularly interesting mechanic game solves 90 puzzle anyway see bunch red rune floating general area need stand better kind puzzle involves interacting object change layout environment example path might blocked illusion wall look archway dispels illusion another area look mask switch back forth day night bypass obstacle blocking path throughout game frequently hear several whispered voice seem representation senua internal hope doubt fear voice sometimes helpful supportive mostly taunt try make doubt combat enemy get behind warn watch take damage say going die wandering around environment claim going wrong way lost voice sound really cool remember done game played senua facial expression might best ever seen game felt like could understand emotional state especially pain fear sadness looking face way eye move make seem alive especially look directly camera lip syncing perfect match dialogue every game like could forget uncanny valley senua voice actress melina juergens also give phenomenal performance environment absolutely gorgeous generally really care graphical quality focused gameplay story time even stop moment say wow occasionally outside bright sunlight looking colourful field flower mostly surrounded ruined building full burnt corps dark cave floor covered bone small torch light way ahead however think area layout could better many modern game design level kind circle reach end section find elegant way quickly get back start example previously locked door dropping higher platform hellblade particularly defeating bos spend 5 minute backtracking area cleared absolutely nothing happening much space explore reason anyway find stone marker tell small piece story related senua mostly fall category long time ago guy never met care thing guy never met care easily maintained constant 60 fps setting maxed 1080p suffer bug crash however fully rebind control keyboard particular rebind movement arrow key preferred setup instead played 360 gamepad worked great overall quite love game critic find alot enjoy recommend hellblade fan action game took 8 5 hour complete game suggest waiting sale around 25 33

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"REVIEW UPDATE:
I am now at 85 hours. After learning the mechanics of how the simulations work, I will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics. For instance, the constant low density residential demand.

Aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken, such as trade and garbage bugs, after 85 hours the biggest issues I have with this game are two-fold:
1. An extreme lack of content. Building (and farm) diversity is extremely lacking. I suspect content will be DLC'ed to hell, which I strongly oppose Paradox's DLC strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later.

2. Design decisions that just simply don't work, or don't make sense. For instance, pegging ""wealth"" to ""education level"". Wealth should be pegged to career instead. How off map city services function also doesn't really work. They work against the principle of building a healthy, functioning city. If you lack a service, it doesn't negatively impact your game, except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service. But that's easily countered by cheaper taxes. Standard genre features like the RCI meter work differently to all previous city builders. Instead of showing what to build for a healthy city, CS2 RCI meter shows what the city wants (which most likely doesn't result in a healthy city). Design changes away from genre standards are fine, just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard.

Anyways, after 85 hours my final conclusion stands. I cannot recommend Cities Skylines 2. Aside from performance and bugs, the game has very little content, and has design decisions that don't work, or don't make sense.

----
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I tried to like CS2, I really did. I can ignore the performance issues and bugs, as these are things I see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation. However, there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of. The numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them, that I believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all.

This game is marketed as ""the most realistic city builder ever"", with multiple levels of simulation in the city, sims, economy, services, and traffic. Unfortunately, there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation.

After 20+ hours playing, aside from the known performance problems (which I've mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than I should be), these are the biggest issues I see:

- The economy is broken. Goods in your city aren't actually traded. Import/export don't actually do anything, so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations, ports, and airports, but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map. Industry, commercial and residential don't use your produced goods. There is no cargo traffic in your city, because there is no simulation of producing goods, transporting them to your shops, and then sims buying those goods. It's all completely fake. Colossal Order have confirmed this on Paradox forums.

- The progression system is broken, just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it, repeat over and over. Level 20 without doing anything. Progression is not linked to population, just ""XP"" gained from placing stuff. Thing is, it doesn't remove the XP if you bulldoze straight away. As a result you can have a ""Flourishing Metropolis"" with 50 people. Each main step should have a population limit. IE: town 10k, city 50k, metropolis 100k or something.

- Most people don't actually go to work, kids don't go to school, people don't shop. You can track individual sims. When you follow them, they actually don't go to work. They will get in their cars, or walk to the tram or whatever, jump on, and then do a circuit back home. Or they'll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home. Kids do not leave the house. They will stay in their homes, not going to school. The whole rush hour thing is a joke. Basically, the sims simulation is..... fake. And this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on. A simulation of each individual sim, going about their world, doing what the do. Living, growing, prospering, dieing. All faked.

- The city only ever demands low density housing, never anything else. City of 50k, with very little office demand. Always, low density residential will be 100% demand. You can even buy 20 tiles, do a massive grid of low density residential, it'll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100%.

- You don't need to build any city services, it all comes in really cheaply from off map. It's cheaper to import all services, than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance. The only exception seems to be power and water. You can export power and water for enormous profits.

- Maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all. For some buildings it's cheaper per unit to build a new one, and some are cheaper to just expand. For instance water pump: $10,000 to build 100,000 unit pump, and $7,000 to expand one an extra 50,000 units. Cheaper to make a new one there.

- The traffic AI is just absolutely stupid and retarded. I couldn't think the traffic AI could be worse than CS1, but they actually managed to do it. Cars will do u-turns in the middle of a highway. Cars will stop in the middle of the road, jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam, just to reach a left-hand turn they go straight through instead. Opposing carriage turns (ie: right from left side drive, left from right side drive) will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear. They will turn like it's the middle of Delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam.

- The economy is extremely frustrating. There are no small-town service buildings, so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have. This results in grinding your city's economy into the ground. The only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services. All the while the annoying bird, building icons, and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands. On the flip side, electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance, that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps, and exporting every single piece of it, will have you swimming in money.

- The whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at it's foundations. When you utilise off map services, the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand. You can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can, and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each MWh. Same with importing off map services. Using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out.

- The garbage system is totally cactus. Your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn, rather than burning your own. Your landfill fills up, your buildings fill up, and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish. The only way to get around this is to build huge landfills, and once they are full just bulldoze it. Poof, all garbage gone. Since incinerators don't collect your garbage from landfills, as it's cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there, it's the only way to process landfill.

TL:DR - Optimisation issues aside, there are MAJOR flaws in each of the game's simulations. The entire game presents a facade, layered on top of fancy marketing speak. I think in reality, this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the top-tier city builders in the 30+ years I've been playing city builders.

Update: After a year we finally get XP for performance (win/lose, end-of-match placement, etc)

Personally, I would have thought it better if we also got XP for kills, for example 10XP for a normal kill and 10+5XP for a precision kill. Especially since the weekly challenges have become significantly fewer and we get less XP for them. 
Unfortunately, you have to wait a relatively long time for the game to find a match, the average waiting time can often be 2-5 minutes, this is a huge deterioration compared to the previous ~10 seconds, although this is understandable in terms of the number of simultaneous players. I think the winter update of the game brought some very good changes and additions, but I feel like it did it too late. If it were possible to give a neutral rating, I would change it.

Not subbing will slow progress a good bit but as a new player it might be of benefit. You will be able to experience every single quest and story in the game without overleveling. The biggest annoyance of ftp is the credit limit and group content restrictions. In all honesty you can live without subbing as a new player until you get to around level 60, then it is of benefit to sub for a single month. But without subscription as long as you complete the main class quest and the planetary quest line you will easily be on track for leveling. Also make sure to use your legacy bank for any money that you acquire while unsubbed as that is the only way you can transfer money to other characters on your account. The legacy bank is uncapped also. Subbing will also let you use artifact gear which is super important to the progression in the endgame. I would suggest subscribing then picking that up with the cartel coins you are granted so you can enjoy the endgame better.

Another note about the game that I want people to keep in mind is that this game is one of the worst for regular content updates.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).

Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.

Cons:
- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit
- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.
- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?

One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.

In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.

People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.

If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!
- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.
- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself
- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.
- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards
- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.

There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more.

1245620,ELDEN RING,"This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.

[h1][u]The World[/u][/h1]
I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.

If I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. 

Creature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.

[h1][u]The Gameplay[/u][/h1]
My first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!

I also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage I'd felt when dying repeatedly to them.

[h1][u]The Multiplayer[/u][/h1]
I asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. 

When you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.

Though honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!

[h1][u]Ending Thoughts[/u][/h1]
I loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly :( Also, I don't care what anyone says, Fia's hugs are nice and warm.

Seeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.

The only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone ([spoiler]Farum Azula, cough[/spoiler]), and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. It's also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. 

I have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. 
The optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.



Other than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.

Even if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. 

Suffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I [b][u]highly recommend[/u][/b] the game!

1085660,Destiny 2,"Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.
I've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.
It's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.
I bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.
Forsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.
The game may be ""Free to play"" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.
Yes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:
Raids, high quality but the same ones every time
Strikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones
Dungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety
Seasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story
Crucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps
Gambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool
Seasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season
None of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.
And it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that ""by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps"" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.
And getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:
Overwhelming
Confusing
No sense of clear direction
All the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc
Why was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)
Any many more comments that made them not want to play the game.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"Star Wars the Old Republic is a game that has been around for eight years now, but it was never able to shake that bad reputation from its early days. Even as of now, people are asking if the game is dead.

But the truth is far different. Whether you’re new to Star Wars: Legends or new to MMOs in general, the game is most definitely worth playing in 2020.


The biggest complaint about the game at the time of launch was that there was no end. But that problem was only for players who rushed to end game for the purpose of PVP and group content. They never took the time to play the game as the developers intended, experiencing the story first.

However, the fault was not completely with the SWTOR Developers. Lucasarts closed Star Wars: Galaxies five days before the game’s launch, so Galaxies fans who wanted to continue as they had were vastly disappointed. And for several years, there were still people playing SWTOR who complained that the game just wasn’t Galaxies.

However, in 2020, there’s a LOT of end game. There are currently 30 Flashpoints, which are four-person quests for players to run through together. There are also currently 12 Operations, which are 8-16 player quests with lots of difficult bosses. And both Flashpoints and Operations have multiple difficulty settings.

And if you’re into PVP, there are five maps for team-based PVP, and doing well in these allows players to go into Ranked PVP. Doing well in Ranked PVP allows players to get onto the SWTOR.COM leaderboard, which gets updated every two hours. And if you keep the top spots until the end of the season, you get in-game rewards.

But what’s important to remember is that Star Wars the Old Republic is and always will be a story-focused game. Beginning in 3641 BBY, you take on the role of eight class stories across two factions, with four stories per faction. And these are widely considered the best stories in the game.

After the class stories are done, players head into the faction stories that are Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Shadow of Revan before heading into Knight of the Fallen Empire and Knights of the Eternal Throne, which sets up the storyline going forward. In Knights of the Fallen Empire, your character becomes the leader of an Alliance of specialists and Force users in their attempt to bring down the Eternal Empire.

The current ongoing story comes out of that and returns to the faction specific story, but now with the ability to sabotage your original faction. This means that there are four possible stories instead of just the two faction stories now; loyalist Republic, saboteur Republic, loyalist Empire, and saboteur Empire.

If you’re interested in crafting, there’s a wide assortment of armors and weapons to craft. And thanks to the Outfit Designer, you can keep multiple specific looks available to you and still keep your up to date armors with your highest stats possible. And even though it’s not part of the game right now, the developers plan to eventually add weapons to the outfit designer.

And this game is ripe with roleplay opportunities. Not only can you roleplay with your friends or guildmates, but the game also offers many opportunities to shape the stories as you see fit. In addition to the previously mentioned loyalist/saboteur storylines that came from Onslaught, players can play a Light Side or Dark Side characters, kill or let certain NPCs live, and depending on the class, have multiple endings. For example, the Sith Inquisitor can have one of 3 Sith titles given to them based on their alignment; Light Side, Dark Side and Neutral. And given the current “commit yourself to one side fo the Force” system, the Neutral title, once a pain, is easy to get.

There’s a lot to do in Star Wars the Old Republic in 2020, and the best part is that you don’t need to spend any money to experience most of it. In 2012, the game went to a free to play model, and with the release of Onslaught, that gave free players access to more of the game. Free players now have access to 60 levels, up from 50, up to the Shadow of Revan expansion, up from the vanilla game, and can now have access to 1 million credits, up from 200,000 for completely free players and 350,000 for preferred players. And if new players want to see what comes after that, they only need to subscribe for 1 month to permanently unlock everything up to the current expansion, as well as all content to come with that expansion.


So is Star Wars the Old Republic worth playing in 2020? Absolutely. An with it being a free game, you’ve got nothing to lose but time for checking out.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"Is this game worth recommending to other players in its current state?

No.

It's so extremely buggy, at times unplayable. The lag is fucking crazy, you cannot run this game on anything above the lowest settings otherwise your PC will fry.
You need to use the console to lower your settings further, turning off shadows/clouds ect. Just to get 60 fps. But don't worry you'll crash multiple times in an hour anyway due to fatal errors. 

I'm honestly in disbelief the state this game was launched in. And the updates barely help.

I'm posting this review shortly after the announcement they've made about Scorched not coming out until March, even though it was promised on launch. Aswell as letting us know that there are these new DLCS for our DLCS, that you have to pay extra for to get skins, engrams and the new dinos that come with the DLC maps that were originally 'free'... 
I'm not sure how many times Studio Wildcard is going to go back on their word or delay releases but surely it's a record at this point. 

They somehow managed to sell us the same game that runs shitter, and squeeze more money out of us for the ONLY NEW CONTENT (New dinos) and push it back to up to 2 years release.

At this stage. Don't buy the game, it's not worth it. Right now, just wait until there are enough updates/fixes. And hopefully enough of our voices to stop this DLC Paytowin ontop of DLC ontop of Remake is aborted.

Granted if ASA somehow changes my mind and I think its worth recommending, I'll gladly update this review.",game worth recommending player current state extremely buggy time unplayable lag fucking crazy run game anything lowest setting otherwise pc fry need use console lower setting turning shadow cloud ect get 60 fps worry crash multiple time hour anyway due fatal error honestly disbelief state game launched update barely help posting review shortly announcement made scorched coming march even though promised launch aswell letting u know new dlcs dlcs pay extra get skin engram new dinos come dlc map originally free sure many time studio wildcard going go back word delay release surely record point somehow managed sell u game run shitter squeeze money u new content new dinos push back 2 year release stage buy game worth right wait enough update fix hopefully enough voice stop dlc paytowin ontop dlc ontop remake aborted granted asa somehow change mind think worth recommending gladly update review

The game is full of sleazy ways to get you to spend money. For example, the game goes as far as to constantly send you reminder messages to play certain DLCs, even if you do not own them with no way of disabling these messages.

I ended up buying the $120 ultimate edition, which was a major mistake. By the way it's advertised you would assume you would be able to access all the content the game has to offer. After all, included in the bundle is a ""Season Pass"" which gives you access to a bunch of DLCs.

Upon finishing the main story and finally coming around to play the DLCs, I found out that I can't even play some of them because THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER SECOND SEASON PASS YOU HAVE TO BUY FOR $30 TO ACCESS THEM ON TOP OF THE $120 I ALREADY PAID FOR THE ULTIMATE EDITION.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"We're all aware of [b]Skill-Based Matchmaking[/b] (SBMM). 

...but have you ever heard of [b]Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking[/b] (EOMM)? That's what MW2022 uses.

Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.

Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 ([url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US10857468B2]source[/url]):

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
    ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and [b]the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session[/b] in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.

    For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so [b]may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases[/b] due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session.
[/quote]

TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill. 

Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:

[quote=Activision Patent US10857468B2] 
Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, [b]such as influencing game-related purchases[/b], suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games.
[/quote]

This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it.

270880,American Truck Simulator,"This is the first time I've ever left a review on Steam, but I had to.

Let me preface this by stating I am a CDL instructor.

While the game can't mimic certain real life situations, the amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive. I have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the life, but firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noises, the turn indicator, the traffic, the air brakes, all of it takes me back.

I'm not going to sit here and nitpick out everything it didn't quite get right, like how if you try to GTA it, you have increasing fines but IRL you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol. I'd rather focus on what it DID get right.

Speaking of fines, the way they increase really makes it so if you do try to GTA it, you'll eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load. Making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe driving.
I purposely tried three profiles up to about level 20 each. I drove like a bat out of hell on the first as a gag, quasi crazy the second one, and perfectly safe the third time. I noticed that I made more profit with fewer deliveries by driving safe. So while the game can't take away your CDL for constantly running red lights and scraping the side of a car, the fact you just simply can't make a profit unless you drive safe was a nifty implementation.

I could go on and on about this game and the nostalgia for the open road it gives me, but I'd rather be playing it right now. I tried the demo, immediately pulled in, bought it on sale, and once I really experienced it, I didn't even question buying all the available DLC and now anxiously awaiting the new states.

Quick mention about Wyoming and Texas:
I'm going to enjoy driving Wyoming in this game as driving it in real life was an absolute headache with how often I-80 has chain ups for ice and shut downs just for strong winds that could blow your trailer clean over. So that's a reason I'm GLAD it's not 100% realistic.

For Texas, make sure you put the entirety of Dallas under construction....forever. Make sure no one ever uses a blinker. And make sure any shippers in Laredo have trailer yards so small that even the most skilled driver/gamer can't park a damn thing in it because they just simply can't move.

.....I hated Laredo loads. Can't you tell?

I will be constantly throwing my money at this game. I hope this goes far. I hope the devs never lose their passion for it. I hope it stays alive long enough to see the entire continental 48. Hell, I hope -I- stay alive long enough to see that lol. I would love to hop I-40 from Barstow clear to Wilmington, NC. Or I-10 from Cali to Florida.

I can't say enough good things and most have tuned me out by now so I'll wrap up.

I can't thank you enough for this game.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"[h1] A Beautiful and Innovative Masterpiece [/h1]

I was initially excited to play Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice because of the celtic mythology themes and settings. While it is the most involving and seriously visceral treatment of the subject that I've experienced in a game, it has turned out to be so much more. 

[i] There are those who want so much to see beyond the veil. But when they finally do, all they want is to cover their eyes and pretend that what they've seen doesn't exist. [/i]

[b] Story [/b]
The story is the fundamental feature of this game. Certainly it deals with the richly textured mythos of the ancient celts, but from the vantage of a character that may be unique in gaming. I have to say that I was, and still am, more than a little irritated by the intro screen from the devs addressing the depictions of psychosis in the game. To me, this is a spoiler. As good as the story is, it would have been so much better if they had allowed the player to gradually realize this aspect on their own, as it unfolded in the narrative. Instead, as the true nature of the character and her circumstance becomes more apparent, it has lost all its impact. We already assumed as much from that intro from the devs. And they did address the theme in full detail in the video that one could view at any time, but best viewed after completing the game. So this spoiler screen was completely unnecessary. 
That being said, it is still a powerful and moving story full of universal truths and existential wisdom. It is groundbreaking for its treatment of the central subject, the role it played in the character's society, and the effects of stigmatization still present today. It brings to mind the old saying, ""Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.""
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1104885933
[b] Visuals/Sound [/b]
The game is visually gorgeous. Ranging in theme from horror to fantasy, historical and surreal, it is among the very best uses of the Unreal Engine 4 that I've seen. It would have been nice to have advanced options for post-processing features so that I could turn off chromatic aberration, but it's a minor detail. With both Nvidia Ansel support and its own photo mode, the game is a screen archer's dream. 
Character models, animations and expressions, are digitally rendered from live-action actors, lending these aspects an ultra realistic look and feel. 
Also worthy of note is the excellent sound design. Ninja Theory put a lot of work and emphasis on this aspect of the game and it has certainly paid off, adding to the atmosphere of the game in a way that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. 
These qualities set the production values for this game very high.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1104952378
[b] Gameplay [/b]
Another of my initial expectations about this game was that it would be an interactive movie, having learned the average play time and seen some cinematics. I was, happily, wrong. The combat is fun and fluid, with a variety of difficulty settings to suit anyone. I would liken it in style to the Batman series or Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. While not as complex or involving as those combat styles, it has the same feel, with blocks and dodges, heavy and light attacks, and truly satisfying slow motion finishing moves. 
Along the way there are many puzzles that I found to be fun and innovative. I love puzzle games and have not encountered any similar. They deal mainly with pattern recognition in the environment, or in reconciling a dissonance in patterns. Having watched the video from the devs at the end of the game and learning their reasoning for this style of puzzle, I find them all the more interesting. 
I love that there is no hud, no user interface, no hovering directions to ""Push F to interact."" This is refreshing, and rare in games. The things that can be interacted with are logical and fairly apparent with a little exploring and expirementing. It is a facet of the game that adds immensely to the realism and immersion. 
Detractors may accuse the game of being linear rather than open-world. But in my experience, an open-world setting doesn't always work well for some games. Here, the gameworld is a means to an end, that end being the telling of the story. So the world design and progression feels natural and right for the story. It is not entirely linear, there are many areas to explore. But in the instances where there was a clear path, I was glad for the guidance.

[b] Value [/b]
I had thought that 29.99 US would be a hard sell for a 6 hour game. At an average of 5 dollars an hour to play, it had better be something truly extraordinary. That's exactly 5 times more than the highest I am usually willing to pay. But it took me just over 11 hours to complete, and earn all the achievements, over the course of two days. It seemed like much longer, because this game-world is dense, no filler here. And I can honestly say that if it had only taken 6 hours, it still would have been worth every penny. 

Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice reminds me why i play video games to begin with; to be transported to other worlds, other realities. To suspend disbelief. To live as another, if only vicariously, if only for a short time. No other medium achieves this quite as well as video games, and few games achieve it as well as this one.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Edit: TL:DR 
Best MMORPG I've ever played, definitely worth checking out. One character, ALL content including classes, jobs etc. BASE GAME AND FIRST EXPANSION ARE NOW FREE TO PLAY, with some restrictions. 

BTW. I have made some updates to this review to reflect patches.

I gave up WoW (or World of Warcraft) For this game. Why? You only need one character to play every class. [strike]The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs.[/strike] (Edit: They changed this feature not too long ago to make all classes self contained. They still level up into Jobs but you are no longer required to have a sub class to unlock the Job.) 

You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 95% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a clique. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive (on some realms...like Molboro!). 

Dungeons are part of a finder in game. There is also a personal/free company housing system that allows you to have a space to show off and decorate in. As of Shadowbringers, dungeons in end game can now be done with a Trust system where you run with NPCs. There was also an update to squadrons that let you do up to heavensward with a handpicked NPC group.

The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The (original) opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words. Square has really outdone themselves with this title and I can't wait to see how they wow me with FFXV!

Edit: As per a commented question, The sub options come in 30/90/180 day increments and can be set up as recurring (thanks Pasty858). 180 days is roughly $78.
As a further Edit: The sub is required to access the game and comes in two types, one that allows only one character per realm (all that is really needed) and one that lets you have up to 8 (I think) characters per realm (for the altoholics). The 1 character per realm Sub is less expensive.

SO! Its been a while since I've played. after logging over 200 hours that weren't counted on here, and doing everything short of Savage content, I have to say that I never thought I would play a game that would tug my heart strings so much again. But this game. The most recent MSQ line just keeps the punches coming. It was amazing! 

Edit as of Dec 12, 2020
I'm now playing on the Ps4 as well as Pc, have logged another 1000 hours and am almost endgame again, I was not thrilled with Stormblood but Shadowbringers is amazing so far!


If you love FF games, you must give this one at least a one month ([strike]or 14day[/strike] trial now goes up to heavensward content, see below) trial period!

A note to anyone new, the free trial is now available all the way up through level 60 and the first expansion Heavensward! I'm not sure how long the trial lasts, but it free to anyone and now is the best time to jump in! Exp has been increased, Main Storyline Quests have been optimized and new Jobs have been added.

I would like to add a note, now that I have finished MSQ for Shadowbringers, please don't level skip. If you do, please at least go back and learn basics. If you're not interested in the story, fine but don't let that stop you from being the best you can be at your chosen role.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"So, I hated this game at first...

 I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of ""FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO"" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. 

It is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.

So I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.

Now I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.

Add-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.

For those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.

If any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"[h1]Most enjoyable grind ever[/h1]

I’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.

For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.

The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.
Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.
There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.

It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.

You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.
Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?

I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.
From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.

The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. 
Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.

Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.

Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers.

1063730,New World,"EDIT:  Leaving my original review below because the majority of it is still valid.  Updating my review to account for the changes in Brimstone Sands.  

UPDATED REVIEW:  

Since I first reviewed this game there have been a HUGE amount of improvements, two new weapons and a whole new zone.  This is starting to be the game it should have been at release with travel costs worked out, storage issues all but resolved and group finder that kinda sorta does what it should.  The gear grind is still there but it isn't nearly as painful as it was and they even implemented more ways that Solo/Casual players can get shards.  Finally, they gave Fresh Start servers which brought a bunch of people back to the game (it remains to be seen how long they'll stay).  

The reason I can't change my review to Recommend is that devs are still blatantly pro-melee.  They're not even denying it anymore.  You don't need to see it in the constant nerfs to mages (at least they stopped picking on healers for a bit), you just need to watch what they say in their dev streams and interviews.  Then they released the Greatsword, which is hands down the strongest weapon in the game, bar none.  If they would at least pretend that they want this game to be fun and fair for every playstyle we could maybe turn a blind eye to their obvious melee favoritism, but they aren't even pretending anymore.  

And then you have the sad state of affairs that is OPR--the one game mode where melee doesn't dominate.  Instead, you have devs who have, by design, allowed musket players to have CoD in New World.  And then, just for good measure, they threw in Mortal Empowerment and thought it was a good idea.   

Overall, this game is now, at least, starting to get on the right track.  If you enjoy playing Tank or Melee DPS, this game is for you.  Healing has been gutted from what it once was, but it's playable and they aren't planning more healing nerfs in the near future so that's a plus.  Ranged DPS, and especially mages, should probably look elsewhere for their enjoyment. 

We all hold out hope the devs will get better at balancing, but given their track record I don't think I'd put too much faith in that.   

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I don't think I've ever taken the time to review a game in the 11+ years I've had Steam.  However New World's current direction has compelled me to let future potential buyers know what they're getting into.

I'm a old man, people.  I'm old enough that many of the people playing this game could be a child of mine.  My first MMO was Ultima Online (Pre-Tram) and I've played every major (and most non-major) MMOs since then.  I love the genre, even if I don't always enjoy every game that releases in the MMO realm.  

I'll save you a long and boring rant (which would just cover everything that the other negative reviewers have already covered).  But to sum things up:

1) New World is a great game with a lot of potential that has been marred by a steady stream of patches and updates which reflect poor dev team decisions.  These patches show that the devs listen to a subset of outspoken or otherwise ""popular"" people (looking at you streamers/content creators) and not the more rational player base as a whole.  

2) The Devs, if judged by their actions alone, are clueless about balance and quality of user-experience in an MMO.  Either that or they are making very purposeful decisions that set up future ""boost"" items in their cash shop.  I really don't know which is the case.  

3) The endgame methods to improve your gear (one of the main goals of all MMOs) were already terrible.  Their ""watermark farming"" method was a pain before, but recent changes have made it an even more difficult process.

4) With regard to #3 above--if you haven't been max level for awhile now you are almost never going to catch up at this point.  Those of us who were able to get our watermarks up when at least some of the watermarking content was doable either solo or in small groups will have a huge advantage over new 60's--especially on smaller servers.  Most watermarking content now can only be done by zergs.  If you play on a large server it's not much of an issue, but the smaller servers are going to have problems.

5) Faction imbalances are a major problem and this game has no sound way to deal with this issue.

6) Healers:  Don't come to New World if you enjoy the healing playstyle.  I play healers/support in every MMO where such classes are an option.  New world has healing, but they nerf it every patch.  They do this because those loud, influential voices complain about healing.  The Devs are not done nerfing healing--more will come because even after drastically reducing healing in the last patch (and the 3-4 before it), the same voices are still complaining.  Add in the lack of raid frames or even group member hotkeys and healing become a frustrating, unfun experience.

7) Anyone with MMO experience expects the Meta to change from time to time but since launch the meta has been and always will be (if the Devs continue to act as they have been) the same.  Anything that threatens the Great Axe/Warhammer meta gets nerfed (healers, mages, bow).  Outside the brief period when Hatchet was OP due to a bug, the Meta of Gaxe/WH hasn't changed.  

8) Bugs.  I won't complain too much about this because I understand that every new MMO is filled with bugs.  Same with exploits.  I can be forgiving here but I cannot deny that the bugs and exploits have severely impacted player experience.  Heck--I'm currently the victim of the latest bug where you lose 5 attribute points every time you respec.   This will get fixed eventually, I'm sure, but it is undeniably frustrating.

To summarize, I am unable to recommend this game to new players due to the direction we can all see the Devs taking New World.  They nerf based on the desire of the vocal minority, they make end game harder to drag out the watermarking experience and they seem to create 2 problems every time they fix one.  

This game needs about a year to mature and even out.  Save your money until then.",edit leaving original review majority still valid updating review account change brimstone sand updated review since first reviewed game huge amount improvement two new weapon whole new zone starting game release travel cost worked storage issue resolved group finder kinda sorta gear grind still nearly painful even implemented way solo casual player get shard finally gave fresh start server brought bunch people back game remains seen long stay reason change review recommend devs still blatantly pro melee even denying anymore need see constant nerfs mages least stopped picking healer bit need watch say dev stream interview released greatsword hand strongest weapon game bar none would least pretend want game fun fair every playstyle could maybe turn blind eye obvious melee favoritism even pretending anymore sad state affair opr one game mode melee dominate instead devs design allowed musket player cod new world good measure threw mortal empowerment thought good idea overall game least starting get right track enjoy playing tank melee dp game healing gutted playable planning healing nerfs near future plus ranged dp especially mages probably look elsewhere enjoyment hold hope devs get better balancing given track record think put much faith original review think ever taken time review game 11 year steam however new world current direction compelled let future potential buyer know getting old man people old enough many people playing game could child mine first mmo ultima online pre tram played every major non major mmos since love genre even always enjoy every game release mmo realm save long boring rant would cover everything negative reviewer already covered sum thing 1 new world great game lot potential marred steady stream patch update reflect poor dev team decision patch show devs listen subset outspoken otherwise popular people looking streamer content creator rational player base whole 2 devs judged action alone clueless balance quality user experience mmo either making purposeful decision set future boost item cash shop really know case 3 endgame method improve gear one main goal mmos already terrible watermark farming method pain recent change made even difficult process 4 regard 3 max level awhile almost never going catch point u able get watermark least watermarking content doable either solo small group huge advantage new 60 especially smaller server watermarking content done zergs play large server much issue smaller server going problem 5 faction imbalance major problem game sound way deal issue 6 healer come new world enjoy healing playstyle play healer support every mmo class option new world healing nerf every patch loud influential voice complain healing devs done nerfing healing come even drastically reducing healing last patch 3 4 voice still complaining add lack raid frame even group member hotkeys healing become frustrating unfun experience 7 anyone mmo experience expects meta change time time since launch meta always devs continue act anything threatens great axe warhammer meta get nerfed healer mages bow outside brief period hatchet op due bug meta gaxe wh changed 8 bug complain much understand every new mmo filled bug exploit forgiving deny bug exploit severely impacted player experience heck currently victim latest bug lose 5 attribute point every time respec get fixed eventually sure undeniably frustrating summarize unable recommend game new player due direction see devs taking new world nerf based desire vocal minority make end game harder drag watermarking experience seem create 2 problem every time fix one game need year mature even save money
1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I'll post a full review later but just wanted to warn anyone out there that after buying the game you download a ~600MB launcher. The game itself is a ~90GB download from that launcher. The problem is, the launcher being open appears to being counted as play time, so just a heads up if you were thinking to return it if you don't like it. But, based on everything I've seen, it's clear that this is going to be a phenomenal sim, but just wanted to let people know.

Also, for those of you, like me, who are installing this to a secondary drive, note that your main drive (C:\) will need to have at least 8.4GB free as it uses a ""Rolling Cache"" that's located in %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator

Edit: Earlier I said that it “appears” that the launcher being open counts as play time. I can now confirm that it DEFINITELY counts as play time. Left machine running overnight to download and install and came back to learn that Steam thinks that I’ve been a pilot for 7 hours. Just 243 more and I’ll get my CPL!

For those of you who want to leave and let it install, at least in my case, I came back and it looked as though the launcher had frozen at 15% (that’s where I left it when I locked my PC). I exited the launcher and reopened Microsoft Flight Simulator via Steam to learn it had fully installed. Important thing to note, I didn’t put my PC to sleep overnight, I just locked it and made sure it wouldn’t automatically put itself to sleep by changing the sleep setting in Windows Settings.",post full review later wanted warn anyone buying game download 600mb launcher game 90gb download launcher problem launcher open appears counted play time head thinking return like based everything seen clear going phenomenal sim wanted let people know also like installing secondary drive note main drive c need least 8 4gb free us rolling cache located appdata roaming microsoft flight simulator edit earlier said appears launcher open count play time confirm definitely count play time left machine running overnight download install came back learn steam think pilot 7 hour 243 get cpl want leave let install least case came back looked though launcher frozen 15 left locked pc exited launcher reopened microsoft flight simulator via steam learn fully installed important thing note put pc sleep overnight locked made sure automatically put sleep changing sleep setting window setting
594650,Hunt: Showdown,"Genre - FPS Western Horror Battle Royale with Strong PvE elements

I got this game to try out my new PC and played a few missions solo. Enjoying the challenge and making progress both in terms of my character unlocks and skill level. You have to hunt a demonic entity whilst fighting/avoiding various mobs with a selection of weapons and tools

Then I got dumped into PvP mode. Now about 50% of games I have played have been with evenly skilled teams and some of my team mates have not been complete d***s. However,  50% have been quite the opposite, and this is where the game falls down. Someone shooting you as you soon as you spawn, camping at the top of stairs with a shotgun, or at the extraction point killing you 1 second away from safety. Make this game more frustrating than fun.

When you get a 'good' game though, this ticks so many boxes, so I am giving it a thumbs up.

However, I think the only way to make this game great would be to add a co-op PvE mode with optional bots.

Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease.  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely.  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly.

What I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this.

But the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matter, death will find you in the end, but it will be a hell of a journey.",lived entire life game braved bitter winter sorted labeled crate canned food wondering long would last tended crop cursed misfortune plant disease fractured leg holed corner dilapidated warehouse dying thirst since lacked speed get home safely lived thousand life felt touch death many time surprised come swiftly learned death failure sweet release make mistake survived long time built impregnable safehouses self sustaining crop high zombie could reach simply different kind death death form boredom death make sense though last person earth world filled endless zombie happy ending point survive point create tale make snapshot experience memorable game really analogy life death compressed hour time choose spend time reflects personality keep death bay build wall hide run far away pick axe try fight matter death find end hell journey
108600,Project Zomboid,"Woke up in a house. Turned on the TV. Watched a cooking show. Had some baked beans. Read a book. Took a walk and got chased into the forest by a horde of undead. Ripped my clothes and face to shreds on the bushes and trees. It started raining. So I broke into a house and cut half my body on the broken glass. Smashing the window attracted another horde that poured into the house. Tried to fend them off with a spoon. Grabbed a microwave, ran upstairs and blocked the stairs with the oven. 

All my food and gear is downstairs... and the TV. So now I will miss the 12 o'clock show about wooden floors. And that really ruined my day.

221100,DayZ,"A review from a non-competitive, casual player.

From what I can gather, this game has two types of players/two types of ways to play.  The first is the competitive 1st person shooter type, who likes to travel alone or with a group of trusted friends, picking on all the other players in a dog-eat-dog environment.  I am not one of those guys, so I play on a newb server with other very casual players.  

As an introvert, I often play alone and like to choose when I interact with others.  DayZ is ideal for me.  I play on a newbs/noobs only server, not because I suck at the game, but because I don't like the hassle of chasing my corpse or starting over every time I die.  As a new player, I enjoyed the scrounge-for-survival aspect of the game.  It was suspenseful, and it is good I play on a friendly server because there were times when I was begging for food or medicine.  I've also played 7 Days to Die and while the midnight raids were exciting to defend from, I really enjoy the realism of the arma platform this is based off of.  Okay, so zombies, wolves and bears aren't too smart - but they still surprise me once in awhile!

After running around awhile learning how to play and how to best equip my character in terms of gear (which there's a big variety to choose from in clothes, gear, guns) I was able to save enough money to buy a shitty car.  (My server has money and cars that don't fall apart after hitting a street sign, which is good, because as I said, I don't like to chase corpses - or in this case, replace what I've worked hard to buy/build/collect.)  The car was a force multiplier for me.  I could throw a tent or some building supplies in it and build a base.  At first, I just roomed with others who knew how to build bases, then started building my own.  My first bases were simply houses in game with the doors and windows boarded up as necessary, with a gate/door and a code lock.  Mind you, the server I play on has LOTS of mods.  Vanilla DayZ is much more limited, and is really just survival.

Anyway, with a base, I had a place to store the prizes I found in my scavenging, and the car allowed me to drive around to hard-to-get-to loot locations and also to help others.  The vendors are WAAAY across the map from each others, so new players could often use a lift.  The map is HUGE!  (Charnaris)  

Now, as an experienced player, I've learned to enjoy the occasional wipe by Bohemia or the server owners to put new stuff in the game for us.  The initial rat-race when a server wipes to grab your favorite base location and get some rare loot before it becomes rarer is fun.  I enjoy grinding for a car right away so I can help others, as when there's a wipe, everyone is starting out again.  But as an introvert, it's easy to get lost on the map alone too.  I can choose when I interact with others without feeling guilty for ignoring people like in WoW where people are EVERYWHERE.  

Conclusion: I am an old man.  I play games to escape and chill.  I have nothing to prove to anyone.  So, playing on newb servers with lots of mods to add variety is my bag.  The fun for me is helping new people and the endless scavenger hunt to find my favorite rare gear.  There's no levels, or OP weapons or anything like that in the game, so no one is 'god' compared to another player.  The experience you have as a player is what separates you from other people, not your bling and flashy avatar.  I would recommend it for people who want a realistic survival game.  But remember, if you do go PVP, just expect you'll die and have your corpse looted and be surrounded by adolescent idiots.  You may have to hunt around for the server you feel most comfortable in.  I would recommend everyone look for a noob/newb server to start, or if you want to start out and learn hard-core, play vanilla on a PVE server.  I enjoy variety.  My server has 70 mods currently.  But it's also easy mode, so I can listen to lectures and music while I play.

Hope this helps! - Peiper

I have read a lot of complaints about campers, so let me assure you, I am one of those campers. Hunt: Showdown allows for many a play style, like rushing in with a shotgun, duelling with pistols, or sniping from far away. There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyle, so don't complain about it. I have played computer games for nearly 40 years now, I'm 55, and I cannot (and would not want to) compete with the Fortnight Kiddies (like my sons...).

281990,Stellaris,"I must say that I adore Stellaris overall, but in this case I think it's only fair that I review the base game. Is the base game a full experience at this point (2.1)? Sort of. 

In my opinion, Stellaris plus Utopia is the full game for single player purposes. All other DLCs add some neat stuff, but Utopia is pretty fundamental. 

I've seen other people say Utopia and all other DLCs are optional, but in my opinion you probably wouldn't want to play much more than 50-100 hours of Stellaris before buying Utopia. The other DLCs can be bought a la carte and in whatever order you like, and you can play for hundreds of hours without them.

Even though I think Utopia is that important, there are several advantages of selling base Stellaris and Utopia separately:

[b]Multiplayer[/b]

Because everyone in the lobby benefits from whatever DLC the host owns, you can play the fully loaded game in multiplayer/co-op for only ~$15 on sale for the base game. This also makes it really easy to get friends to join your multiplayer Stellaris group, as you can gift someone a Stellaris key and they are completely good to go. 

Stellaris is a really great option for game groups, as it's relatively easy to learn (for its genre), supports dozens of players, scales well to larger groups (as it is real time rather than turn based), and AI can continue to play on someone's behalf if they stop participating in the group or can't participate in a given game night. The low cost of buy in for the base game makes this all the more appealing.

[b]Trying out the game before investing a lot of money[/b]

While Utopia is needed for Ascension Paths, special civics (Synthetic Dawn is at least equally good in this regard to be fair, I'm just saying the base game lacks special civics), and any tall play styles (which really need megastructures), the base game allows all the basic empire types to be created and played with a typical wide play style.

You can get a decent number of campaigns out of the base game and learn how the early and mid game work (mid-late and late game can be substantially altered by DLC) before committing to any DLC. With a game like Stellaris, it really isn't possible to try it out in the 2 hour Steam refund window.

However, Steam family sharing is a better way to try it out if possible, especially if you share libraries with someone who has the DLC as you can decide for yourself what DLC is important and what you can do without.

270880,American Truck Simulator,"When I was a very small boy in the early 1970s, my mother bought me a book.  I do not know the name of the book, (since I could not yet read), but I've always remembered it as ""The Big Book of Trucks.""  Within the pages of that book, as you might imagine, were very detailed paintings of various trucks -- pumper trucks, garbage trucks, cement trucks, and of course tractor-trailer combo trucks.  The book absolutely fascinated me for several years (or so it seemed; time passes differently for youngsters than it does for adults), and up until the age of 12 or so, every time an adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, the inevitable answer was ""a truck driver!""  Seeing the movie ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and living through the late '70s CB craze just reinforced the notion in my head.

Fast forward to the age of 17 and I enlisted in the Marine Corps for the simple reason that it was the most expedient way to get out of my hometown and on my own.  After several years in the infantry, I got out and went to college, majoring in engineering.  I've now spent 30 years in the construction industry, rising to the position of executive vice president.  I am, by the measures of society, a very successful man.  But every time an over-the-road owner/operator drops off a load at our shop, I watch with green-eyed envy as he pulls out of the parking lot, heading for his next load and the open road.  Every single time that happens, I think of the junior college down the street that offers a six week truck driving course.  Since I do not wish to drop a zero off the end of my income, however, I sigh and walk back into my office to deal with the thousand problems awaiting me.  But my mind is on the highway.

In this game, the developers have given me the greatest gift anyone can present to another person:  the fulfillment of a fantasy.  On the weekends, I can hole up in my home office and run a trucking company, driving a rig across many states while listening to a stream of current pop music which I'd otherwise never hear.  I am transported to a different time and place in which I am once again young, where my future is not set and the world is my oyster.  I quite literally cannot put a price on that gift.

216150,MapleStory,"MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).

After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.

FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.

The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium,  the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.

The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds. 

The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.

Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone.

I found this game randomly and after seeing a few videos and streams of this game, I stopped watching so I could play it myself.

There's a reason the reviews are currently overwhelmingly positive, it's well deserved.

The art is unique and beautiful with different themes for each distinct area of the game. These areas have their own culture and language. You will learn new words and build sentences, and maybe help the people reconnect along the way.

Don't worry if you are not an expert at languages. You will feel so much accomplishment figuring out new words and learning the sentence structures.

- A vast, detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles and activities to clear. A Potterhead’s wet dream made manifest.

- Varied and satisfying combat system that constantly opens up new opportunities as you learn more spells, and stays fresh, engaging in the long run.

- Excellent customization possibilities, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, other than your very own customizable ‘base’ to furnish by hand at leisure.

- Exciting progression that portrays your growth as a wizard (or witch) rather well, giving you new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas.

- Solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable / unique enough, and incredibly, their writing isn’t complete garbage - kudos to that.
[/td]
[td]
- Excessively repetitive open-world activities in the long run, that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities.

- Combat balance issues with potions, ‘healing spam’ and unforgivable curses: especially when upgraded they prove overpowered and make most fights quite too easy.

- Most named foes and quest bosses (but not all) are just normal enemies on steroids, that don’t vary in mechanics and don’t have unique behaviors.

- Some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. Example: if you use unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody will give a damn.

- Underwhelming finale that doesn’t really reflect the importance of what you accomplished, and doesn’t give any detail about how your actions influenced other characters afterwards.

[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. 

The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.

[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]
The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. 

Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.

[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]
Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. 

Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.

[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]
Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. 

Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",h1 sum h1 h3 depth analysis h3 table tr th b pro b th

20 years of uneventful driving. Just cruising along, always watching out for other drivers and reacting.

So imagine my sheer glee at the amazingly destructive power in BeamNG.drive! I've been playing for a long while now, and it still never gets old. I've driven myself off cliffs, smashed into guardrails, and decided to see what happens when you DO get into an accident.

BeamNG.drive is basically like my playground that lets me do all the bad things that I've always avoided in the past 20+ years of bad driving. I get to smash and mob around like an absolute loon, chuckle and nod at the destruction, and then do it all over again.

There's also apparently other modes other than Freeroam, which I've played a few times and are loads of fun. Buuuuuutt....if you'll excuse me, I need to see what happens when I take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jump.",driving well 20 year never gotten accident 20 year uneventful driving cruising along always watching driver reacting imagine sheer glee amazingly destructive power beamng drive playing long still never get old driven cliff smashed guardrail decided see happens get accident beamng drive basically like playground let bad thing always avoided past 20 year bad driving get smash mob around like absolute loon chuckle nod destruction also apparently mode freeroam played time load fun buuuuuutt excuse need see happens take 3 wheeled unstable vehicle jump

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.

When I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be ""Skyrim Online"", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.

After playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.

The ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC's and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC's reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC's that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.

The  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn't realize was part of the game.

In the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill's, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say ""don't pay them anything, I will give it to you for free."" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.

I plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be ""Skyrim Online"" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"I can't begin to explain how excited I was for this game. I adored house flipper and all of the DLC. The game came out a day before my birthday so of course, early birthday present!! I planned to spend all day playing. But honestly I am shocked. All that waiting... For this?? 

Okay. So after sinking over 500 hours into HF1, I was expecting to be able to do the same. Not the case. The story is short. Like wayyyyyy short. Not many jobs to do after you've finished the story either. The houses you can buy, frankly I don't care for. And as for the characters, I feel nothing for them. I can't even remember their names. Very forgettable. 

I'll admit, I love some of the new aspects, the new flipper tool is amazing!! Change design, copy, duplicate, love it!! I also love the new trash collecting system and cleaning and painting system. However. The surfaces. They're all over the place!! No more are wall and floor categories. When you have OCD like me, it doesn't make it fun. The paint names are gone!! And decor is EXTREMELY limited. If you don't like a nautical/ocean kind of theme... Well. Enjoy the even more limited decor. There is hardly any paintings, pictures, rugs etc. The amount of decor available is sad. Compared to HF1 it is a downright joke. No carpets either. And I hate assemble mode!! What is up with that? A time limit to get 3 stars?? So what about us that have panic attacks under time limit situations? Sounds pathetic I know, but unfortunately it is a thing and yes, I hate it. 

What happened to being able to install your own things in a house?? Radiators, bathtubs, showers, sockets, fusebox fixing, lightbulb changing, sinks etc. Gone. All gone. No grass mowing, no planting anymore. No curtains. No fire in the fireplaces or candles!! (I am aware that is a planned update.) But I don't know... The entire thing just feels so rushed and lazy. It's like you've given us a few great new tools but at the expense of losing House flipper. That charm that made the game just so relaxing and perfect. Gone. I have gone back to HF1 and I think that's where I'll stay. Sad times. :(",begin explain excited game adored house flipper dlc game came day birthday course early birthday present planned spend day playing honestly shocked waiting okay sinking 500 hour hf1 expecting able case story short like wayyyyyy short many job finished story either house buy frankly care character feel nothing even remember name forgettable admit love new aspect new flipper tool amazing change design copy duplicate love also love new trash collecting system cleaning painting system however surface place wall floor category ocd like make fun paint name gone decor extremely limited like nautical ocean kind theme well enjoy even limited decor hardly painting picture rug etc amount decor available sad compared hf1 downright joke carpet either hate assemble mode time limit get 3 star u panic attack time limit situation sound pathetic know unfortunately thing yes hate happened able install thing house radiator bathtub shower socket fusebox fixing lightbulb changing sink etc gone gone grass mowing planting anymore curtain fire fireplace candle aware planned update know entire thing feel rushed lazy like given u great new tool expense losing house flipper charm made game relaxing perfect gone gone back hf1 think stay sad time

- Elite Chest Runs or World Tours straight up feel like cheating gearscore and how theyre played with massive zergs feel like  it is NOT the intended way
- Outpost Rush has terrible performance 
- Not enough weapon variety, everything feels busted in the right hands or gear setup, but most people in PvP play the same thing, rather than balance things or nerf them into oblivion, maybe creating more weapons and adding variety 
- Town Board missions are almost useless and incredibly boring 
- End game, as it is now, still isnt enough to hold my attention or really leave me the feeling of wanting to play, which is why im putting the game down again for a while 
- Crafting feels like ass 

I feel like AGS have made strides when it comes to NW from release,  but theyve failed to deliver a meaningful and interactive endgame.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"This game's aesthetic qualities and cute voxel-esque design are it's brightest aspects, supported by a decent core gameplay loop, and ultimately only held back by its unfulfilled potential. There's little here that exists poorly, but some other reviewers are keen to point out that this game feels like a fantastic early access game as opposed to a finished product. Not that the game is any form of buggy, but there comes a point relatively early into a playthrough that you've hit the limit of what the game has to offer, which sucks because the first so many hours are really fantastic. As it exists now, I still recommend the game to fans of cozy games, citybuilding, and RTS to a very small extent, but I definitely felt as though there is something missing.

582660,Black Desert,"Alright, so we're here: the Black Desert Online Steam page. Let me give you the lowdown on this $10 you're about to spend.It'll be worth it for maybe the first character you create and level up. The first 60 levels sort of fly by and you generally enjoy your time. Past that, you're in for one hell of a time.
This game is about as grindy as they come. It's great for those who want to spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours accomplishing mostly nothing. Your progress in this game is relative. There's always going to be someone more powerful, skilled, or otherwise better than you in some way or another. That being said, though, it won't really affect your gameplay much at all. 
Is the game fun? Idk, I guess. I've put so many hours in to it that I can't even tell if I'm enjoying it or not anymore. 
Graphics? Phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful. I sincerely cannot find a singular thing to complain about when it comes to how the game is designed. It's lovely. 
Controls? Most interesting combat system I've seen in an MMORPG to date. This game requires true skill and understanding of your class if you want to get anywhere in the PvP realm. 
Community? Equal parts helpful and toxic. It comes with its blessings and curses. Find yourself a guild that you mesh with and avoid drama like the plague. Don't make the mistake of falling in to anyone else's petty arguments, it will have consequences one way or another 

So, why don't I recommend this game to anyone? Mostly, because it's a waste of time. You experience gratification once every thousand years when you hit a TET or PEN. It's really just 50% PvP and 50% grind. It's not necessarily a problem, but it kind of sucks when you know that others are just dumping money in to services that do the grinding for you. If you had asked me if I liked the game when I got it, it would've been a resounding yes, but I can't recommend the endgame to anyone in good conscience.",alright black desert online steam page let give lowdown 10 spend worth maybe first character create level first 60 level sort fly generally enjoy time past one hell time game grindy come great want spend hundred upon hundred hour accomplishing mostly nothing progress game relative always going someone powerful skilled otherwise better way another said though really affect gameplay much game fun idk guess put many hour even tell enjoying anymore graphic phenomenal absolutely beautiful sincerely find singular thing complain come game designed lovely control interesting combat system seen mmorpg date game requires true skill understanding class want get anywhere pvp realm community equal part helpful toxic come blessing curse find guild mesh avoid drama like plague make mistake falling anyone else petty argument consequence one way another recommend game anyone mostly waste time experience gratification every thousand year hit tet pen really 50 pvp 50 grind necessarily problem kind suck know others dumping money service grinding asked liked game got would resounding yes recommend endgame anyone good conscience
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours.
Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :). I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update. 
Updated 5.5:  09/06/2021 up to date with Shadowbringers

Positive:
-Completly Noob Friendly
-Tons of Content with two DLC's (Heavensward 60)>(Stormblood 70)>(Shadowbringers 80)
-Chocobo,Chocobo and Chocobo racing.
-The brilliant soundtrack is very unique and captivating.
-Multiple classes that this MMO is unique with is having 1 character and being able to switch classes
- The one major thing that also makes this unique, is that in FFXIV, there is no rush in this game. You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything else.

Community:The community is amazing in certain perspectives that is actually more better than most MMO's. What makes this community so unique is just the cycle of players that are willing to help new players. Yes this is normal in all MMO's but in FFXIV we aren't forced to help new players but instead we choose to. That;s what makes this community so nice. Not all Communities are perfect or imperfect but the majority of this one is decently kind.

Heavily Story Reliant: Most MMO's always fail to captivate the player of the story in general. FFXIV is very unique in it's own standpoint that the developers actually put so much development and depth into this story that just makes you enjoy it . Also being that this is probably the longest story in all Final Fantasy Genres. This is probably the only MMO that can potentially make you cry just from the story. That is how good it is.

Dungeons/Trials/24 man raid/ Hardcore raids:

Dungeons: Pretty generic even in this MMO that there isn't really much to say about honestly. Maps are very unique in it's own sense even the mobs and bosses with their unique skills. Though each map will have it's soundtrack included.
Trials: Trials are Bosses that you will face during the Main story or a side quest. You will be with a party of 8 facing this trial. Every Trial is unique with it's own soundtrack. Though trials are not difficult, there are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hard.
Alliance raids: 24 man raids are pretty much 24 players clearing a dungeon with multiple bosses. It's not difficult but you will die a lot. These 24 man raids also consists of the Nier raid in the most recent Shadowbringers update. 
Savage raids:These are your hardcore raids. They are about equivalent to Mythic raids in WoW. But, you are in a party of 8 of what you do is important. Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content. The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks.  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka content.
Ultimate raids: Thought savage was hard? There are currently 3 Ultimate raids. Ultimate raids make's savage content look like a joke. These are for the hardcore players that want to take it too the next level. Ultimate fights can last for about 15-18 minutes. Each passing second or minute, there is always a new mechanic that is very unique. This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours. Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate. Though yes it's hard. But that is what makes this so much fun. The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon. But it's worth it.

Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly. For Medium-High End PC. A lot of people tend to not like this aesthetic of graphics because of the anime type graphics but it really seems to fit.

Free Companies: Aka guilds- Finding a very dedicated FC that is willing to work with their own community is fun. Being able to host events and sometimes do raids and obtaining benefits makes FC's worth going to. Joining a FC or getting into the community can help you not get bored but can significantly make your FFXIV experience better.

Enternal Bondings:  So this is basically a Marriage system that can help boost the XP gain of two of the couples are together in this game and a Chocobo and YES there are actual relationships between players but don't try to take it serious as a relationship game.

Housing: You can have you're own house or a FC house that are limited in each server.  There are even crafters that can craft housing items or just be able to have you're own garden. You have your own section of an area where you would run into other players that could be your neighbor or another FC.

Golden Saucer: Pretty much a land of Mini-games that has good decent amount of games to play like Chocobo Racing or Card games. People actually seem to enjoy this content that they sometimes live in it. They have unique glamours or mounts as rewards.

Gear: Gears can be obtained from doing raids, dungeons or crafting. Every gear in this game unique. There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny.

Eureka: Pretty much Legendary weapons or armor that have their own signature look and stats that can be used for endgame content. This usually takes about 1-3 weeks to be able to obtain 1 weapon but can vary on the time.  They are very grindy content.

Classes: You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into.So this means you do not need to make another character. There are 10 DPS, 4 Tanks, 3Healers, 7 Crafters, and 3 Gathers. Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle. You can be good with a specific class. But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you. This means even though you know your class. You haven't mastered it being there are rotations.

Leveling: Leveling: Leveling can completely vary on the methods that players use. But it can probably take about 1- 3 weeks or maybe less to max a DPS/Healer/Tank class. For Crafters and Gathers it can take probably a few hours to 2 weeks that can vary. Leveling doesn't feel slow or fast. It's just very moderate.

Crafters/gathering: Probably the most unique and yet rewarding content. There are tons of crafting recipes and gathering. Compared to other MMO's where Crafting and gathering are just sub-classes. In this game they can be a main class for players. Each crafter's are unique. Culinarian makes food for buffs even raids. Carpenter's can make housing materials. These are classes that can make you money and gear and being a crafter and gather is like playing a different game too where you can put infinite hours into this.

Negatives:
Monthly Payment: This is a subscription based MMO. But one thing in mind is that, if you do buy the steam version, you can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthy.

The story length: You will feel beyond rushed. The story is good and it's amazing. But too other players they want to reach the endgame content. If you are the type of player that only wants to play endgame and do raids. Then this is probably the biggest.

Conclusion:
You are not forced to follow a linear path in this game. You can be what you want to be is what makes this game feel so alive. You can be a hardcore player or a casual but you are not forced. This game is started to become more mainstream now and it's always great to have new players. To be honest this game feels like WoW when it became popular when Wrath of the Litch King was released.(Not a hate rant). This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame. Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should be.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"Hmmm....this is a tough one to review. It is a game, but it's also a serious look at mental psychosis - and as such feels like it should be treated as a worthy endeavour, rather than rated outright as ""entertainment"". But on the other hand it is also entertainment, and an artistic / creative / technical undertaking, and so has to be viewed that way too.

Let me say first that I don't have any mental illness, nor do I know anyone who does - at least not to the extreme extent the main character suffers from. From that unenlightened position I would say it's a respectful and empathetic look at what it's like to live with that inner chaos, and it doesn't seem gratuitous with it's depiction of hallucinations and schizophrenia.

It takes you on a harrowing journey, that can be quite effectively disturbing in places. In truth it's more worthy as an educational tool about these conditions than it is as a game - at least in terms of gameplay mechanics. See - the problem with this project is that it is a game, and games are, well.....gamey. 

But they can't make it like God Of War because that's a step too far towards being disrespectful to the subject matter (and it was also an attempt to step away from AAA budgets, making it a smaller production), and if they didn't have at least some conventional gameplay it would just be a fairly thought provoking walking simulator.

So you have fighting, which symbolizes the heroines turmoil, but is also slightly stunted as far as combat goes. It's tactical, and has some seriously gorgeous special effects, yet isn't as freeflowing as most of it's ilk. The best comparison I can think of for the combat would be the Prince Of Persia (cel shaded) reboot from a while ago. 

You have puzzles, which tie in nicely to her unhinged perception of the world around her, but are pretty untaxing intellectually. Both systems have relevance to the theme, yet are only passable at best as far as mechanics go. They're more developed than just being padded fluff, but if you go into this game hoping for an epic best in class action title....you will be disappointed.    

Beyond these average features, and how it explores something unknowable unless you suffer from it yourself, there's the plot and the level of writing - both of which are nicely done. Artistically the game is immense, with some stunning visuals from a technical and design perspective. The audio is superb, with really evocative work done on the voices and sound effects - they advise you to play with headphones on, and it truly does enhance the experience. Senua is plagued by voices, and having them swirl around intimately within your own head is much more effective than just hearing them through speakers at a distance. 

So - two out of three for ""value"" so far, with a bit of a ""meh"" for the actual gameplay. The length of the game is fairly short - I think I took 6 hours or so to finish it, so that should be considered too. It's complete, runs well, is glitch free, and is quite responsive to control. It's not a product that will disappoint in those regards, but if you can't immerse yourself in the otherworldly sights and sounds (this is crass - but they are quite trippy), or get drawn in by the plot, then there isn't much for you here. 

As an interactive experience this is incredible, and has a level of craftmanship that is quite rare, but as a game it's only so so.

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"Chants of Sennaar is one of two games I played this year that I would classify as exceptional. It is an absolutely one-of-a-kind experience that should not be missed by any gamer who enjoys exploration, coupled with creative thinking.

First, it is visually stunning. The game is played in a tower with 5 levels - each masterfully created in a unique style with its own culture and language. The original sound track (instrumentals with some vocals) is hauntingly beautiful and this is a game (without voice-overs) that I played with my headphones on.

The core challenge  is to learn 5 different languages and associate meaning with the glyphs that  represent objects, actions, numbers, etc. This is not a decoding exercise.  it requires that you 'listen' to characters (by reading their conversations), interpret signs, analyze artwork, examine books, etc. to build context for each glyph. You have a journal that is used to track the meaning of the glyphs by conceptually matching pictures to each. You have the option of recording a note about each glyph to keep things straight in your mind.

What I really enjoyed was creating a conversation between two characters speaking different languages. In addition to knowing what the glyphs mean, you must figure out the sentence structure of each language (such as how plurals are expressed or the order of subject and object). This used a side of my brain that most games do not tap into and it was a joy to be successful! To add to the fun, linking cultures changes the environments you have already explored and you are encouraged to go back and see the impact.

In addition to a large game world that you can move through freely, there are puzzles to solve, machines to operate, formulas to combine, and a bit of 'find and use' with inventory. To keep you on your toes, there are some scenes that require stealth and others that require you to outsmart a monster. These should not deter anyone... they are not difficult and are solved by thinking rather than by perfect coordination and speed. The penalty for being caught is trivial (a quick restart to try again).

I started playing with a keyboard/mouse but quickly found that my controller was a better option. The controls are simple, intuitive and (for the most part) well documented within the game. I struggled a bit with the physical mechanics of a couple of the puzzles but was finally able to figure them out through trial and error. A 'Hint' feature allows you to highlight every hot spot on your current screen and this is an invaluable tool.

If you read the descriptions of the achievements, you should have no trouble reaching 100%, with one caveat. [spoiler] Completionists should visit the very top of the tower before finishing all tasks. When you restart the game from the last auto-save, you will then be able to continue and finish all achievements (including the 'true' ending) at your leisure.[/spoiler] This approach ensures that you will not have to play the game through more than once or manually manipulate save files to reach 100%. 

Your progress is automatically saved at regular intervals.  When you exit, you are told how long it has been since the last save.  I did not find this to be problematic and I never lost any progress that mattered.

Finally, there is a beautiful story that uses the framework of the Tower of Babel narrative. Things all come together towards the end, with some powerful social implications. Expressed gently, the message is not preached to the player. Instead, it made me think about the underlying meanings and reflect on how the game had quietly captured the impacts of a divided society.

To summarize, I can't find enough superlatives for Chants of Sennaar. I can only say that if you are open to an exploratory adventure that requires thinking (rather than leaping and shooting), then you should play this game.",chant sennaar one two game played year would classify exceptional absolutely one kind experience missed gamer enjoys exploration coupled creative thinking first visually stunning game played tower 5 level masterfully created unique style culture language original sound track instrumentals vocal hauntingly beautiful game without voice over played headphone core challenge learn 5 different language associate meaning glyph represent object action number etc decoding exercise requires listen character reading conversation interpret sign analyze artwork examine book etc build context glyph journal used track meaning glyph conceptually matching picture option recording note glyph keep thing straight mind really enjoyed creating conversation two character speaking different language addition knowing glyph mean must figure sentence structure language plural expressed order subject object used side brain game tap joy successful add fun linking culture change environment already explored encouraged go back see impact addition large game world move freely puzzle solve machine operate formula combine bit find use inventory keep toe scene require stealth others require outsmart monster deter anyone difficult solved thinking rather perfect coordination speed penalty caught trivial quick restart try started playing keyboard mouse quickly found controller better option control simple intuitive part well documented within game struggled bit physical mechanic couple puzzle finally able figure trial error hint feature allows highlight every hot spot current screen invaluable tool read description achievement trouble reaching 100 one caveat spoiler completionists visit top tower finishing task restart game last auto save able continue finish achievement including true ending leisure spoiler approach ensures play game manually manipulate save file reach 100 progress automatically saved regular interval exit told long since last save find problematic never lost progress mattered finally beautiful story us framework tower babel narrative thing come together towards end powerful social implication expressed gently message preached player instead made think underlying meaning reflect game quietly captured impact divided society summarize find enough superlative chant sennaar say open exploratory adventure requires thinking rather leaping shooting play game

238960,Path of Exile,"I will never stop playing this game.

This game is one of those games that will never, ever, be uninstalled. The classes are fantastic, the skills are even better, and the combinations of possiblities for character builds are absolutely mind boggling. While it may have a steep learning curve, if you enjoy ARPGs it is well worth investing the time to learn some of the more interesting mechanics.

Path of Exile is constantly updated with new content, new skills, new mechanics and various Quality of Life improvements. The team at Grinding Gear Games actually care about the integrity of what they are producing and also have an incredibly fair buisness model, no pay to win here. You will often find the devs posting in reddit, and the constant communication from the team in news posts, development manifests and incident reports when the servers go down are unrivaled by any other devs in the industry.

If you are looking for a new ARPG or even just something different to play then give it a shot. 100% free to play with only ethical microtransactions, there is no reason not to try it.


Edit: The content just keeps coming... Quality of Life, new acts, new skills, new end game, xbox release. These guys will never stop updating the game, there is always something new to do or something to try. There are regular meta changes and new mechanics. Even as a player who has committed senseless hours and support I find new ways to enjoy Path of Exile with every new league, race or build. Like I said, I will never stop playing this game because as of yet the devs have never given me a reason to (AoE nerf was pretty close though lol).",never stop playing game game one game never ever uninstalled class fantastic skill even better combination possiblities character build absolutely mind boggling may steep learning curve enjoy arpgs well worth investing time learn interesting mechanic path exile constantly updated new content new skill new mechanic various quality life improvement team grinding gear game actually care integrity producing also incredibly fair buisness model pay win often find devs posting reddit constant communication team news post development manifest incident report server go unrivaled devs industry looking new arpg even something different play give shot 100 free play ethical microtransactions reason try edit content keep coming quality life new act new skill new end game xbox release guy never stop updating game always something new something try regular meta change new mechanic even player committed senseless hour support find new way enjoy path exile every new league race build like said never stop playing game yet devs never given reason aoe nerf pretty close though lol
582010,Monster Hunter: World,"[h1]First Monster Hunter[/h1]
Ive been waiting for something like this for a long time. This game has single handily murdered my RL commitments within its first 2 weeks of being out. This review may be geared more toward newcomers such as myself. It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it’s so damn fun. 

So wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you’ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculous. 

Things will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You’ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You’ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you’ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.
As you progress through the story you’ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.

You can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.
As of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn’t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it’s not something that's constantly happening to us.

Another thing, when you’re out on a hunt, you can send up an “SOS”. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven’t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.

Other user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I’m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I’m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.

So thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist. It’s a f*cking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.

[b]Connection Update[/b]
On 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them.",h1 first monster hunter h1 ive waiting something like long time game single handily murdered rl commitment within first 2 week review may geared toward newcomer issue ill get also gon na explain damn fun wtf nut shell 5 big open world map map huge monster track kill harvest glorious innards level pick 1 14 weapon like class switch em well wan na try others craft better weapon armor part farm monster central hub astera probably spend lot time running side mission also progressing story unlocking new map monster adding upgrading beneficial npc hub within astera much content game ridiculous thing start slow confusing pretty damn difficult prob google sh fight especially first time going last 30 minute learn fight learn environment learn weapon learn item need bring craft almost everything game coating arrow food trap different potion different situation everything harvestable world plant nut animal bug fishing etc progress story go hunter rank story pretty much one long tutorial complete story mission hunter rank go allowing take stronger monster become powerful play entire game sp mp would say 60 70 time spent playing rl friend fun problem come right mhw pretty bad connection problem ive read worse people try run match making exclusively friend alone connection issue nearly bad others reporting saying problem exist u unplayable honestly varied day day day worse others happen literally take 5 10 second reconnect sh frustrating time especially mid fight something constantly happening u another thing hunt send so someone else need part certain monster respond so party 4 going target way play mp playing friend terrible experience issue like rest game connection issue nothing broken ive read various forum never tried connect match making cant comment outside others saying currently 2 patch capcom testing showing steamdb also note usually dont play 7pm est user complaint performance maybe lucky reportedly fix anything 980ti i5 4670k latest nvidia driver running 50 60 fps mid high setting 2560x1440 get dip 40 nothing game breaking least thats pretty much ive sh ton fun running game friend ive played good mp game awhile game definitely hit spot much stuff goal set wan na next helping issue personal experience way saying problem exist f cking fantastic game unfortunately getting review bombed due capcom slow almost lacking say response b connection update b 22 aug day posted review capcom patched game patch intended reduce connection issue folk continued iron ive 30 hr play time since honestly 0 connection issue playing mentioned review playing friend lobby running so mission 0 disconnect 0 mw error every single mp mission ive started friend ran sos since patch ended without single connection drop people still reporting issue match making joining random lobby cant comment issue since dont ever join

I tried to get my money back but you have 2 hours of game play to do that in. The 10% off isn't really worth it. Go play Alien Stranded Dawn or Furthest Frontier, Endzone or Surviving the Aftermath. Basically all the same type of game, different graphics. Nothing new here.

Amended review after several more hours since I can't get a refund. I think It's not worth full price, however wait a few months and maybe the price will come down and some issues will be fixed.
The game has great potential. Graphics are good, bugs are a minimum. However, the game is still like so many other games. My biggest issue is you apparently can't defend yourself.(spoiler) In one scenario you have 2 choices. To either bend a knee to a bully (labor thief) and give them the items they demand, or refuse. When you refuse they fire cannons at you and then you have to give them the items they wanted (you have no other choice). So.. 2 decisions but both lead to the same path eh? Sorry, that's an issue for me because if there is one I can spot, there may be several I don't see. 
I did type I did get a refund, and I immediately tried. I found my time was over the 2 hour limit and amended my review. I feel it kinda unfair that steam only gives you that 2 hours. There are a dozen games I can list that you really can't evaluate them within that time. Like I said the game has an extremely great amount of potential. If your a city/building/crafting game player it's fair. ADD the tower defense aspect of games and you got a game that folks will play and enjoy it more.

My time with Warframe spanned about 7 or 8 years. I am unfortunately at the point where I can't quite get into it anymore, which is sad but the memories I have from Warframe are super happy, to say the least.

Making the choice to try Warframe is one of the best decisions I've ever made. I made life-long friends while playing this game. 

Thanks to DE for everything they've done, I always felt supported as a player here. Absolutely legendary game, so much fun to be had.

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"This is one of those rare games that you play for thirty minutes at first, then in the evening you decide to do a little more; but before you know it, it's been an hour already. The first thing you do tomorrow morning is a two-hour session, which you stop because you don't want to rush it and you want to leave something for later as well, but then you just can't help it and you spend three hours glued to the screen, yawning, but going strong, because there's only a couple of achievements left for the full completion anyway.

Mechanics-wise, it's a game about deciphering unknown languages, in a way that's most natural for humans: by observing others that use it and by interacting with them. Visuals are highly stylized, and it works well with the vibrant color palette. Locations are memorable (when they need to be), traversal is easy, and nothing ever feels like a chore. You'll be swarmed by new words and alien concepts for a few seconds and you'll think you'll never be able to understand a word of what these weird people are saying and what their shrines are preaching, but as you walk around, little by little, you'll get a series of small aha! moments that will snowball into a fully deciphered vocabulary before you know it.

But beneath that, an equally important distinguishing feature of the game is a beautiful timeless narrative about our undeniable differences, inevitable prejudices, and ultimately the beauty and importance of communication.",one rare game play thirty minute first evening decide little know hour already first thing tomorrow morning two hour session stop want rush want leave something later well help spend three hour glued screen yawning going strong couple achievement left full completion anyway mechanic wise game deciphering unknown language way natural human observing others use interacting visuals highly stylized work well vibrant color palette location memorable need traversal easy nothing ever feel like chore swarmed new word alien concept second think never able understand word weird people saying shrine preaching walk around little little get series small aha moment snowball fully deciphered vocabulary know beneath equally important distinguishing feature game beautiful timeless narrative undeniable difference inevitable prejudice ultimately beauty importance communication

2198510,New Cycle,"Overall, a solid first impression!

The gameplay is fun, with a good amount of depth for the various aspects of managing the colony, graphics are alright [ though a tad monotone, I'd wish for some more color, especially within the buildings ], music is neat.

My only gripe, so far, is the progression. Early on I honestly got a tad bored.. sometimes really just had to sit there and watch it fast forward for 5-10 mins, until I finally got a new worker to do something with. However, about 3 hours in, the progression sped up rapidly. a LOT of random events started happening, new tech unlocked quite quickly, and with it came more and more resources & products to keep track of. In all of that, one somewhat lost track of the ""city-building"" aspect of the game. People got sick, fires broke out, some warship showed up and slowed down my production considerably, and workers went on a strike, all within 15 mins of playing.

This seems like a lot, but I think it could be solved with a small amount of tweaks - mainly to speed up events early game, and slow them down a tad in the mid-late game.

[AND NOW, AN ESSAY FOR YOU WEIRDOS THAT LIKE TO READ] (like m-me)
* (note: heavily based on my experience, your experience may differ according to your own personal preferences)


[Overview]
* I'm fairly casual in comparison to other more hardcore players. I stop playing for a few months after a session or two, but every time I touch this game again (usually on a whim) I just fall in love with it all over again despite having completely finished it several times already. Something about this game just feels really satisfying to play and every time i touch it, I was met with an incredibly pleasant experience (even though i die and fail a lot).

* Although, for complete beginners, the game is really easy to drop when you first touch it (I know since I dropped it when i first got the game) since you're not entirely sure what to expect, but take your time to learn the basics and do some wiki lurking here and there when you're stuck and you'd find that the game goes much deeper and offers an incredibly rich experience than you'd first expected (I know it did for me).


[The Game]
* Game flow fundamentally revolves around defeating bosses. You make preparations for boss battles which when defeated, unlocks more options for you to play around with to prepare for the next boss you set your sight on, progressively making you stronger but also changing the world around you, introducing something new with each boss defeated whether that be new equipment, or entirely new areas of the world. 

* Often times defeating a boss once won't give you everything you want, so you will occasionally find yourself killing a boss twice or thrice. Although, if you prefer, you can do them only once and move on which would be as equally viable as slapping them over and over until you have everything they can possibly drop for you (although it might be bad for the bosses' own mental health).


[The Experience]
* Terraria doesn't particularly demand you to play it in any specific way. You can play it in any way you prefer and at the pacing you wish to play in. It gives you a goal and challenges you but doesn't confine you to just a single exit, instead it gives you hundreds of tools to play and tinker around with in how you approach the obstacles the game presented to you.

* The amount of diversity in the way you can progress and complete this game in is outstanding. My experience in the game didn't feel predictable nor repetitive despite the game having clear checkpoints (the bosses) and a limited world (literally just an island). Despite always having the same biomes guaranteed to spawn in a world, each experience feel new and being acquainted with them does not make the experience bland but instead enriching it since the way you interact with your environment matters, making me feel rewarded the more I know and understand.

* It also helps that all content in the game whether it be building, mining, farming, exploring or just good old murder of local wildlife weaves back into the core game progression seamlessly without ever feeling out of place, making it easy to get immersed with the game. Thanks to this it does not confine you to any kind of play style, you may progress through the game however you want to, but it also does not discourage or punish you for straying off from the core progression.


[Conclusion]
* Its a good game, give it a chance and take your time getting used to it. Don't shy away from the wiki if you feel like you're really stuck or unsure what to do next. If you're not feeling like a hardcore masochist the game also offers a much more relaxed experience through Journey mode characters so try that if you're a really casual player. Fine tune the experience to the experience you're looking for and you'll find yourself in an incredibly pleasant experience (that also involves a lot of dying, but you'll get used to it)


So basically,
What i want to say is, this game is fun and i love it
I recommend it if you're bored

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"The year is 1176. I am playing as Alberto, King of Italy and Tuscany, and holder of many other titles. Events are progressing well. I am well on my way to my ultimate goal of creating the Empire of Italia, bringing Italy, Corsica, Sardinia and Croatia under my heel. As Alberto I have used my stewardship ability to build up the power of my realm to rival the Papacy, my next target. I fully intend to pass on a legacy to my son and heir, Sinibaldo, a promising child of many talents.

It was my occasional practice to grant titles to my children. This always carries the danger of them falling victim to some battlefield accident, but I sleep better knowing those titles are in the hands of close family. Sinibaldo has his own dukedom and is waging war on my vassal Duke Ugo, who is not a family member but who is a true asshole. The war does not go well for Sinibaldo and he becomes a prisoner of Duke Ugo. An unfortunate event, but surely he will simply be ransomed and we will all move on with our lives.

But several months later I get the shocking news: Sinibaldo has been executed! My only son, struck down at the tender age of 14 by the vile Duke Ugo--how can this be? I am enraged. In the heat of passion I move to revoke Duke Ugo's title, but he rises up in rebellion against me. The impudence! As I rally my troops the true extent of my mistake becomes clear--my other powerful vassals have also rebelled. With growing desperation I realize there is no path to victory. My last army is destroyed and I lose the war, my kingdoms stripped away, I am deposed.

I lean back in my chair and think about the rash idiocy of my actions. My son dead, my titles gone. I now have to play as my daughter and heir Benedetta, an eleven year old girl. It is time, I think, to pull the plug on this game.

But what of Duke Ugo? Can he be allowed to go on, after the vile murder of my son? No, I must bend every effort to see him brought down. And so I forge on.

As Alberto I had paid little attention to my daughter. Her guardian was some knight or other, and under her tutelage she had become rowdy, a warrior in a world of men who would never accept her as an equal. This, I thought, did not bode well.

As Benedetta my reign was immediately disturbed as the vassals of Tuscany formed a faction to remove me as Queen. But wait, this faction wanted to install a new king in place, none other than my own father, Alberto! I suddenly realized that as his only child, unless he fathered another male heir I would inherit his titles upon his death and once again the kingdoms of Italy and Tuscany would be part of the same realm. And so when the faction presented its demands I simply capitulated. Alberto was now King of Tuscany and I was Queen of Italy.

Yet my power was still not enough to challenge the evil Duke Ugo. To keep him close I appointed him my steward, but I also sent my spymaster to dig up dirt in his court.

Years passed. I got married, had children, quashed several rebellions, organized my realm and bided my time. When a Crusade was launched I led my troops against the infidels attacking my cousin King Mario of Jerusalem, returning in triumph and finally impressing even the most retrograde of my male vassals. The waifish eleven year old girl had become a warrior Queen.

But Ugo continued to plague me. As my steward he was often in my presence, always there to remind me of his evil treachery. I hosted a feast and there he was again, even trying to strike up a friendship! I coldly refused him, and he became my rival. The stress of dealing with him was almost unbearable.

And then the miracle--my expert spymaster had uncovered gold. Duke Ugo was a deviant!

This changed everything. I now had the key to bringing down my brother's murderer. But it must be done carefully--Ugo was still powerful, and I could not take him down as long as he and the other vassals of my realm opposed me. So I only blackmailed him, getting a strong hook that I would use to ensure his loyalty while I consolidated my position.

In 1211 I received news of my father's death. After the messenger left my chambers, I went to the family shrine and knelt in prayer, vowing to my father's spirit that his son, my brother, would finally be avenged.

More years passed. As both kingdoms were now mine, I slowly amassed enough gold and troops to take on my entire realm. A careful campaign of pacification had made my vassals compliant.

It is the year 1218, and time to put my plan into action. I expose Duke Ugo's deviancy. He is now a criminal. As my father did twenty years before, I revoke his title, and again, he rises up in rebellion, but this time no one will stand with him. My troops outnumber his four to one. With laughable ease I storm his palace and win victory. My knights drag him out and throw him down in the mud before me.

I arrest him and throw him in the dungeon. I revoke all of his titles and grant them to a distant toddler cousin. Years of emotional stress are wiped away in an instant--Ugo, my rival, murderer of my brother is now mine to do with as I will. Shall I torture him? Execute him? Shall I simply leave him there to rot in filth and misery?

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"2013, my first time playing Skyrim:

On my way to Bleak Falls Barrow, I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them off, but I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week later, I came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire. 

Confused, I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. However, as soon as I arrived, I was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this point, I had done some quests for the companions, so I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the city, with several of them hot on my tail, I burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-lived, however, as a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battle, the guards all lay dead on the ground.

Before I could celebrate, all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were going, I decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlight, I witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terror, but it was no use. Belethor, Adrianne, even Nazeem, they all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions. 

As I walked through the blood-soaked streets, I found a single survivor: Brenuin, the town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hiding, crouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to him, when I saw Farkas, axe in hand, coming into the pen. With a deep, gutteral voice, he says, ""Where are you?"" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow, ""Ha! Found you!"" he yells. 

Brenuin screams for mercy, but it's too late. Farkas's massive axe comes down on Brenuin's skull, splitting it in two, as the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood.

1248130,Farming Simulator 22,"I have played the Farming Simulator Series since FS11 and have logged many hours into the Series. I can tell you a few things 

1. This is NOT just a reskin of FS19. Many things have changed and honestly this is the best in the Series to date. 

2. Yes there are a few bugs, but nothing game breaking 

3. This installment has the best Material Handling. Just tonight I loaded a Semi Trailer full of Strawberry Pallets by hand with no issues at all. Bales have also improved a lot! 

4. There is a lot more in this installment then we ever have had before which will help with keeping you busy on the farm. Cows, Chickens, Pigs, and Sheep are the only Animals, but with the addition of Production Buildings it keeps you busy and wanting to work harder to own them. 

5. Starting maps are great (Unlike FS19) the American Map feels good, I just wish we had some sort of Animal Pen to start with and a Bigger yard, but again I am enjoying it. Working hard to grow my Farm land so I can get into Cows as I was a Dairy Farmer growing up, but the map is not bad. 

If you are a fan for Giants and Farming Simulator pick this title up and have fun! This is the first in the series they put out themselves and is the most optimized in the Series to date. It will only go up from here! 

6. I see this question a lot and you might see the bad reviews about the Season Pass. Is it worth getting? 
My answer is this.. Yes as in the long run ti will save you some cash. Yes there are 3 DLC's that are out now that ARE NOT included in the Season Pass, a Small tractor you will never use, a Black Beauty and a Mack Truck Skin.. the reason these are NOT included is because these were all some sort of Pre Order Bonus. 

The season pass will cover the DLC's for the first year but not the pre order bonuses. You will understand that if you read the description of the Pass. 

7. American Equipment is pretty lacking, but this is what is great about this series. If you played any others you know the Mod community is great and you will see plenty out soon! This again is not ""Game Breaking"" because like any farmer you need to make due with what you have. 

8. Crossplay is a thing now! Yes PC players can now play with Xbox and PS players, you are limited to the mods that Mod makers and Giants allows to be placed in the Mod Hub, but this is a start. I love it because I can now play with my Farming Buddy that only has an Xbox while I am on my PC. 

I hope this review helps someone that is not a Fan boy but has put in a lot of hours in this series.

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","edit 1: One patch, two hotfixes. Still borked.

Like previous Owlcat releases, the story and writing is quite engaging, and they've really nailed the Rogue Trader vibe.

But it is the [i]usual[/i] Owlcat release. Buggy as hell, overly complex rules for no reason other than to add arbitrary layers of complexity, never-ending filler combat, and about as polished as a rusted Soviet car.

I might change my recommendation later, but now? At release? Wait until it's either severely discounted and/or has been thoroughly patched.",edit 1 one patch two hotfixes still borked like previous owlcat release story writing quite engaging really nailed rogue trader vibe usual owlcat release buggy hell overly complex rule reason add arbitrary layer complexity never ending filler combat polished rusted soviet car might change recommendation later release wait either severely discounted thoroughly patched
899770,Last Epoch,"Just as a reminder this is a review during Early Access. Some things will change before 1.0 Release version.
I'm Playing during 8.1 March 18, 2021, and have played since sometime around 7.0. 
The game is an Action RPG like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, and Path of Exile. It has many things that the players would like in this genre. 
Classes Types (this is not class names in the game, but the general role they fill).  Necromancer, Wizard, Warrior/Paladin, Druid, Ranger. These classes have 1 base class, and 3 specialization trees within them that help you play the game in a way you may enjoy. Each with abilities that unlock once you advance, while also helping you define your character and playstyle further.
Lots of Abilities to choose from and alter through their ability skill trees.

Gear, and Gear Crafting. Not only do they have a large range of Armors and weapons, but you can also craft a more defined piece of gear. Some higher end gear or gear sets may help define a build you are playing.

Gear Gambling. A merchant that lets you gamble away your gold on a possible item. Helpful at later stages of the game. 

A decent challenge from both normal monsters all the way up to the various bosses within both the story of the game and end game content.  

Things That Are currently missing but are being added/ worked on and can be read on their Roadmaps.
Multiplayer, More content and bosses for story and end game, Other gear options, More abilities, More class trees. (The game is currently missing 3-5 Talent trees for the current available classes)

I do not know about PvP. Seeing as how I am not personally interested in it. From what I can tell It is not currently in the game. You will have to do this research on your own.

I personally enjoy the game even in its current state, which does feel a little lacking, but not by much. Another note. The company is rather helpful and communicates with its player base.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"After my main character, Emperor Illiya of Italy, a drunken fornicator and heretic, was assassinated while attending a ceremony, I switched to his grandson, Emperor Astore of Italy, who took to the throne at the age of 25. Astore was born of two white parents, yet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent. Despite looking nothing like his ""father"", he still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor. His sister, Agostina, who also looked to be half-black, ruled the neighboring Empire of Francia. Because the realm split when Iliya died, they both had a strong claim on their respective empires. 

Despite this, they both considered each other great friends. And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered. As an emperor, he was known to be extremely generous and kind. He helped put down many rebellions caused by his ""grandfather"", and restored much of the land which had previously been lost. By the time Astore was 75 years old, he had lived a long and content life. 

It all came crashing down, however, when an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor. Expecting the secret to be some mundane thing, such as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiers, Astore reluctantly accepted the offer. However, the secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astore's son: Agostina, his only sister, best friend, and faithful ally. 

Betrayed, Astore declared war on the 80 year old Agostina, shattering the alliance. The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executed. 

The fact that such an incredibly elaborate and detailed story can occur without any script whatsoever is amazing, and earns this game's acclaim.",main character emperor illiya italy drunken fornicator heretic assassinated attending ceremony switched grandson emperor astore italy took throne age 25 astore born two white parent yet suspiciously looked partial african descent despite looking nothing like father still managed empire much better predecessor sister agostina also looked half black ruled neighboring empire francia realm split iliya died strong claim respective empire despite considered great friend comfort friendship helped astore greatly firstborn son mysteriously murdered emperor known extremely generous kind helped put many rebellion caused grandfather restored much land previously lost time astore 75 year old lived long content life came crashing however extremely old man offered give astore secret exchange favor expecting secret mundane thing man india slept one courtier astore reluctantly accepted offer however secret nothing le true murderer astore son agostina sister best friend faithful ally betrayed astore declared war 80 year old agostina shattering alliance war waged 4 year eventually captured executed fact incredibly elaborate detailed story occur without script whatsoever amazing earns game acclaim
692890,Roboquest,"


Update :: The Summer Update really adds a ton to the rogue elements of this game. This is one heck of a team. Love their dedication.

Over the last year the Roboquest team has been working to take in community feedback. It is instantly clear how amazing the FPS model for Roboquest is, but only after a few short hours does it become just as clear the developers are struggling to find footing the Rogue Genre. This is where the feedback comes in.

The team has been diligently working to find ways to bring interest into the Rogue, but they're stumbling. They're changing subtleties in order to give the game rogue personality. At some point they're going to have to take a leap. Only changing out small digit numbers doesn't make a run feel any more or less interesting from level one to level ten.

Even if they removed the Rogue Elements this game's FPS model is the highlight in itself. The best maps are open ended, and don't use a path system thanks to the incredible movement and traversal mechanics. The team works for fidelity. The art, sound, combat, movement, and music are all stunning. If the team can bring the rouge lite elements up to their standard Roboquest will be an icon of the genre.

One of the best feeling FPS rogues out there. Totally worth playing, and supporting. After almost a year of them seeing what sticks I would not mind seeing the team take Roboquest into a story mode and diversifying locations, maps, and enemies instead of rogue abilities. Play to their strengths.",update summer update really add ton rogue element game one heck team love dedication last year roboquest team working take community feedback instantly clear amazing fps model roboquest short hour become clear developer struggling find footing rogue genre feedback come team diligently working find way bring interest rogue stumbling changing subtlety order give game rogue personality point going take leap changing small digit number make run feel le interesting level one level ten even removed rogue element game fps model highlight best map open ended use path system thanks incredible movement traversal mechanic team work fidelity art sound combat movement music stunning team bring rouge lite element standard roboquest icon genre one best feeling fps rogue totally worth playing supporting almost year seeing stick would mind seeing team take roboquest story mode diversifying location map enemy instead rogue ability play strength

"489830,1746860",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition,"2013, my first time playing Skyrim:

On my way to Bleak Falls Barrow, I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them off, but I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week later, I came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire. 

Confused, I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. However, as soon as I arrived, I was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this point, I had done some quests for the companions, so I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the city, with several of them hot on my tail, I burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-lived, however, as a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battle, the guards all lay dead on the ground.

Before I could celebrate, all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were going, I decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlight, I witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terror, but it was no use. Belethor, Adrianne, even Nazeem, they all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions. 

As I walked through the blood-soaked streets, I found a single survivor: Brenuin, the town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hiding, crouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to him, when I saw Farkas, axe in hand, coming into the pen. With a deep, gutteral voice, he says, ""Where are you?"" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow, ""Ha! Found you!"" he yells. 

Brenuin screams for mercy, but it's too late. Farkas's massive axe comes down on Brenuin's skull, splitting it in two, as the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood.

Unpopular opinion but I preferred playing with a controller, with occasional use of the keyboard for inventory management. I felt like I had much better control than with the keyboard. Preference of course. I highly recommend this game, no hesitation. 

I only have one point of feedback for the Devs - when a newcomer arrives to the checkpoint and tells their story about why they want to cross the border, it would be great if their goodbyes were voiced accordingly and congruent to their story. For instance, when a guy comes to the checkpoint crying hysterically about needing to see his wife who is admitted to the hospital, and you approve his entry, and he responds with what is effectively ""Cheerio!"", it breaks the immersion lol. Other than that, fantastic game and keep up the great work!",superb game fan paper please thoroughly enjoying one unpopular opinion preferred playing controller occasional use keyboard inventory management felt like much better control keyboard preference course highly recommend game hesitation one point feedback devs newcomer arrives checkpoint tell story want cross border would great goodbye voiced accordingly congruent story instance guy come checkpoint cry hysterically needing see wife admitted hospital approve entry responds effectively cheerio break immersion lol fantastic game keep great work

1063730,New World,"Got almost 2.5k hours on this game heres my mini review .

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Good/decent for a action combat mmo its like a 7/10 ,its worse than the likes of BDO and Lost Ark but its not bad,i found it fun.

[h1]Expeditions(dungeons)/Raids[/h1] 
5/10 ,most of their loot is completely useless and relies on 100% rng rolls on stats ,most dungeons are not hard ,they barely have any mechanics and the mutations (higher dificulties with gimmicks)are preety much just gearscore checks and add litle to the overall experience.

[h1]The endgame gear progression[/h1] 
Sucks its a 4/10 for me ,when you get to max level you'll unlock expertise for each slot ,this means that even if you buy a 600 gearscore legendary item it will downgrade to 550(as you start off with 500 expertise on all slots ) ,and you will need to increase first to 600 with the most effective methods being the most boring expeditions (genesis/lazarus) or chest runs which are a complete snoozefest where you run with 50+ people in trains in open world oneshotting all monsters in sight and opening chests,and then when you get to 600 on all slots you need to do mutated expeditions for umbral shards that you need to upgrade them to 625 ,aka you'll be doing the same two expeditions most of the time(mutated lazarus and genesis cause they way easier for new players than the other two and way faster than the others besides dynasty for old players) ,all 3 of those are incredibly boring to do once you've done it a few times .

[h1]PvP[/h1]  
6/10 - it deserves more but the devs dont give two shits about it ,nearly two years in and the most played PvP mode does not have more than one map ,there is no ranked ,no crossplay ,theres also wars but you'll have a hard time getting into those as a new player ,if you do want to get into them be ready to record yourgameplay though ,wars are realy fun i'd say its worth it.

[h1]Gathering[/h1] 
9/10 ,both the visuals the leveling the goldmaking the audio from it is great ,possibly the most fun i had gathering in any MMO ever.

[h1]The graphics[/h1]  
Also a 9/10 ,the world of this game is genuily amazing

[h1]The leveling experience in this game[/h1]  
Its realy good up to like lvl 30-40 and then brimstone at max is also fun ,but you'll find that the quests are very cookie cuter ""move here "" kill 5 wolves etc ,that said this is like a 8-9/10 at least ,the first time lvling in this game is genuily amazing.

[h1]The enemy diversity 2/10[/h1] 
Genuily dreadfull , the same enemies you see on the starting area you will see them in the very last endgame areas with a slightly diferent skin  with the the exact same basic attacks ,you might think this does not sound too bad ,surely it cant be that bad ,well i didnt mention that you will also see those exact same enemies in literally every single region you go to ,pirates wolves skeletons corrupted (Which are just skeletons with red colours ) bears brutes and little more ,bosses are not much better in this regard ,you'll probably fight over 10 diferent brute bosses and every other expedition has one .

[h1]Professions(trade skills as they're called) - 6/10 [/h1] 
-They're ok ,the gear crafting systems suck though ,you have to level a crafting skill to 200 to craft endgame equipment,then you need to get 3 major trophies of said profession which also requires 3 houses and the trophies are very expensive on itself ,and then you need a full set of crafting gear for said profession ,and then you need a foodbuff for said profession ,and then you need to have a house in a town that has a crafting buff for that profession active ,expect a investment worth over 100k gold (more than you'll make before reaching max level by quite a margin,some professions are more expensive) ,also after all of this surely you can craft good gear right ? No ,wrong ,you cant ,you'll have to rely on what i believe are 1/6 odds of hitting a legendary ,you'll also need preety expensive materials to craft ,crafting endgame gear will rarely ever land you a profit .

[h1]Do I recommend this game[/h1]

Are you a casual player just looking for about 50-100h hours of fun-Yes

Are you a MMORPG player expecting a game to be fun for years -No ,these devs have proven time and time again they're unable to see what makes a good MMO.

Are you a PvP player-Hell no ,this game might aswell have been false advertisement ,its not even close to the open world PvP state of the betas(nor do i want it to be)but as it has been since release ,balance patches are few and theres sometimes 6 months inbetween them,this is a mmorpg where you need several times the gold cap to gear but then your gear turns worthless several times a year because the devs decided to nuke your build out of existence ,and you might think this is normal with expansions in mmos ,the problem is they do it without outside expansions without adding any meaningfull content literally every single time .

Do i hate This game -Not at all ,but if you want to know why i got 2.5k hours on it the best way i can desribe it is this game is preety much the fast food of MMORPG's ,specially at endgame,its okayish if you got noting better to play ,but weather its in dungeons/raids ,PvP ,sidecontent,questing,story,preety much everyting besides Gathering and Graphics it falls short of just about every popular MMO.

1240440,Halo Infinite,"TLDR: Halo infinite is a fundamentally good, fun to play game which is ruined by a broken engine/servers and a company that is both extremely greedy and incapable of listening to player feedback. 

Game is so close to being good, but 343 clearly doesn't give a shit about their community at all.

Gameplay is actually really fun, when it works. It's a fast paced multiplayer shooter with good movement mechanics and pretty decent gunplay. I think the game is absolutely beautiful, and performance (FPS) is usually decent, if somewhat inconsistent across maps.

The problem is that there seem to be many issues with the game engine. First off, the servers are sketchy - sometimes performance is perfect, then drops to unplayable within the same game. Ping is often inconsistent, stutter/delay on any given player action is commonplace. Client/server desync is rampant, you'll die behind walls more in one game of Halo than you ever will in any other FPS. Rocket launcher doesn't 1 hit kill like 25% of the time. Projectiles disappear. Melee attacks don't register. Melee attack damage seems to vary randomly. Shots don't always register. Grenades disappear or do no damage. Guns ""jam"" randomly, preventing you from firing. Grav hammer damage is extremely inconsistent. Powerups sometimes don't trigger, or trigger the cooldown without the ability activating. Player collision doesn't exist, or is extremely spotty if it does, despite what 343 says. The majority of the time you find a BTB match with a friend, you will not be in the same squad, and their nametag is the same color as everyone else's. These are just a few I can come up with off the top of my head.

Honestly, none of these issues would be game breaking on their own. But there are so many tiny issues in EVERY SINGLE GAME that it drives you crazy if you play enough. I feel like I never know if I messed up or the game did:

""Did I just miss all my shots? Or did the server not register the hits, again?"" 
""Did they get a nice angle on me for the kill? Or did I just get shot through the wall, again?""
""Was I too far away to kill with that gravhammer or was that desync, again?""
""Did they react faster than me? Or did my melee not do any fucking damage, again?""

There is also a large disparity between controller and KBM users. This game was designed to be played with a controller and it shows. You can look up accuracy stats, controller players have better shot accuracy across the board. I realize that aim assist is an integral part of Halo, but it's still fucking annoying to get lasered down with an AR by someone with the movement of a potato, something that is actually impossible for a PC player to do consistently because of bloom. I think 343 needs to look at accuracy stats weapon by weapon and make some adjustments to bullet magnetism or something so that there is parity between KBM and controller (even if this ends up making some other weapons relatively worse on KBM).

Cosmetics suck. This game was supposed to be the pinnacle of ""make your own spartan,"" instead it's the worst customization they've ever had in a halo game unless you pay a fuck ton of money and/or grind out the entire battle pass. YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK YOUR OWN FUCKING COLORS. Whatever greedy corporate asshole is in charge of this game's monetization policy needs to be fired.

The battle pass progression also sucks. The challenges, where you get all your significant XP, are artificially difficult/gamemode specific and make you choose between progressing the battle pass and enjoying the game. You can't choose which gamemode you queue into, so if you get a gamemode-specific challenge, you have to just keep queueing and hope you get put into the right gamemode for your challenge. Per-match XP is laughable at a flat rate of 50xp per match, your medals have absolutely no bearing on your XP. You went 3/20 and lost the game in 2 minutes? 50xp. You went 35/5, singlehandedly captured 3 flags, and got a running riot? 50xp. Fuck you 343i.

Oh, you finally leveled up! Maybe you'll get a sick new armor piece, or a nice weapon skin! 
Nah just kidding, enjoy your challenge swap, which 343i has generously added to your battle pass so that you can PAY to get around their borderline broken progression system. Seriously, just name the item ""corporate greed,"" that's the only reason it exists.

I'm being pretty cynical here, because 343i continues to not fix any of these issues. In the 8ish months since the game came out, they have added two new maps and a few new gamemodes, and have made zero improvements to any of the issues I listed above. I want to love this game but if I play it any longer I'm gonna go insane.

In all, Halo infinite is a fundamentally good, fun to play game which is ruined by a broken engine/servers and a company that is both extremely greedy and incapable of listening to player feedback.

EDIT: 4 months later they have fixed nothing and added nothing. The gameplay was fun enough to bring me back despite all the flaws, so take that as you will. Everything besides the gameplay itself is utter dogshit. Microsoft needs to fire every single person responsible for this garbage fire and start Halo over again. Fuck you 343.

EDIT 2: A little over a year later, I no longer play at all. I gave the game another shot around the release of Season 3 and Forge, which was fun when it worked, but the Forge experience was absolutely terrible - the browser for custom games was shit, joining a game in progress didn't work like 75% of the time, just a terrible, clunky mess blocking access to some really fun gameplay (seeing a pattern here???).

238960,Path of Exile,"[h1]TL;DR: Go play the campaign, it's great! [/h1]

[hr][/hr]
So after 400 hours I think it's finally time I reviewed the best ARPG in the market, this will be a long review, but if you are a Single Player person, or coop player at most, that wants to try Path of Exile(PoE) for the first time, then this review is for you. 

So as a Diablo 2 player that played it single player and coop, I always liked ARPGs, and as it happens to all of us, Path of Exile shadow looms large over the genre and your curiosity eventually gets picked up by it. You probably have the same fears as me. 
[hr][/hr]
 [i]""Always online... is it multiplayer? it's some kind of MMO where I have to do dungeons with other people?"" [/i]

Luckily the answer is no. 

 [i]""It's free to play, surely it's designed in a way to force you to pay to complete the campaign""[/i]

Believe it or not, this is another No. You can complete its lengthy 10 act campaign without spending a single coin in the game. You even can complete it with all the characters and not pay a single dime. And if you don't want to play with other people you aren't forced at any time to do so. The microtransactions are mostly cosmetics, and extra space for the stash isn't really necessary for the campaign. 

Now you probably see the crazy amount of hours of some people in the reviews and think  [i]""Wait I have a life besides this game, is the campaign that long? I have to dedicate my life to the game?"" [/i] Well... here is where it gets complicated.

PoE's campaign can take you around 60+ hours if you clean all the zones, do all the side-quests and hear all the dialogues. It's structured in a way to avoid the classic ""win the game 3 times in Normal, Nightmare and Hell difficulties"" so that here the difficulty escalates as you progress through all the 10 acts. So if you want to play casually just once a week to unwind and kill some monsters it's great! They really nailed how to sidestep the repeated playthroughs of the genre. Kudos to the team.

 [i]""Wait, what about that crazy skill tree? I don't want to read a wiki or a guide, I just want to play!"" [/i]

The gigantic skill tree may be intimidating but you have to think that the game just dumps the (passive) skills of different classes in one screen, that's why it seems daunting. Imagine if Diablo 2 dropped all the skills of the 3 trees of each character in one screen... PoE's skill tree is the result. At first just focus on the path closest to your starting point (varies depending each class). Then, when you are comfortable with the game, you'll start to see other ramifications and possibilities. So feel free to experiment as you level up, try crazy combinations and see if it fits your playstyle, the great thing about it is that you can do some pretty varied builds with it. Active skills are another matter that I can't fit here due to the max char count of steam reviews.

 [i]""Ok, yes, but you have 400+ hours what did you do after winning the campaign?"" [/i]

Here is where PoE gets problematic...
I played the [b]Atlas of Worlds[/b], PoE's [b]Endgame[/b]. Which is basically a gigantic map with something like 150 levels connected between them. What I like about it's that it has a clear goal with it's own story related to it. It's not just killing mobs to get better gear, and so on, where you feel like the horse constantly chasing the carrot. Here you have to get better gear to kill the final(s) bosse(s) of the game. Previously, these were two ancient beings that created the Atlas (or something like that) and always appeared from time to time randomly and gave the end game some really interesting backstory. Now, PoE being a Game as Service kind of game, things get changed up. Sadly the Atlas changed and I don't find it as interesting as in the past with the new bosses (Conquerors of the Atlas).  I think it's possible to access the old bosses but it requires doing something special and it's not integrated into the Atlas like the current bosses. But it still retains interesting aspects and mechanics that you should try all the same. It's quite unique.

Another problem with the endgame is that the difficulty escalates quite steeply. And the way you play the campaign becomes almost obsolete. Your build will probably need adjusting. And here is where a lot people go searching for ""popular builds"". This part is up to you. But if you are an old fart like me that doesn't understand where is the fun in copying a build; then the game will get unforgiving and will tire you before you complete the endgame. It becomes a grind the more you progress (I reached tier 10 levels out of 14 or 15 tiers, half the Atlas i.e.). Most people just look up a guide, copy a build from said guide, and even get the items needed for the build trading them with other players, so no looting, just farming currency. Yeah I know, kids these days right? I personally don't get any fun from equipping a player in an ARPG by farming currency and trading instead of earning your loot killing difficult bosses. Or by copying someone else's character. You can play like me and ignore the ""social"" aspect, and without reading any build guides. But the endgame doesn't seem designed for that as I said before since the Atlas becomes quite difficult. You will need hours upon hours to reach a good understanding of the mechanics, it's nice to discover the intricacies of it, but the game may burn you out before you master it. The good part of PoE being a Game as Service is that there is always new content as an excuse for you to go back and try a new character. 

 [i]""I heard there is new content/expansions/leagues all the time, what's that?"" [/i]

A league offers a new mechanic that is present as you play the campaign. This gets integrated with it's own theme and you can get cosmetics by completing it's own set of challenges. If you have something resembling a life and other hobbies you can forget about completing all challenges. You have three months to complete everything before the next leagues comes out and the new mechanic gets incorporated in the standard game. If you want to play at your own pace I recommend trying a league once and then you can continue in the standard game once the league ends. If you want to try different characters, going with a new one with each league isn't a bad idea. But again forget challenges, they are only for the hardcore audience that complete everything in two weeks (probably less). If PoE isn't your only game or hobby after work, then the 3 months space may be too little. 

 [i] ""The story? How is it? Should I listen to the NPCs?"" [/i]

For ARPGs standard, it's good. It has some highs. Some parts I recommend hearing/reading notes are the Labirynth backstory (a dungeon you have to complete without dying to earn points and make a ""Specialization"" for you character) and Daresso's story with the levels in the Colosseum. Also Kitava's story in the last act as you learn it's origin is good. But my favorite is the Labyrinth backstory of why it was created and all the rest that I won't spoil here.

 [i]""Any final advice fellow old-and-not-very-social-player?""  [/i]

[list]
[*]The game economy is based on trading items. No gold. So for this at least, I do recommend a quick check of the wiki for the different ""horadric cube formulas"" so you know what to put in the merchant window to obtain certain currencies. 
[*] If you decide you want to trade the system isn't very intuitive. I once put some items in a premium tab with a fixed price to see how the trading worked. Some months later I logged in PoE's webpage to see I received a PM like two months back. Sorry random stranger!
[*]If you end up hooked by the endgame despite it's problems. For the love of god search an ""item filter"" you'll thank me later.
[/list]

 [i]""You wrote a lot"" [/i]

1063730,New World,"New world a polished turd. Since day one of the games release they have had persistent game breaking bugs, bots, and other exploits that have created an extremely imbalanced in game world. On top of this, they were allowing certain people affiliated as Twitch Partners (Amazon owned) to use these exploits, in turn making them the most powerful players on the game, which lead to their twitch numbers going up, which lead to more money in Amazon's bank account. Recap: Amazon game allows its affiliated Amazon partners to exploit and cheat to increase their revenue. This came at the cost of hundreds of thousands of other players experience. This essentially created a ""Mafia"" landscape across the entire game, and placed their employees as the ""Mob Bosses"" of the families. The game developers constantly claim they are reworking and fixing these bugs, however over the course of the past 5 months the same things continue to break week in and week out. It makes playing the game more of a chore than a hobby. If you like logging in and out of the game every 3 minutes to be able to do things like send a message in chat, or read a quest log, then i guess this is the game for you. I personally cant stand sitting and watching a load screen for 2 minutes just to play for 3 minutes. After over 1500 hours in the game over the course of the past few months, I received a permanent ban for ""cheating"" without any warnings or explanation. I have NEVER cheated in any game. After thoroughly  reviewing the code of conduct (also painstaking and vague)  for the game I sent an appeal email to AGS to ask for details on why/how I got banned for allegedly ""cheating,"" and to request the ban be removed. They responded with an email stating: 

""Hello,

We reviewed the information you provided on appeal and have confirmed that the original disciplinary action was merited in your case. We take instances of Commerce Lock seriously as it is harmful to the community and violates the following section of our Code of Conduct (https://www.amazon.com/help/ags/coc):

As a result, your Lost Ark account remains permanently banned

We can’t share any further information about our decision, and we won’t reply to further emails about this issue.

Amazon Games,

Best regards,
Marlon R.
Amazon Game Studios""

This is clearly an automated response, and it is for Lost Ark, a game in which I do not even play.

Furthermore, this ban happened to my account within a few days of the supposed ""biggest bug fix ever"" (alleging over 1000 bug fixes in the game). The latest patch not only didn't fix the bugs, but created many more. So many more bugs in fact, the developers were for the second or third time forced to shut down all trading in game (the one and only way of acquiring thousands of items without spending the impossible tens of thousands of hours it would take to get RNG based content.) So here we have game developers that are claiming that they are doing certain things to improve the players experience and quality of life in the game, and not following through. At the same time we, the faithful loyal customers of this broken game, who put our trust in the words of the people we pay our money to play this game, who sit and wait for our loyalty to be rewarded, are BANNED without explanation. When asking for details, receiving an automated response for an entirely different game

In summation, don't waste your time or money on this broken game. It has been broken since the day it came out and they apparently do not have a skilled enough development team to fix the issues and clearly do not have a quality assurance team to make sure the same bugs don't pop up every time they put out a patch. Amazon is the biggest company in the world and they do not care about anything besides their bank. As a loyal customer of Amazon for over 11 years, my mind is blown that all of my inquiries were answered by a single automated response from/for the wrong subject. Evidently i can not appeal this again, and i am left to share this terribly bad experience with you all here, and hope it can save someone else 1500 hours of their life, and their hard earned money.

1551360,Forza Horizon 5,"Complicated game to review. For context, I used to play Underground 2, Most Wanted 2005, Burnout 3, Burnout Paradise, Midnight Club 3, and a little bit of Pro Street, Test Drive, Blur and some rally games.

At its core, FH5 has a good sandbox. There is a wide variety of cars ranging from supercars, tuners, muscle cars, offroad vehicles, and pretty much everything in between. The customization is good too - you can modify tiny little details about each car or download other people's creations and use those if you want to skip to proven results without much effort.

The world available has almost every location type you could want in a racing game, however one key thing is missing - a metropolis area, or some sort of street/city scene. There's a very small town and the streets are way too narrow for high-speed racing, so that particular flavor of racing is frankly completely missing in this game. Otherwise the game offers plenty to enjoy, and because of a wide variety of different cars, tuning options, and adjustable difficulty settings, you can effectively move the slider between casual racing and simulation to lean towards one or the other.

Then there's the online mode, which is a big let-down because of several core issues. The game has a very muted social aspect, lacking things to do together, and limiting player to player interaction. First of all, there's a lack of central hubs in the game, you mainly only find people at the starting area, with nothing interesting nearby. Because of that, people just drive around a bit and leave, you don't form groups to go do other things.

You only see players who are near you, if you get distance between yourself and another player, they disappear from your map, you can easily lose a friend you could have made, and overall you never know if a place you're driving to has 10 other players there or absolutely none. This was never an issue in other games, you could see where everyone is, and most players would go to places where they saw other people.

Other players are ghosts by default, you can't interact with them and you don't feel like you are sharing the same space with them. This has been very jarring. I can see other players around me, but it still feels like playing alone. I've never experienced that in other games, and it's just really sad. I have fond memories of hanging out with other players in Burnout, doing stunts together, racing, playing cops and robbers, crashing into players, I often stayed in the same servers with the same people for hours on end.

In FH5 you don't feel any kind of server unity, you feel completely disconnected. Even if you find a convoy with other players (which then disables the ghost mode for people within the convoy), it still doesn't feel the same, because ghosts by default means everyone in the playerbase has a different mentality, almost like they have no idea what to do.

You can honk at someone and drive off hoping they'd follow, and they're not going to, because they're used to everyone being a ghost they can ignore. This is in contrast to other games where a honk-and-run leads to people following you 99% of the time, and it felt like a secret code, if you honk at someone you've made a new friend.

Lastly, in many other games like this, you'd have a wide variety of challenges to complete, which directed players towards certain areas, got them together and gave them things to do. FH5 doesn't have that. Horizon Arcade exists, but you need to wait in a small circle 5-15 minutes, which nobody is going to do. You could vote-start stuff like this in Burnout Paradise, they did it better over a decade ago.

So all in all, this game is complicated to review. If you just want to kick back and listen to music while exploring a beautiful world with fast cars, FH5 does scratch that itch, and there's plenty of story content to keep you busy. But if you're looking for a fun and varied multiplayer component - you're going to be disappointed, because you won't find that here.

I'm giving it a thumbs up regardless because even though it's not what I was looking for, it's definitely not a bad game and I have enjoyed my time with it.",complicated game review context used play underground 2 wanted 2005 burnout 3 burnout paradise midnight club 3 little bit pro street test drive blur rally game core fh5 good sandbox wide variety car ranging supercars tuner muscle car offroad vehicle pretty much everything customization good modify tiny little detail car download people creation use want skip proven result without much effort world available almost every location type could want racing game however one key thing missing metropolis area sort street city scene small town street way narrow high speed racing particular flavor racing frankly completely missing game otherwise game offer plenty enjoy wide variety different car tuning option adjustable difficulty setting effectively move slider casual racing simulation lean towards one online mode big let several core issue game muted social aspect lacking thing together limiting player player interaction first lack central hub game mainly find people starting area nothing interesting nearby people drive around bit leave form group go thing see player near get distance another player disappear map easily lose friend could made overall never know place driving 10 player absolutely none never issue game could see everyone player would go place saw people player ghost default interact feel like sharing space jarring see player around still feel like playing alone never experienced game really sad fond memory hanging player burnout stunt together racing playing cop robber crashing player often stayed server people hour end fh5 feel kind server unity feel completely disconnected even find convoy player disables ghost mode people within convoy still feel ghost default mean everyone playerbase different mentality almost like idea honk someone drive hoping follow going used everyone ghost ignore contrast game honk run lead people following 99 time felt like secret code honk someone made new friend lastly many game like wide variety challenge complete directed player towards certain area got together gave thing fh5 horizon arcade exists need wait small circle 5 15 minute nobody going could vote start stuff like burnout paradise better decade ago game complicated review want kick back listen music exploring beautiful world fast car fh5 scratch itch plenty story content keep busy looking fun varied multiplayer component going disappointed find giving thumb regardless even though looking definitely bad game enjoyed time

I have never used any third party software to cheat. I have never cheated or manipulated the game in any way. I have done nothing against the code of conduct that I agreed to.

I tried to contact Bethesda or ZeniMax Media support. I found that there is no phone number to call. There is no online chat. There is no support forum. The only way to contact them is through email, which they only respond to about once a day.

I found that the only way to contest the ban was to submit a ticket to customer service.

When I tried to log on to my Bethesda account, It would not accept my password. I clicked on the “I forgot my password” link, which did nothing. I was not able to reset my password until the next day.

When I finally got into my account I tried to submit a ticket to customer service to dispute the false accusation of cheating. I used the drop-down menu to choose “My account was hacked or suspended” for the subject field. I had to fill out an online form that had required fields. Many of the drop-down menus that I had to choose from did not fit the problem I was having and there was no way to choose other options. One of the required fields was “date of account creation” which I did not remember. The form would not submit until I filled out the required field. I had to put in information I know was not right just to submit the ticket. I put in the comment field that the date of account creation was wrong because I could not remember when it was created.

I was frustrated and confused. Why would Bethesda accuse me of cheating when I had done nothing of the sort? I have been a huge Bethesda fan for years. I played Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and now Fallout 76.

I waited patiently for Bethesda to resolve the problem that was obviously an error. I was sure that they would see the error and reinstate my Fallout 76 account.

The first response I received from Bethesda support was an email telling me how to log on to my Bethesda account to find the date of account creation. This was the only thing in the ticket that they saw. They did not read the subject which said “My account was hacked or suspended”. I followed the instructions that they gave. It did not lead to information of when my account was created.

I responded by saying that my problem was not that I could not remember when my account was created but that it was hacked or suspended.

The second response from Bethesda support was a question asking me if there was another email I use because they said my email address on file was not associated with a suspended account.

At this point I thought they were joking. I asked as much. There is clearly a ticket on my account that says “Account permanently suspended for cheating.” I gave them the ticket number. I pasted in a copy of the email they sent me saying my account was closed for cheating. I also included a screen shot of me trying to log into my Fallout 76 account and getting a message that says “Account not verified”.

It is like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

Finally, I received an email stating the following.

“After a thorough review of your account, it has been determined that the account did in fact violate our Code of Conduct.  We regret to inform you that your appeal for an account ban reversal is denied due to the evidence within our system for Cheating / Exploitation enabled via a third-party program.   This account is no longer eligible to participate in Fallout 76 due to the offenses on this account.
 
Due to the extent and scale of the violation, it has been decided that this account will remain  ineligible to participate in Fallout 76 permanently. This decision was not made lightly, and it is final.”

I maintain that I have never cheated. They never gave me a chance to defend myself. They never provided the evidence that I cheated. It seems as if they don't care if I am innocent or not.

All I want to do is tell my story and find if there are other people who have been banned by Bethesda for no reason.

A couple areas where it falls short of real hunting:
1  Wind.  In real life the wind isn't ALWAYS blowing.  In this game, it blows 24-7.  And it'll be south one minute and then North 5 minutes later, ruining your entire plan of attack.   Generally, in real life in the Northern Hemisphere, wind blows west to east, with small variance.  Devs went full potato with the wind.

2  Animal intelligence.  They all have the same AI.  In real life though, certain animals are smarter than others.  Elk are dumb as hell in real life.  But in this game they're just as skittish as whitetail and rabbits which is just stupid.

3 Camouflage.  In real life, camouflage matters.  Blending in with the environment matters.  In this game it doesn't matter AT ALL.  How you F this up when you're trying to create a hunting simulator is beyond me.

548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"I have played this game for a long while with friends and enjoyed every moment of it.

My wife, who is new to gaming and generally does not play any type of FPS saw us playing this and was curious about it, so I decided to gift it to her on steam to see if she would enjoy it. I fully expected her to play it for about one or two missions and lose interest, as she generally does not have the knack for playing games that require focus and she doesn't enjoy games that have a gathering aspect.

She chose Gunner, loaded into the game and proceeded to unleash hell on bugs, and on our entire team in the process. While she doesn't understand what's going on most of the time, she loves shooting the bugs and always gets excited when Mission Control yells ""SWARM! It's a big one team!"" laughing maniacally as she lobs sticky grenades all over the place. I have made sure that she unlocked the friendly fire perk to try and mitigate the damage she does to her teammates.

I have always found this game to be incredibly fun, but now, with my wife in the game, it's hilarious. It's heartwarming to see her enjoying herself and having her come home from work and look at me and ask ""space dwarves after dinner?""

281990,Stellaris,"I decided that my first Stellaris playthough would be on Ironman mode, with no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever. What follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years.

Background:
I named my empire ""The Galactic Empire"" and began the game as a militarist, materialist, and authoritarian.

The Celimy Conflict:
Early on, around the 50 year mark, I encounter a species of strange, fungal creatures. They call themselves the ""Celimy States"". They are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists. Fools.
After a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry, the Celimy declare war on me.
My navy, christened the ""Grand Imperial Navy"", departs the Coruscant System to engage the Celimy ""Mycelium Carriers"", as they called themselves.
A short time later, the Imperial Navy reaches the Celimy home system. 
Imperial transports land armies on their capital.
The takeover is rapid, and at the end of the war the Celimy States has splintered into 3 separate nations: The Celimy Hegemony, the Celimy Confederacy and the Celimy Associates. 
Later on, the Associates would become my vassal. The Confederacy was a long standing enemy.

The Galactic Civil War:
Around 120 years in, the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires, and two distinct sides begin to form.
On one side is myself and a federation called the ""Stellar Entente"", along with various other small empires.
The other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations, led by the ""Karabnar Nations"".
War breaks out, with the Karabnar declaring war on the Galactic Empire.
I now have 3 fleets: The Star Corps, the Shock Battalion, and the Grand Imperial Navy. The Star Corps and Shock Battalion are relatively small shock forces, whereas the Grand Imperial Navy is my main force.
A massive space battle in the Ocheron system involves over 1000 ships, with almost every known nation being present.
The battle (which was beautiful to watch) was relatively even until the arrival of the Star Corps and Shock Battalion, who tipped the balance with fresh ships.
The combined fleet of myself and my allies (yes, the AI is THAT good) eventually reaches Karab, the Karabnar Nations capital, and takes the system with the help of two Titanic Beasts recruited from the outer systems of the Empire.
On the verge of victory, I am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over Coruscant. 
Sent by the Hjaarthi Syndicate, one of our enemies, the fleet is in position to take our homeworld. 
My own fleets cannot reach Coruscant in time. All seems lost.
A mere few days before Coruscant's fortifications would've failed, a fleet from one of my allies, the Verulian Compact, comes out of hyperspace above Coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet.
The Karabnar Nation and their allies surrender, and the war is won.

The Fallen Empire (150 years in):
A fallen empire (which is a fully developed but stagnant state) exists above me. They call themselves the Yz'Vorak Remnant (which I shortened to Y Remnant).
They are military isolationists, and hate my empire with a special intensity.
They insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire. This sort of war is usually a death sentence, so I move large numbers of people away from the Frontier and prepare to submit.
At this point I've got 3 vassals. All are weak, but they are extremely loyal. 
The vassals join me in the war.
All 3 of my fleets meet above Coruscant, along with Transports for my Droid Army (Irony, much)
I deploy my entire military to the Jahab system, where we meet the Fallen Empire's forces.
Their ships are unlike anything we've ever seen, and are incredibly powerful. 
We are losing the battle. Things are not looking good.
Suddenly, out of hyperspace, come 3 fleets; my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort. 
With their help, we drive back the Fallen Empire forces.
Fastforward about 3 years.
Through intense naval strategy and economic strain, Imperial forces have out matched the Y Remnant's fleet. 
The Grand Imperial Navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital: The Core.
I don't have enough strength left to invade their planets, so I offer them a white peace.
Fallen Empires cannot build new fleets, so this seemed logical enough.
I recieve a notification:
""Peace Accords on Coruscant""
While signing the peace accords on Coruscant, two V Remnant agents who were standing next to the Emperor (of the Galactic Empire) killed him and mutilated his body.
Furious, the Imperial Navy and the combined fleets of all of the Empire's vassals and allies immediately attack the Y Remnant Capital.
Out of nowhere, a massive army from the Fallen Empire comes out of hyperspace over The Core (I still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from).
In the epic battle that ensues, the Grand Imperial Navy defeats and destroys the Y Remnant's fleet, allowing the ground invasion of The Core to take place.
With The Core fallen, the Fallen Empire cowers and begs for peace.
The Y Remnant is annexed by the Galactic Empire.
Peace reigns across the galaxy.

Around 20 years later...

Subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before. A new being from out of our dimension makes contact. Their signal is not unlike a hunting call.....


BY POPULAR REQUEST, AN UPDATE:

Their name is the Unbidden and they make an immediate point.
A transmission appears on my screen, depicting some kind of strange, ethereal being.
They say something about prey and then the transmission cuts out.
The Unbidden fleet is marked by science ship in the bottom part of the galaxy, below myself and the ""Qix'Lufran Combine"".
The Qix'Lufran are isolationist authoritarians, but decide to deploy their entire fleet, the sole largest fleet in the galaxy, to immediately engage this extraterrestrial threat.
The Qix'Lufran fleet reaches the Unbidden's position, and is utterly destroyed.
This shocks the entire galaxy.

Interestingly enough, these ""Unbidden"" would remain effectively dormant in their small region at the bottom of the galaxy. Not sure if it was because of the Fallen Empire bordering them, or simply because they were waiting for reinforcements. Either way, the Unbidden hold their position for the time being.

The Great Intergalactic War:

The Galactic Empire has become the most powerful and largest state in the galaxy. Above us, the ""Hjannarthi Syndicate"" exists, which nearly equals my own power. To our left is the ""Stellar Entente"" federation. To the right is the Njalax High Kingdom, and the Uriy Republic. Below us, the Zuifvan Imperium, the Qix'Lufran, and the Unbidden.
Although there is a period of peace, there is great unrest in the galaxy.
The Qix'Lufran and Njalax grow closer and closer every year.
Eventually, they declare a defensive pact and close their borders to myself, the Stellar Entente and the Hjannarthi Syndicate.
Their combined power rivals my own; they are dangerous.
They undergo a combined massive military buildup, and begin to become increasingly aggressive.
In mid july of 2412 (212 years in) the tensions boil over. The Njalax and the Qix'Lufran declare war on the Galactic Empire, the Hjannarthi, and the Stellar Entente. 
The galaxy is divided.
A line is drawn essentially down the middle of the galaxy, dividing the left(Qix'Lufran and Njalax) from the right(Galactic Empire and Allies).
I issue an immediate order to deploy the fleet. The long dormant Grand Imperial Navy assembles over Coruscant.
Admiral Cognat leads the navy.
My ever-reliable vassals send everything they have to join the Imperial Navy. I love those guys.
The Stellar Entente's federation fleet strikes first. They use their wormhole stations to attack directly at the heart of the Njalax.
My own fleet reaches the Qix'Lufran capital with relative ease, meeting almost no resistance.
We confront a vastly outmatched Qix'Lufran force of 2 battleships and 18 corvettes.

5000 hours played, and just got my Pen blackstar. What's not to recommend?

Here's the thing. This game is a beautiful exercise in game design. Virtually everything, from the economy through to the relative silver rates for crafting, grinding, and everything except hunting, is mathematically-balanced to a genius level degree. The world, quests, and classes have an amazing degree of depth.

The reason I don't recommend? The exploitation of your psychology is also perfectly designed. From the first time you get ganked and swear to yourself 'I'll get my revenge once I gear up', through to the constant shower of micro-rewards; need to login 24/7; gambling-based enhancement; and exponential sunk-cost, this is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit card.

It's not a bad experience subjectively; a lab rat will always look forward to it's next morsel as it runs through the maze. But it is a ruthless exemplar of how to manipulate players. A bit like I'd say drugs are probably fun but I wouldn't recommend them, I think the same applies to this game. And much like drugs, you'll probably do better if you don't try them in the first place.",5000 hour played got pen blackstar recommend thing game beautiful exercise game design virtually everything economy relative silver rate crafting grinding everything except hunting mathematically balanced genius level degree world quest class amazing degree depth reason recommend exploitation psychology also perfectly designed first time get ganked swear get revenge gear constant shower micro reward need login 24 7 gambling based enhancement exponential sunk cost game designed exploit every weakness take credit card bad experience subjectively lab rat always look forward next morsel run maze ruthless exemplar manipulate player bit like say drug probably fun recommend think applies game much like drug probably better try first place

""No sweetie, we have Bloodborne at home.""

You shake your head, but soon realize mom is on to something.

Round8 takes a more straightforward approach to story telling than FromSoftware, but is able to convey a fairly captivating narrative with a twist on the tale of Pinocchio where lying won't make you a good boy, but is nevertheless proof of your humanity and empathy. 

LoP's boss fights are one of the highlights, and show that it understands what one of the most important elements in a souls-like game is: patterns and movesets. Bosses have many unique attacks and animations, often with long wind ups (some might say a lesson it shouldn't have learned from recent FromSoftware games) that require the player's full attention and pinpoint reaction to be defeated, with a major focus on perfect guards to stagger and destroy enemies' weapons. 

Adding to this is a weapon system that allows you to dismantle and combine blades and handles to create your own moves, making you able for instance to create a dagger with the moveset and the scaling of a mace weapon.

Exploration itself is fairly linear, with usually only a single main location the player can go, but every area is sufficiently interesting to go through, offering the usual shortcuts and amount of nooks and crannies to discover, but is perhaps generally not as strong as From's best.

Nonetheless, south korean Round8 came out of nowhere with what is very likely the best non-From souls-like in the market, right next to Nioh, while resembling the source material more closely than Team Ninja's title. An all-around impressive effort, and one that I can't wait to see more of.",mom bloodborne sweetie bloodborne home shake head soon realize mom something round8 take straightforward approach story telling fromsoftware able convey fairly captivating narrative twist tale pinocchio lying make good boy nevertheless proof humanity empathy lop bos fight one highlight show understands one important element soul like game pattern movesets boss many unique attack animation often long wind ups might say lesson learned recent fromsoftware game require player full attention pinpoint reaction defeated major focus perfect guard stagger destroy enemy weapon adding weapon system allows dismantle combine blade handle create move making able instance create dagger moveset scaling mace weapon exploration fairly linear usually single main location player go every area sufficiently interesting go offering usual shortcut amount nook cranny discover perhaps generally strong best nonetheless south korean round8 came nowhere likely best non soul like market right next nioh resembling source material closely team ninja title around impressive effort one wait see

230410,Warframe,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
2020 RE-review... My thoughts have not changed, this game remains top of the looter shooter genre, with beautiful graphics (finally got a good PC lmao), lots of customization and lots of characters. You'll probably find the frame for you very quickly! I have never played a game that was so perfect in regards to how it treats the customer. I have more below, but just know in recent years so much story, game and UI improvements have been dealt!

[h1] Intro [/h1]
Warframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. 

[h1] Warframe Pros [/h1]

Warframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I've been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!

This game has thousands of mods. Unlike its 'comparable' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.Even the placement of mods will determine their effectiveness!

This game allows for player to player trading. Whether you're looking for 'prime' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.

The UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, we've recently gotten our third open world. Completely. Free.

The memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It's crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards. Specifically the Second Dream touched my soul. I have played for 6 years or so and after all that time, to see the truth... I can't explain the feeling. I saved up and purchased the pre-order for the Second Dream's statue bundle to commemorate!

Your Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone.. SOMEONE! For the longest time, in the game, I was closest to my dear space mom. The Lotus!

The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, I know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up ""This is What You Are - Keith"" <- It'll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..

[h1] Warframe Cons [/h1]

The grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren't patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.

The lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you'll have to look it up on YouTube. If you'd like a good series I recommend StallorD

The enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  

[h1] Improvements? [/h1]
[i] These are simply opinions on minor things... [/i]

Dojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I'm talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you'll have special things that show your true power, and riches!

On 'Finisher' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!

Please add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don't know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!

[h1] Final Words [/h1]

Now please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe! If you have any questions, need help in game, a clan to join, or notice anything spelled wrong, or anything I should add.. please feel free to drop a comment in the space below!

236390,War Thunder,"Okay listen.

I've got 2,222 hours in this game while I'm writing this. I get that it's confusing that I'm making a negative review.

Tl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I've ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.

All I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:

-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you'll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here's the... well... ""but"". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you're free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn't a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a ""level"" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you'll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won't be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you're fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there's always a long winded explanation that boils down to ""balance"") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you're golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you'll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it's so expensive you either can't buy it, or can but then can't play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. 

So the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn't technically pay-to-play. It's more like ""pay-to-easily-play-high-tier"". You're not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don't have silver lions, you're out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It's awful.

So, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It's not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don't know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They're objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It's not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I'm not strictly against this but there's already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it's two clashing playstyles that shouldn't ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.

Premium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it's a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you'll likely be fairly experienced.

Convertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it's technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don't feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. 

Gaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It's just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can't turn back into ""real"" money. There's skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it's not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn't on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.

There's also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).

Basically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.",okay listen got 2 222 hour game writing get confusing making negative review tl dr good game one worst scummy product ever seen one prey people addictive personality wide spectrum way really need explain monetization tbh silver lion silver lion non premium currency war thunder achieved passively played playing well give nice bonus winning match massively multiplies silver lion gain ie kill 1 person match lose plane mode get small amount silver lion even one kill match win worth fair amount degree get better better play well silver lion precisely designed first start playing game matter ie whether completely free play premium vehicle premium vehicle premium account getting enough silver lion cover silver lion cost vehicle access low tier vehicle cost basically nothing repair almost premium premium account vehicle massively boost silver lion income using might seeing problem already stick progress game free play first quickly unlock cheap vehicle reaching expensive one thing slower slower unlock expensive clear far big deal issue come reach 7 0 battle rating basically level matchmaking balance ground force 8 0 air force experience point vehicle sluggish unlock extremely expensive buying training crew slot play every modification cost sl also repairing rearming aircraft battle lower tier might even notice 6 0 almost certainly notice unless play poorly major issue might take easy right buying newly unlocked vehicle fine beyond certain vehicle seemingly arbitrarily though always long winded explanation boil balance cost bafflingly ridiculously hilariously high amount silver lion 2 3 million silver lion lower tier golden lose rough match fine higher tier could burn day unlucky half time unlock new jet main battle tank expensive either buy play die getting kill lose massive amount question vehicle game punished playing game designed way progress grinding hundred hour rewarded literally unable play rough match well sorta brings u next monetization basically buy silver lion real money run pay full transparency technically pay play like pay easily play high tier locked playing game really want play high tier modern stuff silver lion luck unless amazing match certain vehicle like b 29 tu 4 long range bomber high repair cost low survival rate essentially useless gaijin balance almost exclusively sl cost awful next golden eagle premium currency nothing new every f2p game pretty much something would review game negative normally golden eagle small piece puzzle used buy majority premium vehicle game well silver lion premium account time decal decoration ect premium vehicle often unbalanced launch get balanced overtime know intentional 6 dominated year gaijin toned lot still better others objectively pay win clearly pay progress biggest issue new player pay price full aaa game high tier vehicle without learning use game loosely designed way progress learn skill need progress super linear naturally happens fairly well buy highest tier stuff limitation skip grind yes also skip learning lead lot inexperienced player high tier often teamkill ram block capture point steal otherwise ruin game dedicated part playerbase clear strictly already little incentive team play game new player high tier premium never actually gon na put time learn play like experienced player fine two clashing playstyles ever really meet jet main battle tank theory depth highest skill ceiling game mix map design mechanic aforementioned premium issue actually least depth aside lowest tier devolve head ramming head charge premium account much say normal f2p game top everything everything lot basically make get research silver lion progress faster run lion slower effect player way since even premium account unless buy high tier premium time get high tier likely fairly experienced convertible research one scummiest basically pay golden eagle real money speed skip research vehicle one purely prays frustrated people thinking clearly fed grind game full brim grind literally endless grind never achieve everything without paying huge sum real money game love tempt fact technically possible add next thing add new vehicle every update le never ever ever use convertible research unless golden eagle laying around bit research feel like even make economic sense get premium vehicle account waste money use eagle gaijincoin war thunder market think c go dota tf2 marketplace turn money even faker money turn back real money skin non premium exclusive vehicle marketplace almost event vehicle required immense grind get outright overpowered like kv 220 thus go hundred hundred dollar lot cheap skin great though portion money go artist worst thing ever get stuff free easily big deal keep mind one game also battlepass like dota overwatch smite ect basically every element game designed squeeze money
569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"Long and short:

The Short:
Simple without being patronizing, with a good ramp, room to correct mistakes, charming style, and great little score.
Well worth the money at full price.

The long:
It has an almost Black and White feel to it with a heavier emphasis on the Sim City aspects, but not too much. Very chill and relaxed vibe but things can get hairy when ogres start showing up. There is a kind of natural ramp that gets you extending your borders in search of the resources and balancing plates for gold, stone, and wood, with some extras that build on those economies giving better buildings more of an investment weight. It’s not going to have you micromanaging exact numbers of workers for each resource and instead opts for a more general management approach that sits comfortably in that warm fuzzy area between macro and micro management.
The fact that there is still more promised and seem to be pretty regular feed updates on the Dev’s social media is also a big plus.
At 10 bucks, you can’t beat it.

221100,DayZ,"I was looting the barracks in Zelenogorsk when I hear a gate being opened behind me, I turn and see a well-equipped player dealing with a zombie. I have a gun in hands and the advantage, but my entire current playthrough has been rather peaceful, so i opt for a non-violent solution. I duck behind the corner of a barrack and yell over direct chat that I don't want to kill him, and i circle around a stone wall trying to avoid line of sight. He answers, but it is intangible. I can't see him anywhere but I assume he went to the barracks. (1st person server btw) I try my best to not get in an awkward position and run up into the second floor of a house overlooking the military site. By the time I get there i can see that he has indeed closed the door in the prison building.

The reason i was looting military sites was to find some AK74 mags. That was my entire reason for being there. I'd trade my M4 for a couple of those. I think about the chances of being killed versus the chance of him might having such a mag for trade. I know it's risky, but ♥♥♥♥ it. I run up to the prison building and say I'm friendly and just wondered if we could do some trade.

He accepts and tells me to come into the prison with my gun put away. This smells rotten eggs all the way to Rify, but I'm determined that my friendly intentions will serve me well.I enter, he is pointing at the door with an AUG. It's when i get closer to him that i see a second man with an AUG in the staircase. I explain what I'm trying to get and mid-sentence, a friend of theirs come in. He was likely watching the entrance. After a little meet&greet the say 'sorry, don't have any mags'. I say that's okay, and we agree that we wont go the same direction afterwards lest we run into each other again.

I drop a black skull balaclava that i wasn't using as a token of gratitude for the friendly encounter and I'm on my way to Mishynko. Half way there, somewhere in the forest, I'm shot in the leg. Pants ruined, but legs not broken. I very briefly get some vietnam-level flashbacks to the time my roommate taught me the basics of ARMA and combat, and I jump behind a tree instead of just turning around. I count down from 10 and regain my breath. My M4 is equiped with an ACOG, and the shooter must have been about 100-150 meters away.

I peek from the tree and see a man getting down on the ground by a bush. There's no peaceful solution to this conflict. My breath has gone down and I brace myself. peaking a second time with my rifle and shoot three rounds.

One of them hit.

I wait 4 seconds for him to likely have gotten behind a tree of his own to bandage. I start making a wide arch around him, moving as quickly and safely i can while preserving breath. I finally get to him and see he's unconscious.

That's when i noticed it was the third guy from before, donning a black skull balaclava. I'm angry, but not disappointed. this is the nature of the game. While i still have him alive and able to hear me, all i can get myself to yell was ""I TRUSTED YOU"" before I shot him. Looting his body, I find 3 ak74 mags, an ammo box full of the right ammo, an LRS and some decent stores of food.

899770,Last Epoch,"So I bought this for myself last week as an avid ARPG enthusiast with well over 2000 hours on Path of Exile and god knows how long on D2 back in the day, I blink, and 50 hours have passed. This game shows phenomenal promise, the devs are super active and pumping out content and fixes at a rapid rate and have been faithfully following the roadmap plan.

Last Epoch is far easier to get into than PoE, with a much more approachable passive and active skill system. Every weapon type can be used by every class which allows for some juicy build diversity, there's plenty of synergy between skills and passives and all upgrade points feel rewarding with a satisfying bump in power. 

Let's go over some pro's:

- Tons and tons of character customisation, got all the basic equipment, rings, belts, amulets and idols, a neat item that provide powerful buffs to stats. A 4x4 grid is provided to arrange idols in whatever way you want, with smaller idols providing smaller or more generic buffs such as flat health or a small % increase to fire damage, and larger idols providing big specific buffs such as % lightning damage but the value is doubled if you have over 300 max mana. These idols allow for a lot of extra customisation. 
- Enjoyable story campaign with good voice acting on top, granted the story isn't fully completed yet but I had fun! Time travel, cosmic horror, many biomes and environments, immortal emperors and imperious gods! What's not to like?
- Telegraphed enemy attacks!!! Words cannot describe how gratifying it is to see where the massive void bomb thrown at you is actually going to land, allowing you to dodge or time your defensive abilities accordingly. And if/when you do die, there's a death screen showing you what attack you died to and what damage type/s that attack dealt.
- An approachable deterministic crafting system is something PoE has been crying out for, and thankfully LE provides. Yes it does still require some luck, but basically how it works is thus; you find affix shards all over the place as a lootable ground item which provide a single use ""craft"" to forge onto an item or to improve an existing roll. Every possible affix can drop as a shard, or you can shatter an item with an affix you want to apply to another item and get a random amount of shards back from all the affixes on the shattered item. It's easy to play around with, and shards fly out of mobs and barrels so there's plenty to experiment with! The highest tier rolls (T7) are drop only, with item forging allowing a maximum affix tier of 5 so you can't fully power a basic roll therefore keeping loot valuable late-game. Fracturing an item prevents it from being modified anymore, and can even lower your affix tiers so it's basically a game of chicken if you want to upgrade your item more and more.
- The Monolith of Fate is a solid endgame grind, allowing you to unlock permanent character upgrades upon completing the mini quest lines contained with each Monolith stage. Endless Arena keys can drop from the Monolith loot chest allowing you to challenge the appropriately named Endless Arena against waves of mobs providing a good chunk of xp.
- Advanced affix descriptions provide a description of an affix, for example ""chance to inflict shock"" is a possible item affix, and if you hold ""alt"" while hovering over the item it will tell you exactly what shock does. All the defensive mechanics show the maths behind them. Basically the game is exceptionally well explained! 
- Level setting, backgrounds and atmosphere are top-notch and the End of Time ""town"" has a freaking black hole in the background which is cool as fuck.

Consequentially there are some cons:

- Gold isn't particularly useful yet, and items aren't worth picking up to sell as you get plenty from it dropping from mobs and breakables. However I imagine when the bazaar is introduced and allows player trading it will become much more useful!
- You can't modify uniques or set items which can be annoying if you get one with low rolls or implicits.
- While the game does run well generally, some skills and enemy attacks do slow the framerate down particularly the big screen size ones that can be used repeatedly. 
- No random terrain generation, as in if you run ""shining cove"" multiple times, the zone layout is the same every time. Personally I don't mind this but it could get a bit same-y doing the same layout over again.

Overall, Last Epoch has incredible potential and is already a super fun ARPG with a good story, great itemisation, satisfying character upgrades through levelling and item upgrades and a great dev team who deserve your support.

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","[h1] ""My dialogue with heretics is usually quite short, with the last word being a bolter discharge.” [/h1]

Warhammer 40.000: Rogue Trader (2023) represents a turn-based roleplaying game (RPG), developed and published by the company Owlcat Games. Further notable titles of the development studio are Pathfinder: Kingmaker (2018) and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (2021); both prior instalments were RPGs based on real-time with pause (RTWP) gameplay.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ You could play as a lackey blinded by the imperial doctrine. Or, you let the whispers of an ancient blade flood your mind, replacing your thoughts with a singular urge. To rule them all. Let the benefactor from the warp guide you on your ascension to ultimate dominance. Give in to your heretical ambitions, and support the ruinous powers wherever possible. A planet left to the incursion of chaos, the sacrifice of gullible allies who have outlived their purpose, every deed and gift in their name is welcomed by the dark gods. Serve them faithfully and in return they will grant you powers beyond your mortal boundaries!

++ The faithful visualization of the WH40K lore in combination with a well maintained balance between characterization, combat and mini-games make for an immersive RPG experience. The alignment system, based on dogmatic, iconoclast or heretical decisions, increases the replay value. Most side quests allow for multiple solutions and rely on character alignment or skill checks. A massive skill tree broadens the tactical depth, and provides the basis for unsanctified MIN/MAX builds.

+ The first implementation of a co-op multiplayer within an Owlcat game can be described as successful. Several sessions with my siblings / battle brothers, purging heretics and xenos alike with bolters, flamers and melta guns, bear witness to this.

o I would like the following for the successor AKA Rogue Trader 2: A companion from the Officio Assassinorum that must be kept in stasis, while not on the field, otherwise he will massacre your ship crew in a drug induced rampage. Classic invasion by tyranid forces foreshadowed by a genestealer incident. Good old ork raiding party featuring my favourite boyz from the Deathskullz clan with tons of dakka. And one hell of a boss fight against a tainted dreadnought, preferably Mhara Gal origin; I still owe one of them a meltashot to the visor.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. area attacks are sometimes not registered, differences in height are not calculated correctly, and some co-op sessions are prematurely terminated. Owlcat’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

[i] Summary: [/i]

Due to the complex and long history of the WH40K fandom, spanning several decades, I would like to acknowledge the discipline and effort put into this project to successfully apply such intimidating source material.

For newcomers to the franchise, the game provides an excellent cross-section of the grim, dark future within the Imperium of Man. As a fan, with over 60 books in my personal black library, it feels like finding a long forgotten STC with schematics for pre-30K armaments.

Recommended for determined recruits and seasoned veterans, loyal to the Palatine Aquila, seeking a faithful adaptation of the sacred lore of the God-Emperor of Mankind. And remember inquisitor, innocence proves nothing!

[quote=TalePlay][i]Please note that the numbers above are based on the website howlongtobeat.com and does not guarantee that you'll get the same hours invested in the game. Some players may finish this game faster and some may take longer.[/i][/quote]

This review is based on a couple of hours of gameplay and I'm addressing to people willing to buy this game so they can make an informative decision if they want to buy this game or not. In this current state of the game, it is playable, but it's having some technical flaws, which I will be addressing below.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

Dying Light 2 improves on its predecessor, with new areas to explore, new characters, and new things to do. As it's an early review, I will update you shortly on what new things have been added. Each help you provide offers you the possibility to influence the city and shape it in ways that it serves you in your missions and survivability. There are new parkour moves and the game feels a lot more fluent than Dying Light felt.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

I had a lot of fun in the first and this ramps up the fun by a lot. Combat feels more difficult as the AI is a lot more responsibe during it, although there's room for improvement. The funnest part is probably the fact that now there's less danger throughout the day as zombies are more indoors than outdoors. During the night, the difficulty level increaese and so it may do the fun. If you'll play co-op you'll have a lot more fun in my opinion as you can rely on your partner. 

[h3] 🏞 Graphics: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

Although my system doesn't support High or Ultra graphics, this game looks stunning. I'm playing on Low settings because my GTX 1060 can't support any higher and I am not having the best performance in frames. My game runs 30-40 FPS, but it is playable without an issue once your eyes adjust. If you have a beefier GPU, you can ramp up the graphics to it's finest. RTX is an amazing system here and improves the quality of your games drastically. If you can run this game to a decent FPS, you'll have a good treat.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

There are more improvements made in how the game sounds and feels. Your weapons sound a lot more authentic. Additional rings on your blade actually cling together making it feel like a heavy blade hits the zombie or object. Good music throughout chases and it really ramps up the thrill. I've enjoyed the music from the first, this isn't any worst in my opinion.

[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★☆☆

The game is a lot more polished than the previous one in my opinion. Cinematics feel a lot more epic and the whole direction of the game will intrigue right off the bat. I got hooked in the game in the first 4-6 hours right away without even noticing the time. Aiden, the new character sounds a lot like the previous voice actor, that voiced Crane. I loved that about it as the protagonist feels good and it's quite expressive throughout the early stages of the campaign. What I can tell is that your adventure is determined by your sister and Aiden is pretty much focused on doing that. I can't go further into details and I don't want to because the game is new and spoilers kill the fun, but I pretty much like it and I'm excited to see what's going to happen next.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3]

🔲 Short
🔲 Average
☑️ Long 
🔲 Unlimited

Like the first one, this game you will take you a while to finish. If you follow just the narative, you may take about 24 hours to complete, if not more. I think this game should take you roughly 60-100 hours to reach completionism.

[h3] 💷 Price: [/h3]

🔲 Free
🔲 Underpriced
🔲 Perfect Price
☑️ Could be cheaper
🔲 Overpriced

Obviously the game came just came out so the price is a little bit much, but if you can afford it, I promise you that you'll enjoy the game a lot. If you're willing to wait, you may need some time as I don't believe there's going to be a discount anytime soon.

[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3]

🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
☑️ Hard
🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)

In my opinion difficulty kinda increased and I feel like the 1 to 1 combat takes a lot more time because the enemies you encounters block, counter you and it's a bit more difficult to keep track of your health. It's a bit too small and if you don't pay attention you'll get yourself killed a lot more easily in the early stages of the game. As you improve yourself, you'll notice that you'll get better, and gear makes a difference.

[h3] ⚖ Pros & Cons: [/h3]

[h3] ➕ Pros: [/h3]
+ Parkour is a lot better improved in this game than the previous one and feels more fluent and flashy.
+ Combat is more interesting.
+ This game knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and still make you feel overpowered later on, which is great because you can feel progression through itemization.
+ I loved the levelling system in the previous one, I love this one just as much. It's fun to see your bar meter increase and you get cool new tricks.
+ This game is a lot better with friends, but you can surely play it solo and still have a lot of fun, but be prepared to have more difficult times in combat.
+ The story seems interesting and you can actually shape the city through your decisions.

[h3] ➖ Cons: [/h3]
- Some technical issues where side quests don't work. Weird glitches throughout the game, but nothing yet that I've been able to identify that breaks the progression of the game.
- Some parkour move sets are now under a levelling system, so you may feel like you're a lot weaker in parkour early on. But that may be a great things as progression is definitely felt.
- Animations feel a bit off and require more work.

[h3] ⚙ Bugs: [/h3]
Rate: ★★☆☆☆

🔲 Never heard of
☑️ Minor bugs & glitches
☑️ Quests not fully functioning, but main quests isn't affected
🔲 Main quests are affected by bugs, but there's fixes around
🔲 Game-breaking bugs

The game has it's flaws, but I believe they will be fixed. Dying Light 1 has been since 2015 and even until the very last day of this game's release, I've seen improvements and added new things in the game for free. I trust they will get fixed, but be aware that they are there.

Important note is that I've discovered today is that when you start the game, the game doesn't show your Continue or any save files. Don't panic. Quit the game and restart it and you'll see your continuation. If the problem persists, report it to the developers. Aside from this, you'll encounter bugs, glitches and quests acting funny. People reported that there's some game breaking ones, so please be aware of it when you decide to purchase and play this game.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3]
Dying Light 2 is a gorgeous game, with some improvements on the gameplay aspect. I love that your clothes actually change how you look and the story in my opinion seems interesting so far. I can warmly recommend it, but do expect some technical issues if you purchase it now or in the near future of this review. A lot can change later on, so I will come up with an update.

If you love Techland and what they did for Dying Light, you can betcha this game will satisfy that need for zombies, parkour, and exploration. If you're prepared to see bugs and glitches every now and then, and have someone to play with, I doubt you'd not enjoy this game.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"[b]If we feel our way into the human secrets of the sick person, the madness also reveals its system, and we recognize in the mental illness merely an exceptional reaction to emotional problems which are not strange to us. -- Carl G. Jung, [i]""The Content of the Psychoses""[/i][/b]

This is going to be one of those reviews that one would have a truckload to say about, yet when it comes to actually saying something, one ends up empty handed. I will try nonetheless. One thing is sure: playing [i]Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice[/i], was both a magnificent and harrowing experience. Ninja Theory, a development studio based on Cambridge, UK - one we may remember from [i]Enslaved: Odyssey to the West[/i] and the latest part of Devil May Cry series, [i]DmC: Devil May Cry[/i] - even though being relatively young in the market, accomplished an exceptional task with this game.

Here, we take on the role of Senua, a Pict warrior, hailing from Northern Scotland. All we know about her at the beginning of the game, is that Senua has lost her lover, Dillion, to a Viking raid and now she must take on a journey to the Nordic underworld: Helheim, to rescue him. The opening cinematic closely follows Senua as she journeys from the banks of Orkney to this supposed entrance to the underworld. A far away, soft and feminine voice starts talking about Senua's tragedy, and her unique, disturbing nature... and only when she hears the voice talking, and turns back towards the camera, directly looking at us, we realize Senua's sense of what is real may not be the reality that we all are aware of.

Okay, here, I'll start about that part which may be considered as spoilers, so be warned. [spoiler]Senua is a young Celtic warrior like no other: she is schizophrenic. This whole game, is much, much more than simply being a game. It is a direct medium designed to present the player the very experience of being schizophrenic. Our heroine will keep hearing voices, experience hallucinations, collect meaning from most trivial of natural occurrences and will go through periods of dire anxiety and paranoia. All that we encounter within the game, is how Senua interprets and experiences the reality, rather than an objective reality. Her journey to the underworld, her battles against the darkness, her combats with various gods, the challenges she continuously and ferociously overcome: are simply metaphors for her battle against the psychosis itself. At the end of the day, what actually happened to Senua is tragically simple: yet how she overcomes it, is a Herculean task nonetheless. [/spoiler]

What is downright marvelous about this game, is the character Senua herself. Melina Juergens, who performed Senua's voice acting and motion capturing throughout the game, presents an astonishing feat of acting. Her mimics, her tone, her gaze, her whole-body language continuously display a typhoon of emotions, practically enforcing you to live Senua's dark, horrific, painful reality. I strongly recommend watching the short documentary on the game after completing it, so you can witness the whole process yourself. Apparently, the developmental team worked with not only history professors for setting authenticity concerning Norse mythology and Celtic culture, yet they also worked with psychiatrists, specialists on psychosis and even psychotic patients themselves for an accurate representation. This whole creative process in no less than being fascinating!

I've already mentioned that the motion capture was used to enact characters. At this point, I also must note the Unreal Engine 4 presents a majestic scene when it comes to display a sense of realism. Textures, lights, colors and animations are no less than being breath-taking. This has been one VR worthy experience. I sadly lack the equipment, yet if you have a VR device, I strongly recommend trying. Another incredible display quality is the audio atmosphere of the game. [spoiler]As you keep playing, you'll keep hearing various voices, continuously commenting on your mood, your actions, your situation to better simulate paracusia, or auditory hallucinations.[/spoiler] Thus, playing the game with headphones on will hugely benefit to the atmosphere.

Let's talk gameplay at this point, shall we? The game may be categorized as an adventure game with action elements. You will travel through various parts of the said geography and handle endless visual and some auditory puzzles. Every now and then, you will face adversaries in the form of grotesque Viking warriors and even some of their gods. Puzzles are incredibly creative, yet some require an obsessive amount of attention to detail. I loved it since it adds to the atmosphere, yet I agree that it is not everyone’s cup of tea. You just should know what you'll be in for, when you are playing this game. It is a simulation and an experience, enwrapped within a historical setting and a story of tragedy. It is not your casual action-adventure; and it surely isn't the next [i]God of War[/i]. If you are looking for simply a bad-as s game, this is not it. If you are looking for a challenging experience which will test not only your skills, but your own psych: please try it. You won't be disappointed.

At the very beginning of the game, you will be warned that every time you fail, the rot on Senua's body will progress; and if you fail enough times, that would be the end of Senua's journey. [spoiler]This warning immediately started a rumor about a permadeath function about the game. According to the rumor, if you die enough times, your save games will be automatically erased, and you'll have to start over. Now, that is a brilliant hoax. The game says nothing about permadeath. You reach that conclusion based on a false impression yourself. There is no permadeath in the game. Yet, the warning and various following scenes are brilliantly places there to create that kind of assumption to feed into the horror factor. The game literally forces you to share Senua's reality, even though that might not be what is objectively real. I call that simply brilliant. [/spoiler]

At the end of the day, [i]Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice[/i] is a unique yet highly disturbing game, and one you won't soon forget. Please be warned, and try it, if you are willing to appreciate video games as a medium for art and a simulation on the more disturbing side.

236390,War Thunder,"First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.
I am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.

It is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.
After so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy.

There are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:

1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).
Now the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)

2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.

3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.
But I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.


There are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. 

But i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. 
Warthunder ""can""  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.",first playing hour like x2 also played lot houres outside steam rank 100 play faction also good customer gaijin bought lot store year since invested much time money would like give positive review unfortunately decided also decided uninstall game given moment done trust gone beautiful game devs big problem prefer make new content instead fixing old problem many year lost confidence almost never listen criticism fan always think know better forget fan want improve game criticism often treated gaijin enemy many problem long review list important 1 br compression vehicle battlerating like 1 0 1 3 1 7 2 0 ect battlerating indication good vehicle encounter maximum battlerating match 1 higher 1 lower vehicle mean sit highest br lowest br uptier downtier vehicle close together term br compression mean vehicle dominate heavily chance come match gaijin want solve problem want everyone find match quickly biggest problem game 2 gaijin censorship gaijin like criticism post form critical viewed enough player disappear gaijin denies example possible cheat game youtuber proved possible gaijin wanted copyright strike person put realistich game mode arcade kind punishment player something idea gaijin behaved rather childish 3 reporting bug year reported bug found gaijin send replay information 1000kg bomb damage tank shot disappeared air plane shot 1 2 keep flying smoothly seen everything year fortunately never many bug good never received answer gaijin thing done report get closed completely ignored longer found disappears look like gaijin see burden instead help many problem game tank shot absorbed optic opponent tank damage pay win tank like 6 stop keep review little short close warthunder become much better game player online earn money gaijin want pull much money remaining player possible instead recognizing problem solving

289070,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"After putting in about 1500 hours at the time of writing this, I think it's safe to say I can write a somehwat informed review (because I have opinions and I like to share them, that's why). I'm no veteran Civ player, I've only played 5 and 6, though I'm aware that 3 and 4 are still good games. However, even coming from 5 which had it's own disappointing launch, 6 is a massive drop in depth and quality. No matter how hard I try, I cannot lose myself in this game the way I did in 5. I'm never on edge, wondering what will happen next, because I know what'll happen next. War. War for settling wrong. War for being the wrong religion. War for governing wrong. War for being too strong and too week (at the same time). War for not trading. War for simply existing in a manner that doesn't quite suit somebody else. What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with ""agendas"", results in predictable games where everyone hates you, or everyone loves you (until they don't). There's never a middle ground.

On agendas, certain civs simply don't play themselves as they should. Hey Brazil, I see you've denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you. Would you like to change that? Maybe build a campus or theater square? No? Just gonna build another encampment? Thought so. Nice to meet you China. No I didn't realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world. Do you know why? It's because you never built one China, that's why. Ah, Cleopatra, I see you're now chronically indecisive, as you simultaneously hate and love large militaries, and simply can't make your mind up. These agendas will override everything else you do with/to another civ. If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continent, you might be inclined to pitch in on good ol' America's behalf. But more fool you, because you see, America hates people who declare war on his neighbours, even if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash. A man's got to have a code after all. Now you're a warmonger. Why? Good question, but it's ok, Alexander the Great still loves you.

The next part of my rant jamboree is the design of the game, such as unit scaling and modelling and such. Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a ""mobile game"" aesthetic, justly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously. Thankfully, the gameplay hasn't been dumbed down, so much as screwed up (see agendas). I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards me, because I'm too distracted by the trader, whose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace. In Civ 5, when the Mongol horde was at my borders, it stretched on and on like, well, a horde. Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all together, each being roughly the size of an entire building, and altogether looking rather silly. If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol horde, or anyone else's horde for that matter. The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitude.

The AI in Civ 6 cannot war, which is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war. Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to man, but rest assured, it'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following; ranged units + garrion promotion, place in city centres and encampments. Or just wait them out, when you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate life, or throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support. It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planes, so I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soon.

I will now try to think of some nice things to say about Civ 6. You can use mods in multiplayer games fairly easily. See that overpowered civ from your favorite TV show that was obviously made by a fan with no thought to game balance? Yup, you can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence. The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friends, where the only real competition in science, culture, faith and of course, war, are the other human players. The AI might aswell be so many other city states. Oh and the music. While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic. Entering the industrial era to ""Scotland the Brave"" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfying, to say the least. But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the map, and that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this one, and that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning. And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself. And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion mods.

(oh yeah and districts aren't that special, I always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)

(I'll stop typing now I am very tired)

EDIT:

I have so many hours played in this game because of friends who used to enjoy playing it. As they lost interest, I lost interest. There were other mods I used that also made it fun, which are no longer usable since the summer patch (I think, it might have been the spring one I can't remember). I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should. Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release. Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchise, I don't know. Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game. That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have played, or whether or not I ""got my money's worth"".

(While I understand where some people are coming from with the ""you played a bunch but didn't like it so why did you play it"" mentality, I would not take any review seriously with few hours played, regardless of wether they reccomended it or not. If my friends came with the game in a sort of package deal, then sure I'd reccomend it, but I got them elsewhere)

GS EDIT:

Another DLC, and with it some more game mechanics for the AI to struggle with. There's really not much more to it than that. Obvious one is climate change and disasters, of which there is very little change and it's not very disastrous. Just keep a builder or two on stand by if you're in a disaster prone area and you'll be fine. Of the couple times I've had the patience to see a game to completion, not once did the sea level rise, which leads me to believe that you have to really go out of your way to screw up the planet. The main incentive for burning fossil fuels seems to be powering tier 3 buildings in certain districts. Not only is this not necessary, as these buildings still provide their standard yield, but you can just hold out for cleaner energy sources a couple more techs down the line.

The other ""new"" mechanic is the world congress (for some reason starting in the year 500 AD), which at the very least is a more nostalgic kind of stupid. Fans of Civ 5 can look back on fond memories of the great nations of the world banding together against the true enemy of civilization, truffles. Voting yourself is pointless (unless you're playing Sweden), because the AI will mass vote to ban random things regardless of whether it hurts them or not.",putting 1500 hour time writing think safe say write somehwat informed review opinion like share veteran civ player played 5 6 though aware 3 4 still good game however even coming 5 disappointing launch 6 massive drop depth quality matter hard try lose game way 5 never edge wondering happen next know happen next war war settling wrong war wrong religion war governing wrong war strong week time war trading war simply existing manner quite suit somebody else seems attempt inject personality diplomacy agenda result predictable game everyone hate everyone love never middle ground agenda certain civs simply play hey brazil see denounced literally everyone earth making great people would like change maybe build campus theater square gon na build another encampment thought nice meet china realize preemminent builder wonder world know never built one china ah cleopatra see chronically indecisive simultaneously hate love large military simply make mind agenda override everything else another civ friend america watch helpless aztec burn pillage way across continent might inclined pitch good ol america behalf fool see america hate people declare war neighbour even neighbour currently enslaving people turning city ash man got code warmonger good question ok alexander great still love next part rant jamboree design game unit scaling modelling game launched many people expressed concern mobile game aesthetic justly concerned 2k might trying grant next installment mass appeal expense anyone able take seriously thankfully gameplay dumbed much screwed see agenda terrified army strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figure marching towards distracted trader whose cart 2 3 time taller palace civ 5 mongol horde border stretched like well horde appears maybe 20 horse together roughly size entire building altogether looking rather silly course another reason intimidated mongol horde anyone else horde matter entire combined force ai civs could beaten back damp rag attitude ai civ 6 war particularly damning game always end war alexander great macedon may command fearsome force known man rest assured soundly defeated simply following ranged unit garrion promotion place city centre encampment wait think enemy gained advantage sit contemplate life throw away fortified unit ranged support worth pointing launch ai even know use boat plane hold breath anyone el change time soon try think nice thing say civ 6 use mod multiplayer game fairly easily see overpowered civ favorite tv show obviously made fan thought game balance yup bring game friend make regret basking presence fun managed game friend real competition science culture faith course war human player ai might aswell many city state oh music miss wartime music listening cheerful kongo theme nuclear hellfire engulfs planet bit jarring whole idea music evolving era fantastic entering industrial era scotland brave blaring ear agressively bagpipe inferior nation world submission satisfying say least realize building city map last game tried get one enemy contending really contending much falling behind decided give winning everyone denounces close winning get tired try get civ 5 work bagillion mod oh yeah district special always end building 2 3 different city variation stop typing tired edit many hour played game friend used enjoy playing lost interest lost interest mod used also made fun longer usable since summer patch think might spring one remember reccomend game stand civ game time time modding community found fixed bug dealt release maybe next big dlc make civ6 game worthy franchise know time think anyone buy game opinion entitled matter many hour played whether got money worth understand people coming played bunch like play mentality would take review seriously hour played regardless wether reccomended friend came game sort package deal sure reccomend got elsewhere g edit another dlc game mechanic ai struggle really much obvious one climate change disaster little change disastrous keep builder two stand disaster prone area fine couple time patience see game completion sea level rise lead believe really go way screw planet main incentive burning fossil fuel seems powering tier 3 building certain district necessary building still provide standard yield hold cleaner energy source couple tech line new mechanic world congress reason starting year 500 ad least nostalgic kind stupid fan civ 5 look back fond memory great nation world banding together true enemy civilization truffle voting pointless unless playing sweden ai mass vote ban random thing regardless whether hurt

To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"Lines from the Creator of this masterpiece...

""Mental illness has been with us as long as we have been on this earth, but why ? Why hasn't evolution stamped out this weakness from within our gene pool ? I often Pondered this question until I realized that the question had an in-built flaw. It assumes that being and thinking differently is a weakness. The only reason we have computers, spacecraft, medicine, poetry, art and yes even video-games, is because individuals were able to simulate new abstract realities in their mind and share them with the rest of us. We need people to be willing to see differently in order for us to progress as a society. And we need to be open to these new ways of seeing. And it is this spirit that motivated me to create Senua's story and share it with you.""

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"The consequence of having too small a pool for feedback. This is a strange side grade to Dominions 5 that is going to take a year or two to fix. There are many welcome features, like automating site searching, coupled with changes that are just mind boggling, like the new UI and the removal of useful information from many screens. Many new changes are superficially cool but change nothing, or make things negligibly worse, like rocks and trees being physical entities in battlefields

Some of the new nations have yet to find their footing and play like filler (looking at you, EA Pyrene) from a mod, and not every nation has adjusted well to their spells being moved to the new magic path. Many balance changes feel 'odd', but only time can tell how they will affect the game overall. What I can say, is that the new cave layers have permitted me to play badly and survive, in ways that would get me wiped off the face of the earth in 4 or 5.  At least they're optional, but all this combines for a release that still feels like it's in beta.

The biggest positive changes in 6 are the enormous increase in potential for modding, and the fact that there is now an ingame lobby. The larger mods here are going to dwarf everything that came before them, and it is great to see that new players will no longer be reliant on histrionic weirdos from Discord. But, until then, is it worth buying if you already own 5 and have a community that plays it? I don't know.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"Just giving my two cents on the game so far :) 
There’s a few things I really like and some other bits that I don’t.

Things I like: 
- The amount of colour choices for items is amazing I love that!
- Copying items and their colours is amazing!
- Changing the colour of an item without having to buy it all over again is amazing!
- Little knick knack items yes please, give me more :)
- I like not having to assemble things
- little plant pots are so sweet I like adding my own plants to them (but would also be nice to have some already made plants in pots like hf1)
- Can add your own photos to frames
- You can move a table and everything stays on it
- I like the minimal hud/no minimap

Things I don’t like/would like to see/I’m being picky.

- Houses look really weird without curtain/blinds so they would be a great addition!
- Painting is a pain, I like being able to choose the area I want to paint but it’s slow and annoying even when upgraded, I really liked hf1 painting. A sensitivity option for the paint roller would be nice
- An option for disabling the night and day cycle would be great!
- With hf1 items would become transparent when placing flooring I’d like that to happen in hf2 when placing floors or wall panels, paper, tiles etc. As it gets annoying to move furniture out all the time to tile or panel behind them. (I’m weird and like to place furniture before I do the walls or flooring)
- I’d like to be able to turn off the grid, I don’t personally like looking at the green dots and lines (not sure if there is a setting that I’m missing but I can’t find one anywhere to turn it off)

703080,Planet Zoo,"After more than a thousand hours of play, I think it's time to write a review.
I will keep the review short.

Who is Planet Zoo for?

Planet Zoo is aimed at players who want to build their own zoo and do a little management.
Planet Zoo is not for fans of management games. The developer has put his focus on other game content.
The game places a particularly high value on the creativity of the player because there are actually no limits to creativity.
Building may not be so easy at the beginning. But there are countless helpful YouTube videos with tutorials.

There is also an interesting campaign, a story mode that introduces you to the game, which explains a lot but not everything. YouTube helps here, too.

What awaits you !

First of all, many animal species from all over the world. In the game there are animals that live in enclosures and animals and insects that live in vivariums.
There are different biomes like the desert, the tropics, the taiga, the tundra and temperate land like in Europe or North America.
The graphics look fantastic but are very hardware hungry. A good CPU is especially important. The graphics card is secondary.

Your creativity is needed !

It starts with the paths, how wide should they be, how should they look like?
The buildings you need, do I use prefabricated building plans or do I create some myself. There are lots of materials in the game to build them yourself. Walls, boards, decoration, etc. But Planet Zoo has a problem with proportions. There are simply too few small or short components - you always have to improvise. 
If you don't want to build it yourself, the Steam Workshop will help you - there are countless building plans. But if you want to build your own, you don't need the workshop, but you can get some very good ideas here.

The Management System:

The management system is kept really simple.

Once you get the hang of it, you won't go broke.
The main focus is then on allocating the staff, which is not absolutely necessary. It is important to provide food and drink, because visitors are always thirsty and hungry and of course they want clean toilets. The shops should be placed in such a way that the visitors visit every corner of the zoo. Shops often attract visitors more than animals. It may also be important to start with less interesting animals in the entrance area of the zoo and to place the great animals further back as your zoo grows.
And of course you should place the staff buildings appropriately. But this sounds more complicated than it is.

Conclusion:

If you like animals, this is a good choice.
If you like building, you should get it.
Those who love management games should look around for something else.

I love building my own zoo without Steam Workshop items. That's why I have such a long playtime. 
It can often take several hours or days to build a good building or enclosure.

Whether you really need the DLC is up to you, but I think they are indispensable for every creative player.
I think the DLCs where only animals are present are only interesting for animal lovers and not for creative players.",thousand hour play think time write review keep review short planet zoo planet zoo aimed player want build zoo little management planet zoo fan management game developer put focus game content game place particularly high value creativity player actually limit creativity building may easy beginning countless helpful youtube video tutorial also interesting campaign story mode introduces game explains lot everything youtube help awaits first many animal specie world game animal live enclosure animal insect live vivarium different biome like desert tropic taiga tundra temperate land like europe north america graphic look fantastic hardware hungry good cpu especially important graphic card secondary creativity needed start path wide look like building need use prefabricated building plan create lot material game build wall board decoration etc planet zoo problem proportion simply small short component always improvise want build steam workshop help countless building plan want build need workshop get good idea management system management system kept really simple get hang go broke main focus allocating staff absolutely necessary important provide food drink visitor always thirsty hungry course want clean toilet shop placed way visitor visit every corner zoo shop often attract visitor animal may also important start le interesting animal entrance area zoo place great animal back zoo grows course place staff building appropriately sound complicated conclusion like animal good choice like building get love management game look around something else love building zoo without steam workshop item long playtime often take several hour day build good building enclosure whether really need dlc think indispensable every creative player think dlcs animal present interesting animal lover creative player
1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"Having played this game for nearly 1000 hours now, here's what I can say.

The good : 

- An incredible amount of content. Even if you're not planning to subscribe, you still get access to 8 class stories, who take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them and if you do side missions. Then there's the usual MMORPG content, 4 man dungeons (called flashpoints), 16 man raids (operations) and world bosses all with different difficulty levels.
- Quality of writing / storytelling. The story in this game is amazing and stands far above any other MMO I've played. It's essentially high quality Bioware single player writing, but in an MMO. Some class stories stand out, like the Bond-esque Agent story, or the classic overpowered sith story of the warrior. Whoever you are, you'll find a story that suits your style.
- A combat system with suprising depth. A lot of classes that feel clunky at first get those clunky abilities replaced as you level up and when you reach max level ""alacrity"" (increase attack speed) makes everything fluid and fast. I was quite suprised, coming from WoW and having also played Tera a lot.
- An immersive world with incredible music and suprisingly good graphics, despite it's age.
- You can live your childhood (or adulthood!) fantasy of being a jedi or sith lord, with your own lightsaber and very cool armor set that you can customize.
- The companion system is quite fleshed out, even if it got simplified over the years from what I read. Your class story will give you access to 5 companions and you can gather more. By the time you reach where the SWtoR story is at now, you'll have a few dozens. Companions can all be geared up with the oufits of your choice and story companions all interact with you and have different personalities and preferences.
- The subscription system is fairly good. If you subscribe once (15$) you will be a preferred member once your sub runs out, still giving you access to more content and features, so that's definitely worth it. If you never sub, however, your adventure will end shortly after the class stories (which can easily give you up to 500 hours of fun if you do all 8..!), you will not be able to hit max level and will be capped at 1 million credits (which isn't that much once you start getting really into the game). <-- edit : Upon reflection, I moved the subscription system from ""meh"" to ""good"".

The meh :

- Fun and high skill cap pvp. Because of alacrity and the pacing at max level, pvp is quite engaging. Everyone gets a built in pvp trinket in their kit, and interrupt and a stun. It's not incredibly balanced, but most classes should have one spec that works. There is however a bad side to pvp in this game, people are toxic as fuck in ranked (the most toxic community I've encountered so far), and I'm warning you as someone who reached the highest level of PvP in quite a few mmo's and played online games with a ""PvP mindset"" for the past 25 years (first by griefing people in diablo 1 as a 10 year old kid and getting Gladiator a few times in WoW during college. Yeah I'm a boomer.).
- The gearing system is quite linear. Once you hit max level, you'll want to get your item level to 306, and anything you do in the world will drop gear near your current average item level. This means that you could solo your way to a fully optimized set of gear. Of course, if you party up and run group content this process will go faster. Once you hit 306 (max item level currently) you can hoard those items and twink your fresh lvl 75 alts, putting them in best in slot gear instantly. This is either good or bad depending on the type of player you are. If you're hoping to be one in a million in BiS gear because it's locked behind hard raids, you'll be dissapointed.
- The tab target combat system is tied and true, but dated. I don't mind it, as long as the game is responsive when I use abilities, but for some people it can be boring. This game is no Tera / BDO as far as combat goes, that's for sure.

The bad : 

- While there are cool looking sets that can drop for you from running content, the coolest armors (and boy are they dope) are all real money cosmetics. Unless you want to shell out the credits and buy them from people who used real money in the first place. Admittedly, the cash shop is probably what's keeping the lights on this game.
- Speaking of using real cash, while gearing is so easy it's impossible to call it pay to win, it's definitely pay to get rich. By spending 10$ you can buy a store item that you can then resell for somewhere around 150 million credits, which is quite a lot, but won't get you one of the best looking lightsabers that go for 500-600 million credits (or 50$ on the store!). Again, purely cosmetic. You could be using an ugly wooden lightsaber and it would do the exact same damage with proper mods.
- I just mentionned credits. This games economy is insanely inflated and it's not gonna get better. People who get rich in this game (billionnaires) either use real money and resell items or play the GTN (auction house) on a daily basis.

All in all, I'm  happy I picked this game up. The last time I spent so much time on an mmo was in the better days of WoW. SWtoR has it's flaws, but it's definitely an epic game with an insane amount of high quality content. You should at the very least pick it up and run the class stories for free.

294100,RimWorld,"If you're thinking of buying this game, stop hesitating and purchase it, immediately.

I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland, as a 74-year-old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar; I researched robotics to begin with, and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning, cooking and hauling, etc, leaving me free to conduct my research. All was well- until a band of savages laid siege to my settlement. I barely survived- but resolved to increase my security, installing several auto-turrets around my perimeter. This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time, but I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements.

I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon. When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland, I did not hesitate to inspect their wares. I wanted a slave, but not just any slave- he should be foreboding, brutal and utterly without mercy! And that was when I found him. His name was Skint Mcgruff. He was a feared crime lord when they captured him, infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him. I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in. I fed him (alas, not the human meat he desired, but nutrient paste, made from potatoes- poor fare, but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him.

By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form, and so I presented the idea to him the very next day. He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began. My medical droid handled most of the surgery, but I crafted the bionic components myself. It was a long and grueling process, but eventually, he was complete. More machine now than man, I felt it necessary to rename him... to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more, and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A.L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs). He is my pride and joy... bionic eyes that can see even in the dark, bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah, and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes, and of course, I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward.

Now, I can finally conduct my research in peace...",thinking buying game stop hesitating purchase immediately started isolated research facility frozen wasteland 74 year old sociopathic scientist called geckulon decktar researched robotics begin constructed automaton handle menial task like cleaning cooking hauling etc leaving free conduct research well band savage laid siege settlement barely survived resolved increase security installing several auto turret around perimeter would keep ruffian bay time needed longer term solution turned focus bionic enhancement wanted turn human form ultimate living weapon faction slaver passed frozen wasteland hesitate inspect ware wanted slave slave foreboding brutal utterly without mercy found name skint mcgruff feared crime lord captured infamous killing devouring people wronged paid slaver due took skint fed ala human meat desired nutrient paste made potato poor fare life frozen waste clothed confident ability improve upon human form presented idea next day keen particularly notion retractable claw work began medical droid handled surgery crafted bionic component long grueling process eventually complete machine man felt necessary rename symbolise departure prosaic humanity something thus named c n n b l cybernetic armoured neutraliser neurally integrated bionic attack limb pride joy bionic eye see even dark bionic leg allow sprint faster cheetah retractable claw tear throat foe course give leave feast corps afterward reward finally conduct research peace

1551360,Forza Horizon 5,"Best Forza Horizon game to date, especially with the improvements to the graphics and vehicle sounds. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editing this review for a ton more information, hope it's not overwhelming:

--PROS:
`Looks incredible when everything loads correctly (see below).

`Vehicle sounds are a huge step in the right direction, especially with vehicle upgrades changing things even more to make each car sound unique.

`Extremely fun, whether it be cruising around the map looking for XP boards or racing along the coast.

`The map is pretty big and all the different areas make exploring incredibly fun.

`Lots of things to do, I won't be getting bored of this game any time soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--CONS:
`The graphics have a few bugs, such as some pop-in and some clay-looking textures.

`The online play has been rough, but they recently fixed a bug where constant disconnects would happen; just wish there was a better system to get together with friends in free-roam.

`Horizon Arcade (formerly Forzathon Live) sucks right now. It is very hard to find people to complete the events, and when you do, some of the requirements for said events are extremely hard.

`A few models for the cars are dated (S15 for example).

`Some accolades require playing eliminator (Not really a con, I just hate battle royale modes :D)

Final conclusion: The pros outweigh the cons significantly; this is pretty much the best open-world racing game you can play to date.

386360,SMITE®,"Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years now, these Steam hours are merely 1/5 of my whole playtime.
I've spent about 2000 euros on this game, and while I don't regret any of those purchases, I really can't recommend this game in this state. Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.

If you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.

Back when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.

Let's put this into perspective: There are literally [b]128 types of chests[/b] in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20€ to 6,40€ respectively, [b]per roll[/b]. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20€. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wanted. 
And every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called ""odyssey"". Smite teases one ""Tier5 skin"", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20€. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100€, if not more, in this great ""odyssey"", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several ""adventures"". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent ""adventure"", because that's just a pure joke.

Now, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. 

Second, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b]. You basically have a ghost. 
Also, sometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether. Present since beta, they're just addressing it, after 4 years.

While we're at it, I just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritism, regarding both gods and modes. As you would expect with gods, there are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against. These can usually be identified by looking at their skins, because they usually have billions. Examples would be Loki, Neith, Hercules or Nox. These are not necessarily overpowered, but have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play against. 
Now modes. Like I said before, Smite has a multitude of gamemodes, many more than Hots, LoL or DotA. Now, the issue is, the whole game is balanced around the ""main"" mode, Conquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push mode, which every moba has. In my 4 years of Smite, I have played 18 matches of Conquest. To compare, I've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers), 600 in Joust (3v3), 500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena). I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquest, so I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells. Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment. IIRC, one of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest. This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives. Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch Conquest.

At last, Smite's community. I'm more of a casual and average player, but every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic player, sometimes even both. The problem is, that just like in many other games, most players think way too highly of themselves. But Smite players take the cake. They not only play gods, they [i]think they are gods.[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit. You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrow, because ""muh waifu"". It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogame, so rev up these mute buttons. Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence. Also, the matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season. Every game balances the winrate around 50%.

In conclusion, I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive. Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the ground, gunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basement, it's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt. Play this game if you want, but you'll be disappointed in the long run, which is the worst kind of disappointment. Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smite, but at this state, it doesn't make any sense to. I've had my fun, I don't regret a single penny or minute I've spent, but I'm about done.",keep mind played smite 4 year steam hour merely 1 5 whole playtime spent 2000 euro game regret purchase really recommend game state smite problem good game hi rez issue enjoy basically non existent lore cash grab rigged system cancerous matchmaking unbalanced clearly developer favored character bug aplenty one completely incapable utterly useless ceo hold back whole department one toxic community even rival overwatch community smite game back started playing smite still open beta probably favorite game year diverse set apart mobas 3rd person perspective ton different map also great concept could buy skin wanted hi rez published first chest 2 exclusive skin quickly realized much money could make garbage system following year 95 new skin exclusive limited put cash grab event chest time single directly purchasable skin 6 month day still god well 5 skin exclusive let put perspective literally b 128 type chest b game range 200gems 400gems 3 20 6 40 respectively b per roll b new player 0 55 item curiosity chest roll cost 3 20 chest also rigged joking mean get skin 53 55 put staggering 170 get one skin wanted every single season grande finale cash grab called odyssey smite tease one tier5 skin skin change basically everything god offer term design comparable lol ultimate skin cost 20 issue directly buy skin b b get ton exclusive skin probably even want one t5 skin barely worth 20 buck lose 100 great odyssey hi rez like title odyssey also often accompanied several adventure adventure basically one sort rpg choose one god kill monster catch map change map always remains reward either locked behind paywall would guessed tedious grind fest probably take million brain cell 2 week life even going talk recent adventure pure joke bug smite suffers many bug many present since closed beta recent one gamebreaking honestly joke fixed yet first 99 match lobby chat work even appear chat box communicate teammate pick god second also 99 match one god load stats screen basically mean press tab list particular god see item turn mean know build see relic even score kill b even listed team b basically ghost also sometimes game freeze defeat win screen crash alltogether present since beta addressing 4 year want point hi rez favoritism regarding god mode would expect god certain god blatantly overpowered unfun play usually identified looking skin usually billion example would loki neith hercules nox necessarily overpowered heavily bloated kit make almost unkillable totally unfun play mode like said smite multitude gamemodes many hots lol dota issue whole game balanced around main mode conquest typical 5v5 tower minion push mode every moba 4 year smite played 18 match conquest compare played 2000 match arena 5v5 without tower 600 joust 3v3 500 siege 4v4 900 match clash 5v5 mix conquest arena never really found ambition learn 4851 rule conquest stuck gamemodes barely required 2 5 braincells hi rez try force conquest throat every single possible moment iirc one design leader even talked removing mode people would flock conquest alone truly catch sheer incompetence hi rez executive player even stated would quit even touch conquest last smite community casual average player every single match plagued atleast one incredibly inept time low level matchmaking suck toxic player sometimes even problem like many game player think way highly smite player take cake play god think god ultimate pinacle garbage game offer found reddit criticize one single god without white knight showing defending true love like tomorrow muh waifu one toxic communites ever see videogame rev mute button aware mute incompetence also matchmaking fucking bad legit 85 winrate season every game balance winrate around 50 conclusion fascinated hi rez smite still alive hi rez ran many good game ground gunned street left rot bug infested basement miracle company bankrupt play game want disappointed long run worst kind disappointment many year defended hi rez smite state make sense fun regret single penny minute spent done

2344520,Diablo® IV,"This is my first diablo game. The gameplay loop is pretty fun, I can see why the series is popular. It's grindy in a fun mindless way, and it's a good movie/podcast game. But the focus on multiplayer and monetization hampers it. I just wanted to play this single player, and you can't as it's always online. It shouldn't be deck verified for that reason alone. It's not really a handlheld game to take on a flight, you have to have wifi. Even if you play solo. You can't pause the game for this reason either, so if you have to get up frequently or put games to sleep, this one isn't it for you. The game seems like it was once a good game, and then they in modern fashion stripped away all rewards and incentive for playing and charge for it. I got this for 40 dollars and beat the main story, with one character. I didn't do any of the post game and only did maybe a third of the side quest. You are bombarded with ads frequently, every time you unlock some tier, or to go to the map, there is an ad asking you to buy an overpriced cosmetic. The armor and stuff you unlock in game all looks the same, incentive's you to buy the predatory monetization cosmetics. I paid 41 for this game on sale. I truthfully think it's worth maybe 30 in it's current state , maybe less. I played at a leisurely pace and beat the main game and a 3rd of the side quest in 37 hours, solo.. If you're playing with friends, you might get more value out of it and beat it faster or replay it, but I play single player because as a 32 year old with a weird schedule, it's hard to find time to party up with friends, and most of my friends don't play this type of game, and I'm too much of an introvert to add strangers and play. After work I just want to chill, and this game almost has that chill vibe to it, but it's got to constantly shoe horn in ads and purchases, and that ruins it for me personally. I have no desire to play it again due to it's short comings. If i could give a neutral review, I would. But due to the negatives outweighing the positives, I am giving it a negative review. I've heard D1,2, and 3 are better. If they ever come to steam I'd give them a chance, but I don't think I'd give Diablo 5 a chance until it hits maybe 20 to 30 bucks if it's like this one. I don't like games as a service games, and this game is really trying to be that, disguising itself as an RPG, and that's just not for me personally.",first diablo game gameplay loop pretty fun see series popular grindy fun mindless way good movie podcast game focus multiplayer monetization hamper wanted play single player always online deck verified reason alone really handlheld game take flight wifi even play solo pause game reason either get frequently put game sleep one game seems like good game modern fashion stripped away reward incentive playing charge got 40 dollar beat main story one character post game maybe third side quest bombarded ad frequently every time unlock tier go map ad asking buy overpriced cosmetic armor stuff unlock game look incentive buy predatory monetization cosmetic paid 41 game sale truthfully think worth maybe 30 current state maybe le played leisurely pace beat main game 3rd side quest 37 hour solo playing friend might get value beat faster replay play single player 32 year old weird schedule hard find time party friend friend play type game much introvert add stranger play work want chill game almost chill vibe got constantly shoe horn ad purchase ruin personally desire play due short coming could give neutral review would due negative outweighing positive giving negative review heard d1 2 3 better ever come steam give chance think give diablo 5 chance hit maybe 20 30 buck like one like game service game game really trying disguising rpg personally
108600,Project Zomboid,"Easily the best survival game I've played.
Easily the best zombie game I've played.

However, this zombie survival game doesn't play so easily.
It's rough, it's tough, it's punishing, but it's rewarding. There are plateaus, not skill curves. 

Getting your first laceration from climbing through a broken window. Stomping a zombies head 10 times and wondering why it won't die because you're exhausted. Finding your first gun and realising at 0 skill it's really just a loud trumpet. Leaving something in the oven too long and causing a house fire. Accidentally pressing Q and getting your freshly done-up base surrounded. It's all part of the tried and true ""learn from your mistakes"" style of gameplay. 

Before long, you start to get comfortable with the threat of the zombies, and begin to experiment. ""Ah,"" you think, ""I can continually lure them through this window or over a fence! And they always trip!"" And you feel so smart after killing 4 zombies in a row this way, until the 5th and 6th one both do a lunge and teach you a lesson. In the next life, you add fire to the mix - constantly kiting the horde around a single flame, feeling once again so smug about your genius brain, until you find yourself surrounded by the flames. 

Next time, you score yourself a car, and find out how devastating they are to the zoombinis. ""Tally-ho!"" you yell as you continually joust zombie hordes down the main streets, loud engine drawing more and more to the slaughter. You run down a few dozen more, maybe even learning of the ""whirlwind"" tactic as you drive around. But then the world goes quiet, and your car begins to silently coast, too slow to run down the horde that you were planning on. They come. They surround. They devour. ""Damn"". Another lesson in mortality. But you've learned. A car is a tool. Noise is a tool. Fire is a tool. And you are the Tool Man, with the world as your workshop. Blaze down the highways with your siren, lure the decaying ones to the purging flame, and cry as you accidentally run the car into a pole and break your neck, surrounded by the horde once again.

This is how you died.",easily best survival game played easily best zombie game played however zombie survival game play easily rough tough punishing rewarding plateau skill curve getting first laceration climbing broken window stomping zombie head 10 time wondering die exhausted finding first gun realising 0 skill really loud trumpet leaving something oven long causing house fire accidentally pressing q getting freshly done base surrounded part tried true learn mistake style gameplay long start get comfortable threat zombie begin experiment ah think continually lure window fence always trip feel smart killing 4 zombie row way 5th 6th one lunge teach lesson next life add fire mix constantly kiting horde around single flame feeling smug genius brain find surrounded flame next time score car find devastating zoombinis tally ho yell continually joust zombie horde main street loud engine drawing slaughter run dozen maybe even learning whirlwind tactic drive around world go quiet car begin silently coast slow run horde planning come surround devour damn another lesson mortality learned car tool noise tool fire tool tool man world workshop blaze highway siren lure decaying one purging flame cry accidentally run car pole break neck surrounded horde died
548430,Deep Rock Galactic,"Lmao. There are gigantic companies producing multiplayer games that cost hundreds of millions of dollars for development time and marketing, and this $25 early access game about mining and killing bugs as a dwarf is the best co-op game I've played in years.

Review Update a year and a half later: Tons of updates and a couple hundred hours in and still one of the best co-op games to date. One of my favorite games in general for sure. 

I just bought a round of beer for my team that made us shart ourselves, then bought another round of beer that made us explode forward like rockets. So we were all flying/exploding around the space station while sharting and yelling ROCK AND STONE to each other while techno played from the jukebox at the space bar. We then threw our mugs at each other, kicked a bunch of barrels into each others faces, slapped the fuzzy dice hanging on the dash of the huge drill drop pod thing you go down in, go out into our cave and immediately die from a gigantic detonator just to go back up and get drunk all over again.

2021 Update: ROCK. AND. STOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE.",lmao gigantic company producing multiplayer game cost hundred million dollar development time marketing 25 early access game mining killing bug dwarf best co op game played year review update year half later ton update couple hundred hour still one best co op game date one favorite game general sure bought round beer team made u shart bought another round beer made u explode forward like rocket flying exploding around space station sharting yelling rock stone techno played jukebox space bar threw mug kicked bunch barrel others face slapped fuzzy dice hanging dash huge drill drop pod thing go go cave immediately die gigantic detonator go back get drunk 2021 update rock stoooooooooooooone
2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"First, to the old Dominions players - what's new:
- New magic school, which will take some time to explore and evaluate properly. 
- Some new nations (of course).
- Changed battle mechanics here and there, for example the split between a rider and mount.
- Some pretender build tweaks.
- Additional planes on top of the ""surface"" one. Caves are now a plane of their own, for example.
- New UI, quite similar to Conquest of Elysium.
- New music tracks. 
- Improved animations and sprites (not all of them of course :) ).
There are probably many other devils hiding in the details but I played my first game with a non-Blood nation, so will need some more playthroughs to find them. ;)

Now, to the new players. What to expect from Dominions? 
Well... I don't even know where to start. The game is so massive in terms of features, combinations and replayability that it will take nothing smaller than a book of a few hundred pages to explain it in general and then maybe another few volumes of similar sizes to deep-dive into the specifics. What you see from the pictures is what you get aesthetically - the graphics are lagging behind at least 20 years (which easy to explain when you take into account that the series is made by... 2 people) and the few animations aren't much more contemporary, so the game is strictly for people who don't care about eye-candies. Taking that obvious part out, you're left with something which can easily be a ""desert island"" game which keeps delivering new stuff even after hundreds of hours.

In short - you are a powerful being which competes with other folks from the same tier for the title of the God-Emperor of the world (which is a near-literal translation of Pantokrator anyway). You do that in turn-based fashion, building cities, temples, magical laboratories and armies, summoning a vast array of creatures ranging from lowly insects to huge demons and titans and casting spells that can literally warp the reality. The battles can seem deceptively ""simplistic"" at first, especially given that they are auto-resolved, but nothing can be farther from the truth - each clash can be planned to the smallest detail in advance (of course you have to take into account that the enemy also has plans contrary to yours). After a hundred turns you will observe the clash of armies involving hundreds, even thousands of troops, so the scale is grand everywhere. 

Something which deserves a very high praise about this game is its ""lore"". There is no story per se and no real goal other than ""crush everyone"", however each nation, each spell, each creature and each simple soldier have descriptions which can be very detailed and put together form a very interesting and comprehensive picture. Dominions' universe is based on mythologies - not your regular fantasy with elves, orcs and dragons - and is actually pretty close to your grandma or her grandma's grandma would tell about the world of magic. I don't think there's another game that pays such a good tribute to the actual real-world mythological themes and even philosophies, so the game is worth buying even just for the reading content, as paradoxically as that may sound. 

The music is very good too. :) The actual sounds during battle... not so much, but you can't have everything.

About the price tag - yes, it's high for an indie game. It's more than worth it though. I'm playing the series since Dominions 3 and I'm willing to pay for each new installment just to support the people keeping that world alive. They deserve it. Plus - you pay that price once and then you get several years of free support and new content, which nowadays is considered a mythological business practice. The game is true to its theme even here. :)",first old dominion player new new magic school take time explore evaluate properly new nation course changed battle mechanic example split rider mount pretender build tweak additional plane top surface one cave plane example new ui quite similar conquest elysium new music track improved animation sprite course probably many devil hiding detail played first game non blood nation need playthroughs find new player expect dominion well even know start game massive term feature combination replayability take nothing smaller book hundred page explain general maybe another volume similar size deep dive specific see picture get aesthetically graphic lagging behind least 20 year easy explain take account series made 2 people animation much contemporary game strictly people care eye candy taking obvious part left something easily desert island game keep delivering new stuff even hundred hour short powerful competes folk tier title god emperor world near literal translation pantokrator anyway turn based fashion building city temple magical laboratory army summoning vast array creature ranging lowly insect huge demon titan casting spell literally warp reality battle seem deceptively simplistic first especially given auto resolved nothing farther truth clash planned smallest detail advance course take account enemy also plan contrary hundred turn observe clash army involving hundred even thousand troop scale grand everywhere something deserves high praise game lore story per se real goal crush everyone however nation spell creature simple soldier description detailed put together form interesting comprehensive picture dominion universe based mythology regular fantasy elf orcs dragon actually pretty close grandma grandma grandma would tell world magic think another game pay good tribute actual real world mythological theme even philosophy game worth buying even reading content paradoxically may sound music good actual sound battle much everything price tag yes high indie game worth though playing series since dominion 3 willing pay new installment support people keeping world alive deserve plus pay price get several year free support new content nowadays considered mythological business practice game true theme even

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"You might be wondering why on Earth would someone with so few hours logged into this game write a review on it, surely they can’t be serious? Well, [i]Star Wars: The Old Republic[/i] launched in December of 2011, but it wasn’t on any platform like this; Origin came out earlier during the same year, however this game never required it and still doesn’t. I’ve actually been playing SW:TOR, on and off, since June 2012 and just haven’t used the Steam version until recently. I have 10 characters in the game – 1 at level 75, 1x65, 7x50+, 1x34 – and my total playtime spread across them all, discovered using the “/played” command and tallied up, tells me I’ve put almost [b]772 hours[/b] (over 295 of those hours spent on a single character) into SW:TOR at the time of writing this review… This is excluding loading screens and such. I’ve experienced practically all the story content this MMO has to offer, and I’ve played both as a subscriber and on a free account, but I’ve only dabbled in PVP. If you don’t believe me then just look at the 167 Steam achievements.

SW:TOR used to cost a full game’s price plus a recurring fee after one month of play when it was first released in 2011, but since late 2012 BioWare and EA have adopted a free-to-play model for it with an optional subscription. This means that you can download the game from the official website or here on Steam and play it for as long as you like without paying them any money. However, free players have a number of restrictions placed on their accounts, so if you want to play the game for a month or longer it is actually better to subscribe in order to remove those limits and gain access to plenty of extra content (it's also just much more fun that way, as some of the constraints placed on free accounts can be quite annoying). Furthermore, once subscribed you also gain “preferred” status, which grants you unlimited access to all the story content currently available to you even if you cancel your subscription as well as removing some of the F2P account restrictions.

Playing with a free account you can experience the base game (level 0-50) with all 8 class stories and side quests across many planets, as well as the first two expansions ([i]Galactic Starfighter[/i] for expanded space combat and [i]Galactic Strongholds[/i] for player housing). When you subscribe, you obtain the [i]Rise of the Hutt Cartel[/i] and [i]Shadow of Revan[/i] expansion packs (both of which you get to keep even after your subscription runs out) – which also extend your level cap to 60. The next expansion – a story-heavy and singleplayer-focused one called [i]Knights of the Fallen Empire[/i] – increased the cap to level 65 and was released on an episodic basis, with 16 chapters made in total. This model was kept for the subsequent expansion, another episodic story titled [i]Knights of the Eternal Throne[/i] with 9 chapters. After this came [i]Onslaught[/i] and finally this year’s [i]Legacy of the Sith[/i], bringing the new maximum level upwards to 80. If you were to subscribe now, you'd get access to all the stories available thus far (you keep them forever) and any future chapters released during the time that you're still subscribed, but as soon as you stop subscribing you will no longer receive any new chapters until you subscribe again.

Now that we got the basic info out of the way, let me tell you more about why you should probably try this game. When SW:TOR was first announced in October of 2008, I was disappointed. Sure, I was hyped for another Star Wars tale and I loved the Old Republic era thanks to the KotOR games, however it was precisely due to my adoration of KotOR that I felt a little betrayed… What happened to the good old singleplayer RPG storytelling of old? Why was this online multiplayer functionality forced on all those who wanted to see where BioWare would take Revan’s galaxy next? Why not just release a third [i]Knights of the Old Repubic[/i] solo title instead of killing [i]Star Wars Galaxies[/i]? When I finally got my hands on the game though, excited yet cautious, it was unlike any other MMORPG I had played before or since. The gameplay is quite standard, it has been referred to as a [i]World of Warcraft[/i] “clone” – that moniker might not be entirely fair, but there is certainly much truth to it. I liked what little I played of WoW, so the combat and exploration of SW:TOR was more than good enough for me.

No, what really shined here (besides the high-budget visuals and sound effects that come with official Star Wars licensing and funding from a big publisher like Electronic Arts) was indeed the story. Each class was more than just a different playstyle in combat like that of the [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] ruleset or countless other RPGs, because each class gave your character an entirely unique background with its own three-act-spanning plot. The writing and dialogue was of great quality, but most importantly it was all voiced – not only the main class and planetary quests, but every single side mission too! In 2011 when SW:TOR came out it was, minus marketing costs, the most expensive video game ever made; in early 2012 it was officially recognised by Guinness World Records as the “Largest Entertainment Voice Over Project Ever” with over 200,000 lines of recorded dialogue.

In good BioWare fashion, the vast majority of quests in the game allow you to make choices that can decide the fate of not only random tertiary characters, but the lives of your companions or even the outcome of interplanetary conflicts. It’s this focus on storytelling that really makes SW:TOR the best MMO I have ever played, but your mileage may vary depending on what it is you personally look for in a game of this genre. There is plenty of diversity here though, as each class story can be quite unlike the others: from the classic Star Wars hero epic of the Jedi Knight to the spy drama of the Imperial Agent. Content becomes a lot more unified starting with the first expansion [i]Rise of the Hutt Cartel[/i] as the story is more or less the same for all players going from there, still little flavours based on your class/species/gender remain and quest conclusions can be affected by player choice too.

Each in-game exchange is basically an interactive cutscene with a [i]Mass Effect[/i]-style dialogue wheel, including Light Side and Dark Side conversation options with romanceable NPC party members to boot, so fans of the classic BioWare RPG formula will definitely find lots to like here. Initially the spaceflight available in SW:TOR was only on-rails combat, it was pretty to look at but not particularly deep and it got old quick. The end of 2013 brought us [i]Galactic Starfighter[/i], which added free-flying dogfights between players to the game as a much more entertaining variant of space combat, though sadly even now in 2022 you still cannot fly around a star system completely freely like you could in the cosmic sandbox of [i]Star Wars Galaxies[/i]. In fact, in many ways this game is a theme park with sandbox elements (including much more engrossing, open-ended plot and dialogue) as opposed to the sandbox with theme park elements of the good old SWG. Even the planetary environments here are not true open worlds but more like a series of interconnected wide corridors, like that of the [i]Dragon Age[/i] series or the first two [i]Wiedźmin[/i] games, that the player can traverse between at will.

Overall, [i]Star Wars: The Old Republic[/i] is a fantastic game that just keeps getting better and it could give any fan of Star Wars potentially hundreds of hours of fun, especially now that levelling and companions have been streamlined so that you don’t need to go through as much grinding to experience the best of the story content. No other MMO out there has the quality or quantity of the narrative BioWare offers here. If you like Star Wars and enjoy the WoW formula mixed with [i]Mass Effect[/i], then you will most likely love this.",might wondering earth would someone hour logged game write review surely serious

1190970,House Flipper 2,"I love House Flipper games so I don't regret buying House Flipper 2 but I think it's in dire need of QoL updates and more furniture. It feels like they made the things I didn't love about HF1 better in HF2, but miss many features from HF1.

Things that I love about HF2: 
- The dialogue is adorable. I love the phone calls with all characters, especially Tom Marino. I like how you can continue your work while on the phone.
- Some of the new wall decor are so cute
- You can move furniture with items on it !
- Change materials, patterns, and colors is nice

Things I don't love:
- Main story wasn't long, about 14 hours playtime
- Very limited furniture
- Assembly feels like a last minute addition to the game, I often forget about it. 
- I also miss assembly for plumbing in HF1 but I know it's not for everyone.
- Painting is so clunky, I liked HF1 painting better
- Demolition was more realistic in HF1. HF2 demolition: if you break the top, sides, and bottom, the middle pieces float.
- Locations are kinda dry
- Curtains when?
- I miss cars
- Bring back my string lights

Not worth $40. If on sale, maybe worth at half off for now. I know devs are listening to feedback and implementing a lot of it into this game, which is much appreciated, but I feel like it's gonna be a long time before it's worth full price.

397540,Borderlands 3,"Things I liked
- Guns from different manufacturers stand out more.
- Better shooting, driving, and movement.
- Addictive (until it isn’t).
- Having two different special abilities for most characters.
- Typhon DeLeon and his logs were interesting (to me at least).
- Rhys.
- Fast Travel from anywhere, although I would’ve just preferred seeing fast travel stations more often than in Borderlands 2.
- Cryo and radiation as opposed to slag. 
- Dynamic crosshair (when it actually works)


Things I disliked
- Ava.
- Tyrene.
- Standing around doing nothing in Sanctuary, waiting for dialogue to finish.
- Season pass 1, Season pass 2, Designers cut, Directors Cut.
- Unrewarding exploration.
- Mayhem mode.
- Driving levels, especially on true vault hunter.
- Weird glorification of Tannis, who I always saw as nothing more than a joke and plot device (mainly in the first game). 
- Ruined or missed opportunities with the Borderlands 2 protagonists, Zer0 being the only exception, and Kreig, but that’s DLC.
- It’s obvious a lot of content was either completely redone or cut entirely given how long it took to make.
- Danny DeVito was supposed to voice Typhon.
- I still have no idea how the events work.
- Boring and mostly forgettable supporting characters. Like that sheriff dude from Eden 6.
- Boss fights are good, but the actual variety of bosses is weak.


I have more negative points than good but I still think it’s a fun game and I’d recommend it for $30 or less. Also it’s a lot better with friends, like every game.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"Should You Buy Kingdoms and Castles? I have made a short video to help you decide that:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ttpFpTxA4E

Pros:
- The price is right
- Developers are very active in updating and transparent with their community
- There are already FREE future DLC's planned
- 3 different game modes: Easy, Normal, and Hard
- I have put in 20+ hours of fun(played it before it was on Steam) and still want to play it  lots more
- The music is quite good and relaxing

Either:
- The art style is very simplistic and(I think) cute

Cons:
- I have still encountered a few new bugs after every game update but nothing has been game breaking
- The advisors in the game are a bit underwhelming and not useful after the first 5 minutes or so - in fact the notification ""!"" can be a bit annoying when there's nothing important to learn
- On normal mode, the viking attacks can sometimes be frustratingly close together and not allowing you time to recover from the previous attack, but there is always peaceful mode if it becomes too much for you

Overall I have had a lot of fun with this game(around 20 hours played including time outside of Steam) and the price is so low that, if you enjoy simulation and city building games, you will surely get your money's worth of fun out of it. Hope this helps!

Edit: Adding Q/A here from comments:

Q: Is it hard to keep a working economy or does the city run itself like in many other builders once you have the basics down?

A: It runs itself in the sense that you don't have to click on each civilian and tell them what to do - jobs are taken care of automatically once you build the thing that needs workers. However, sometimes you may have the need to close or open the building if you already have enough of that material or you want your people to focus on something else instead. So, in a sense it runs itself but you still have to balance how many foresters you want, how many quarries, blacksmiths, farmers, etc.

Q: Are there goals in the game or is it just build a big a city as possible?

A: It is an open sandbox game so the goals are what you make for yourself. If you need more structure than that then you'll probably get bored fast. But for me, I like to make goals such as - can I actually be  successful enough to build my entire city within castle walls? Can I get my defenses up high enough that I'll be able to have minimal damages when invaded? Can I build an army big enough that I can send my general in and conquer their armies and constantly have bonus happiness from winning battles? Can I expand my kingdom enough to encompass the entire land that is provided to me? Can I have a really happy kingdom while taxing them to the max? So far I have not achieved any of those completely so I am still working towards them.

Q: Are there multiple ways to build a city or will every game take the same course?

A: You can build your city however you want - but there will always be things you need such as wood, stone, and food. You can make the layout however you want as well, and if you don't feel like building churches you don't have to build churches, it will make your citizens unhappy but you can choose to try and make up that deficit with something else.

Q: How many options are there for aesthetics individualiziation of your city? 

A: It is a visually simplistic game which I touched on that may be either a pro or con for people depending on personal taste.

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"[b]Chants of Sennaar[/b] is a really interesting puzzle game that explores the mysteries of a Babel-like tower where every floor speak a different language and have a different culture and vision on other floors' peoples.
I first have to say that I'm a linguist so the principle of learning new languages was a direct catch but may have then been too easy for me. Anyway I had a great time and finished the game in one run (which I would recommend if you don't want to forget languages' structures). 

In the game you have to find meanings to different written characters that define fictionnal languages. You can first type a guess of the meaning in the notebook in the game and it'll later be confirmed through drawings. You don't really have to guess it forever as the words themselves will be confirmed, and therefore locked, by the game.

The game is quite short as I took 10 hours to 100% it. It is fairly easy and as a puzzle game it does not require a lot of skill or agility, tho' there are some infiltration parts that ask you to do things with a certain timing, but it is accessible to everyone I think. The graphic and audio design are simple to read and very pretty and the cultural differences really shine through both music and drawings. It soothes you on certain floors while it'll tense you on other. Great job on these two parts!

[b]The YES:[/b]
- Game is pretty. Like really. Pretty and without a lot of details which make it kind of philosophical.
- A game where you have to guess languages to find clues for the story is always cool.
- Some cultures and languages can hint at real ones which could be a nice add for some people that love cultural appreciation! :)
- The story in itself is kind of intriguing I love it progressing with the different floors.
- Very accessible with few ""tense"" parts. Could be played on a tactile touch screen if it was available. :D
- Performance-friendly
- Lot of translations for the UI

[b]The MID:[/b]
- The game is really easy. Maybe too much ? But at the same time it's not very complex so I guess it's a good compromise?
- No oral language but yes, it would have been a heavy task so I understand, no worries.

[b]The MEH:[/b]
- The game is short. It's kinda sad as the fifth floor is just a few panels and the fifth language is deciphered in only a few minutes.
- The pace of the game can be quite slow at most time, mostly when you have to run (walk) across the level to find a clue that you missed. At least the sceneries are pretty.
- For this length (~10h for 100%) and a very low replayability the price can be considered a bit high.",b chant sennaar b really interesting puzzle game explores mystery babel like tower every floor speak different language different culture vision floor people first say linguist principle learning new language direct catch may easy anyway great time finished game one run would recommend want forget language structure game find meaning different written character define fictionnal language first type guess meaning notebook game later confirmed drawing really guess forever word confirmed therefore locked game game quite short took 10 hour 100 fairly easy puzzle game require lot skill agility tho infiltration part ask thing certain timing accessible everyone think graphic audio design simple read pretty cultural difference really shine music drawing soothes certain floor tense great job two part b yes b game pretty like really pretty without lot detail make kind philosophical game guess language find clue story always cool culture language hint real one could nice add people love cultural appreciation story kind intriguing love progressing different floor accessible tense part could played tactile touch screen available performance friendly lot translation ui b mid b game really easy maybe much time complex guess good compromise oral language yes would heavy task understand worry b meh b game short kinda sad fifth floor panel fifth language deciphered minute pace game quite slow time mostly run walk across level find clue missed least scenery pretty length 10h 100 low replayability price considered bit high

892970,Valheim,"[h1]Valheim[/h1]
...is an open-world crafting survival game. Sent by Odin to the world of Valheim, you must survive by gathering resources, building a shelter, training your skills and crafting equipment to fight the forsaken.

[h1]⚙ [u]Game Description & Mechanics[/u] ⚙[/h1]
As with most crafting survival, everything you eat, wear or build is made of various materials and using various tools made from those materials. You start by gathering branches and rocks from the ground, crafting your first axe, hammer and weapon, which in turn will allow you to gather better, stronger and more varied material, found in areas of increasing difficulty. With each material you find for the first time, new recipes are revealed (from your character remembering their mortal life).

Progress is unlocked through defeating bosses. For instance: [spoiler]defeating Eikthyr will give you Hard Antlers from which to craft your first pickaxe, which in turns will allow you to start gathering your first metal ore.[/spoiler] The game is also separated in areas known as biomes, and it is implied that you avoid biomes beyond your level. You start in Meadows where you will find the first boss, after which you can go in Black Forests where you will find the second boss, and so forth. There is no physical barrier to those biomes beyond the difficulty of the creatures found within, and you should have maxed out your equipment made from material available in your current biome before exploring the next, more difficult biomes.

Your stats consists of health and stamina, which have no permanent increase. The food you eat will increase those base stats temporarily, increase which will steadily decline over time. You are limited to eating three things at any given time, which must be different. You may eat raspberries, mushrooms and cooked meat, but not three cooked meats. You will eventually unlock potion crafting made from fermented mead, giving buffs to poison or cold resistance, or filling your health or stamina.

[h1]☺ [u]What I enjoyed[/u] ☺[/h1]
I must say this game can be pretty laid back. I've read that it incorporates all the strengths of crafting survival games, but none of the weaknesses, and it is pretty much the case. If you don't eat, your health and stamina will be pretty low, you won't regenerate your health and will only slowly regain stamina, but you won't die of hunger. If you want to spend days gathering wood and rocks and building your dream longhouse, then you may ignore eating completely. The same applies to sleeping, being dry or staying warm (except for the freezing temperature of Mountain biomes, that is): your stamina won't regenerate as fast, but you can otherwise ignore it if you're not heading into danger.

But the game is still punishing where it needs to be. If you're cutting down trees and stick around when the trunk is falling towards you, you'll die. If you're climbing on very high rooftops to finish your chimney and fall, you'll die. If you explore Swamps without poison-resistance potions, or Mountains without cold-resistance potions, you'll die, and have no one but yourself to blame. And when you do die, your skills are decreased by 5%, and you lose all your inventory and equipment until you can go back to that location to recover it.

Screenshots won't do it justice. The game uses lighting, fog and weather effects in a superb manner. One morning, you'll be welcomed to a gorgeous sunrise, the next will surround the area in a fog so thick you can barely see an arm's length in front of you, and the next will have windy showers and thunderstorms. It is quite effective at setting the mood, but it will also affect your playthrough. When it rains, you're wet, you don't recover stamina as fast. When it's windy, your boat will get damaged from crashing into high waves.

[h1]☹ [u]What bothered me[/u] ☹[/h1]
While it seems like a good idea to have your crafting progress determined by the bosses, the implications regarding difficulty goes beyond that. There are ""events"" of increasing frequency where your location or base gets attacked, and the difficulty of those events is determined by which boss you've defeated, regardless of how safe is the biome you've settled in. Having boars and necks attack your wooden walls is barely a bother at first, but when multiple trolls are smashing through your stone walls while you just wanted peace and quiet to create a new architectural monument, it gets annoying.

Visuals are pretty, but polygons and resolutions are old-gen looking, reminiscent of late PS1/early PS2 graphics if console gamers want something to compare. Of course, this is an Early Access title, so a stable game with solid and fun gameplay is more important at this stage, but I sure hope this gets taken into consideration further down the development line.

Another thing the game lacks is a high quantity of craftable items. Decorations are few, so constructing a believable mead hall or village is difficult within the confines of the available pieces. The Hearth and Home update, recently delayed further to later this year, cannot come soon enough.

[h1][b]My Early Access Verdict[/b]: ★★★ - [i]""Why wait any longer?""[/i][/h1]

[i]Valheim[/i] deserves the highest rating I can give an Early Access game. I had a lot of fun playing it, especially when a friend established a server for a few of us to hop in and out at our own pace, building and exploring together. Since release, it's been patched to a very stable and bug-free experience. More updates are on their way, slowed down by the extremely high quantity of players giving feedback. Yet, the included content is already enough to have plenty of fun! There's no need to wait for it to come out of Early Access, you can go right ahead and get this one!

703080,Planet Zoo,I like this game. But those dlcs are really expensive.,like game dlcs really expensive
582660,Black Desert,"Note to considering buyers, the $10 price tag is false; you'll probably need to end up spending probably another $20 or so to feel like you're not being hindered in terms of bag space, weight, or auto loot speed. This game is an extremely long term game--there are no gear resets when new content drops. 

So if the idea of getting near to max gear in 2 weeks is what you need to have fun, then this game isn't for you. But the flip side of that though is this, the progression is always there. Concerning the length however, they did add seasonal servers which slingshot new players to a spot where they can actually start working towards end game gear. When this game first came out, you had to go Rags-to-Riches all by your lonesome, but now it's really not the case.

Concerning RNG, I've heard that they have made ways to get around it, but I personally haven't reached that point--but I have been getting some of said items needed to bypass the RNG.

Concerning P2W, it most definetly is possible BUT it is--in my opinion--a complete waste of money due to how inefficient it is. Though players most certainly can--and a small minority do--buy cash shop items and sell them for in-game money, you would probably need to spend no less than $10,000 USD to get anything close to end-game gear from 0. So yeah, whales can exist, but you likely won't encounter them and they make it so we don't need to pay a subscription to keep the servers running.

If you're looking for a game where you can AFK and make some money, love being able to play by yourself for high-end content, having the option for group PvP, and love complicated systems, this game is likely gonna be a good fit.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"Ark survival evolved but on roids, in my opinion a huge upgrade from ASE.
I myself am more of a PvE player, and the open world on the ""rework"" of The Island is absolutely stunning.

In game commands to increase fps cap (Keep in mind, some these commands will make the game look a little weird)

- r.Streaming.PoolSize 0
Unlockes all memory on your GPU

- r.ShadowQuality 0
Disables all shadows

r.VolumeTricCloud 0
Disables the volumetric sky

- r.Nanite.MaxPixelsPerEdge 4
reduces triangles for meshes

- r.Lumen.ScreenProbeGather.RadianceCache.ProbeResolution 16
optimizes lumen

- r.DynamicGlobalIlluminationMethod 2
Disables lumen





tips to increase fps cap
Have all the graphic settings at low, except for view distance and post processing.
You want view distance to be set as medium as well as post processing.
Don't move resolution scale below 82, so you can actually see.

For clarification, this is just ase but with better graphics and a few more mechanics.

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"I completely beat the game thus at this point it doesn't hide any more secrets from me, tho it doesn't change the fact that it had been a huge fun and Hogwarts Legacy was the game I really needed and I don't exclude replaying it in the future as it's become my personal favorite game of the 2023. It's not perfect, but absolutely deserved a positive review!

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]beautiful, addicting world full of satisfying, but often undemanding fights. Using magic was exteremely fun and gave multiple possibilities of having a great combat experience (you can try stealth, defensive plants, potions, choose to learn unforgivable curses or just use mastered spells)
    [*]quite nice character development-you can spend talent points on improving your magic skills and upgrading your equipment items.
    [*]absolutely stunning beasts and landscapes offering tons of activities, side quests, puzzles, exploration
    [*]the Room of Requirements being in general your base [spoiler] where you can prepare your gear, brew potions, grow plants and breed beasts. It can be also decorated both by conjuring items from the collections and by changing its style with the help of your own slave, I mean house elf [/spoiler]
    [*]engaging and fun side quests full of unexpected twists and sometimes heartbreaking situations compensating for the boring main story
    [*]quests unlimited in time or by the main story
    [*]despite not giving actual moral consequences of your actions, in some cases you can get a better reward and/or piss off the NPCs
    [*]large freedom of action
    [*]the possibilities of customizing your character (from their appearance, voice to the gear they use)
    [*]various and interesting side characters, at least some of them
    [*]fun, but again quite simple puzzles
    [*]versatile game for many hours and for every generation. Thanks to the fact that you play as a fifth-grade student, the plot seems more mature and at the same time it gives the opportunity to learn all the basics.
    [*]decent optimization, beautiful graphics and atmospheric music
    [*]great on Steam Deck!
[/list]
[h3]Cons:[/h3]
[list]
    [*]my biggest complaint is in spite of a huge level of immersion, the lack of an actual moral system. We can pour out dark magic all over Hogwarts and no one will even bat an eyelid. And no, we can't be bad per se, just rude. Even if you choose a bad ending [spoiler] and decide to open the repository, except for the mysterious death of Professor Figg, there are no consequences and you can still win the House Cup and be praised for what you've done. There is no penalty for robbing houses or using unforgivable curses. I think the biggest consequence I had was Natty asking calmly BLOODY HELL HOW DID YOU LEARN THIS SPELL [/spoiler]
    [*]choosing a House is a small matter, apart from making friends from your House  faster I suppose or getting an additional quest when it comes to Hufflepuff.
    [*]little varied life at Hogwarts, [spoiler] the first night will be the last you spend in your dorm [/spoiler]. I feel there could be more interactions with fellow students and more activities within the house you belong to (you can't really storage the loots or use your room). Also the character can't sit, so furniture like sofa and chair are just a decoration.
   [*]boring main story. I get you're supposed to feel like a gifted chosen one, but the result was average for me.
    [*]no actual storyline from Ravenclaw
    [*]there could be more potion ingredients etc. so it'd be more complicated to find them
    [*]many NPCs were boring, unlikable and poorly written characters I won't miss, like for example [spoiler] I wasn't even sorry when Figg died [/spoiler]
    [*]no Quidditch (maybe a chance for a DLC in coop in the nearest future?)
    [*]you can't romance Sebastian and Poppy :// but I get, it's a family friendly game
    [*]cutscenes in Ancient Magic and Merlin's Trials spots cannot be skipped
    [*]no photo mode therefore you can't take beautiful screenshots:(

216150,MapleStory,"The game looks and sounds amazing, but I don't think there's anything positive I can say about the gameplay.

Having played for years, I've seen Nexon devolve into a sad Cookie Clicker design philosophy. The game is now designed for you to sit in one place, on one map, holding the attack button for hours on end maybe with one or two other people, then change to a different map every couple levels and repeat the process. Or, heck, just pick one of the new characters with skills designed to kill everything on the screen indefinitely so you can literally AFK, then brag when you reach the max level with your Kanna by AFKing in a town and asking for +Fame because there's nothing else to do in the game but grind.

All character build variety has been removed so there is now only an illusion of player customization. The new content that gets added amounts to too many convoluted collect-a-thon holiday events and non-MMO subgames that no one asked for. Every now and then there's a story arc with animation and subpar English dubbing, which I don't begrudge them for trying, but big dramatic story arcs weren't what made this game popular. New incomplete features are added before old ones they started years ago are finished--the game has two bestiaries right now, both of which are buggy and incomplete. And that's not even to mention the broken quests, redundant maps, and frequent crashes.

No, from a game design standpoint, this is a mess. I'll admit I keep coming back to the game because the nostalgia is strong, but... as a critic delivering a critical analysis, I can't recommend this game.",game look sound amazing think anything positive say gameplay played year seen nexon devolve sad cookie clicker design philosophy game designed sit one place one map holding attack button hour end maybe one two people change different map every couple level repeat process heck pick one new character skill designed kill everything screen indefinitely literally afk brag reach max level kanna afking town asking fame nothing else game grind character build variety removed illusion player customization new content get added amount many convoluted collect thon holiday event non mmo subgames one asked every story arc animation subpar english dubbing begrudge trying big dramatic story arc made game popular new incomplete feature added old one started year ago finished game two bestiary right buggy incomplete even mention broken quest redundant map frequent crash game design standpoint mess admit keep coming back game nostalgia strong critic delivering critical analysis recommend game

2157560,Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising,"Fighting game noob playing on keyboard for 20-ish hours went like this:
1st hour - 'what are these cursed controls, how is this playable'
2nd & 3rd hour - adjusting keybinds and trying stuff out in training mode(can barely do inputs)
4th & 5th hour - goofing around with friends but starting to hit our first combos
6th hour - getting rolled by gamers in online lobbies(Nier ragdolled me for 15 seconds to death)
7-10th hours - finally getting some good wins in there against my better friends and getting familiar with the systems, having a blast learning

and all the rest up to the 20th hour have been my most memorable experiences of this year with my friends, can't wait to play more and I fell in love with the game so much that I had to buy it even though it's ridiculously expensive for someone from an underdeveloped country like me

The free version is very generous and has a big chunk of the content unlocked - most locked things are cosmetics, so I'd recommend it to anyone keen on trying out a fighting game and if you like the art/characters then there's even more to enjoy, as all of them are pretty quirky and have fitting(for their character) interactions with everyone else

Overall a banger of a game and something that reminded me how good it feels to have a proper adrenaline-filled fight, that also gives me a lot of flashy attacks to use or look at",fighting game noob playing keyboard 20 ish hour went like 1st hour cursed control playable 2nd 3rd hour adjusting keybinds trying stuff training mode barely input 4th 5th hour goofing around friend starting hit first combo 6th hour getting rolled gamers online lobby nier ragdolled 15 second death 7 10th hour finally getting good win better friend getting familiar system blast learning rest 20th hour memorable experience year friend wait play fell love game much buy even though ridiculously expensive someone underdeveloped country like free version generous big chunk content unlocked locked thing cosmetic recommend anyone keen trying fighting game like art character even enjoy pretty quirky fitting character interaction everyone else overall banger game something reminded good feel proper adrenaline filled fight also give lot flashy attack use look

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"The game has a good framework around it and great customization options, I've been having fun with it.
The problem is that the more you play, the more you see questionable mechanic decisions, unfinished or unrealized features or down right late game unintuitive logic.

I'm not sure this should've left Early Access, I mean it's playable and it has some bones and meat on it, but it's clear that the scope is not what it should be. They're currently porting the game on consoles and opening new projects so I'm worried that features the game needs might be on the back burner, I would like to see mood actually do something for example, or builder's hut actually build the buildings.
I swear, building everything by hand becomes very tedious after a while, especially if you're like me and you want to give the best houses for your villagers.
Children are useless and bare bones as well, they have like 2 lines and serve no purpose apart from boosting the mood of the family (which again is useless apparently). They take away your female villagers for 2 years so they can be mothers, so that's a dip in your workforce, but it's cool, right? It's an investment, soon the children will be able to help out in the village and the mothers will get back to work.
Hah.
Imagine my surprise when a medieval child cannot work before the age of... 18... seriously?
I've been playing 42 hours and I've played like 5 years? (Will have to check).
I'm not even going to talk about the complete lack of interactions with your villagers except maybe they give you one of the 5 random quests every other villager can.

I feel the game could be much more, an easy way to fix this would be to give the community modding tools, I have tons of ideas how to improve this game and I am sure anyone who played this for at least 20 hours has them as well.
I know, modding shouldn't fix a game, but so much depth and tweaking could be introduced, as I said, the game is pretty good and it has a good framework, but it's just a shadow of something far greater it could be.

If it really inspires you (which it did for me) get it, otherwise I would be cautious and wait, see where this goes, for now it's a bittersweet experience.",game good framework around great customization option fun problem play see questionable mechanic decision unfinished unrealized feature right late game unintuitive logic sure left early access mean playable bone meat clear scope currently porting game console opening new project worried feature game need might back burner would like see mood actually something example builder hut actually build building swear building everything hand becomes tedious especially like want give best house villager child useless bare bone well like 2 line serve purpose apart boosting mood family useless apparently take away female villager 2 year mother dip workforce cool right investment soon child able help village mother get back work hah imagine surprise medieval child work age 18 seriously playing 42 hour played like 5 year check even going talk complete lack interaction villager except maybe give one 5 random quest every villager feel game could much easy way fix would give community modding tool ton idea improve game sure anyone played least 20 hour well know modding fix game much depth tweaking could introduced said game pretty good good framework shadow something far greater could really inspires get otherwise would cautious wait see go bittersweet experience

We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like ""You can no longer use the barber"".

1063730,New World,"Look, I'll admit that when this game first launched, I was hyped. I loved the beta. Crafting felt simple yet meaningful and worthwhile. The real-time combat system appealed to me in ways ESO never could. Some of the locales were visually stunning. I thought it was going places. To be fair, I wasn't wrong, but those places trend sharply in an unflattering direction.

Be warned, I had a lot to say below.

If you're a player whose interest lies almost solely in world PvP, you might find a niche for yourself in this game. If you're a player whose primary goal is to run PvE content with your friends, on the other hand, I guarantee you will be disappointed. This game struggled with an identity crisis from day one, which has yet to be resolved. The developers still want you to believe this is a normal MMO, not an attempt at recreating Guild Wars PvP in disguise. I won't go so far yet as to say it's completely dead and there's no hope of saving it, but the numbers paint a pretty grim picture, as it was already down 90% of its daily concurrent player count within a month or two of launch. It's going to take a lot of serious soul searching, a concrete plan, a ton of work, and a ton of time that they may not have.

Pros: 
- The real time combat, as I mentioned before, feels like an improvement to me over what ESO tried to do. Some of the weapons feel very fluid once you've gained several mastery ranks and put together some semblance of a build. It's not perfect - ranged weapons in particular have some serious lingering problems that will appear later in this list, but it's a solid system at its core.
- Visuals are great. They nailed it here.
- Crafting. I did not have enough good things to say about this during the beta. Gathering isn't as tedious as other MMOs have made it, and rewards you with a reasonable amount of supplies even if you find yourself competing with other people for nodes. The things you can craft feel meaningful, and it's not super difficult to keep it leveling alongside combat for the majority of the game. Obviously that will change at the upper tiers, but that's just something that comes with the territory.

Cons: 
- Population. This game went from one extreme to the other in this sense. There were massive overpopulation and queue issues at launch, which were largely self-inflicted with the servers only supporting 2000 concurrent players, and no cross-world party capability (which is still not a possibility, and to the best of our knowledge, never will). Now, it's underpopulated. Players have consolidated to keep a few servers here and there alive, but most are ghost towns, with some dominated completely by a few companies (AKA guilds). 

Update 02/13/22: At the time of writing this, New World has gone from a million players at launch, to averaging ~70,000 barely four and a half months later. Despite server merges having just happened, the count continues to drop at a fast enough rate that remaining players are already asking for another wave.

- Player-controlled economy. This was a neat idea in theory. Its execution, however, is ruined by the state of the game. Companies control the economy in towns they own, so if a company takes control of a massive portion of the map, they quite simply ruin the experience by bleeding you dry. 

- PvP-driven PvE. This is something I have hated in any MMO. Decisions on content are influenced first and foremost by PvP, because it's clear AGS wanted this to be a PvP game and threw a PvE veneer over it to lure more people in for the money. If you're a PvE player, your weapons will be nerfed if enough PvP players complain that it's doing too much to them, regardless of how badly that affects the content you're playing.

- Poor AI/pathing. This is where the issues with ranged weapons come into play. AI enemy movement is so jerky and rigid that you'll find them twitching out of your shots constantly. Instead of simply turning around, they will take a circuitous and unpredictable path to walk in a pseudo-circle until they're facing you. When they reach you, they'll randomly move laterally for no reason at all. Sometimes this benefits you because they'll be attacking and will miss because of the strange movement. Most of the time, it just screws with you instead.

- Balance issues. The game claims to offer variety with its armor types, but the truth is that unless you're wearing heavy armor, you're going to suffer. There is no shortage of enemies that are capable of covering great distances with their attacks, and stagger against you is abysmally bad. Don't be surprised if you find yourself stun locked on a regular basis after mistiming one dodge.

- Content. Or lack thereof. There is no real endgame to speak of. There's a PvPvE activity called Outpost Rush that you can endlessly farm, and there is a 60 zone you can grind, but for a PvE player there's no purpose to it. There's nothing to do with that fancy gear you're farming, and in the 3+ months this game has been out, nothing has been added to it except for one new weapon type, and one new enemy type that only spawns in very specific locations. Part of that is because of....

- Endless bugs. AGS has been constantly busy, seemingly just creating a new major bug every time they supposedly patch another. 

- Communication. This has been bad far more frequently than it's been good. When it happens, timelines are often extremely vague. On one particular day, the AWS backbone went down for the entire East region, causing massive issues across far more than just New World. Not many might have been aware of this, however, because a large number of services NOT named Amazon were the visibly affected ones. Instead of making people aware of this, and providing a link to their parent company's status page, AGS simply stated ""We're down"" in the morning, then was silent for 8 hours following. There has never even been a roadmap made available to even indicate a general short or long term plan for the game. Either they don't know where to go from here, or there are just that many issues to work on, that they don't have time to figure out a plan for the future. Either way - not good.

I know this was a lot to sift through, and if you actually read through this whole thing, I'm impressed. In the end, though, the TL;DR version is just that I can't recommend even trying this game unless you exist to play PvP content. PvE is extremely buggy and lackluster, and PvP-favorable updates will always take priority.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"As someone who enjoyed the original House Flipper game and put roughly 300 hours into it, I can't in full honesty give a positive recommendation on this sequel in it's current state. While some QoL additions have been a breath of fresh air (such as changing the details on furnishings with the scanner), I'm also getting major EA flashbacks of features intentionally left out in order to sell DLC at a later date.

Why are there also so many missing items that I would expect a base game to have?

- No Before/After shots like the first game had, giving players a sense of accomplishment to see their work from start to finish.
- Why do the walls still look dirty and have uneven paint strokes if I just finished 100% cleaning and re-painting them? There's no reason for the walls to have a crappy texture if I've already done everything possible to upgrade them aside from building new walls entirely.
- Missing Window Shades/Blinds
- Missing Window Curtains
- Missing Full-floor Carpets
- Anything Lawn Care (Every yard is a mess and it's obvious they're planning to add DLC for this again as with the first game.)
- Very little options for furnishings in the store

I also have serious complaints about the hammer (not sledgehammer) used in Assemble mode. Why give us the option to rotate the camera and change our field of view if the hammer doesn't auto-orientate with it? When trying to hammer in pegs, etc. from a different angle than originally, you end up with inverted movements that are very tiresome and annoying when trying to meet a challenge time limit. Not to mention how your head is just shoved into the building field of view, making movement with Ctrl to improve vision extremely painful and giving the player tunnel vision.

I used to play The Sims and haven't touched an EA game in years due to of how they've treated their player base and how much they've gutted from their games to make an extra few pennies. Unless some serious changes are addressed to the noted above, I won't be purchasing any further titles from this line in the future.",someone enjoyed original house flipper game put roughly 300 hour full honesty give positive recommendation sequel current state qol addition breath fresh air changing detail furnishing scanner also getting major ea flashback feature intentionally left order sell dlc later date also many missing item would expect base game shot like first game giving player sense accomplishment see work start finish wall still look dirty uneven paint stroke finished 100 cleaning painting reason wall crappy texture already done everything possible upgrade aside building new wall entirely missing window shade blind missing window curtain missing full floor carpet anything lawn care every yard mess obvious planning add dlc first game little option furnishing store also serious complaint hammer sledgehammer used assemble mode give u option rotate camera change field view hammer auto orientate trying hammer peg etc different angle originally end inverted movement tiresome annoying trying meet challenge time limit mention head shoved building field view making movement ctrl improve vision extremely painful giving player tunnel vision used play sims touched ea game year due treated player base much gutted game make extra penny unless serious change addressed noted purchasing title line future

2073850,THE FINALS,"I want to recommend. This game is so much fun. Until cheaters... Nearly every match now. But the devs don't want to region lock China because it ""is xenophobic"".

Region locking China has NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE. The Chinese culture does not see ""cheating"" as ""cheating"" like Western culture does. If you are smart enough to get a leg up on an opponent, then you deserve it. To them, it's intelligent, not cheating. Either stop giving BS excuses or stop being so damned sensitive. You could be black, white, brown, yellow, green, blue, purple, etc. - if you're born and raised in China you would have the same cultural stance. 

Let the cheaters play with cheaters; because to their culture there's nothing wrong with it. Stop MAKING US PLAY WITH THEM.

--Edit: Hot damn, I cannot stress this enough: cultural differences exist. They're not wrong, they just exist. The Chinese ""Art of War"" cultural viewpoint isn't wrong. It's different. It's OKAY to respect the difference in cultures around the world while realizing it doesn't mesh with other cultures. This has nothing to do with race. Stop watering the word ""racism"" down, it means absolutely nothing now because it's been so overused.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"CONTROLS AND ADVICE FOR THE BEGINNER!!

Very slow start (but worth it - its actually very well made) but it doesn't give you really any context on how the controls work so ill lay some out here. 

Q - quick crafting menu where you can lay out buildings and craft tools. 

Tab gets you to the main control areas for skill trees and what not but its still confusing especially when your starting out. 

P - Changes to third person perspective

ALT - Holding it activates Sense (uses stamina)

Things to note:

Winter is harsh, if you dont want to be running around constantly making torches to keep from freezing or just stand in your house next to fire waiting for the season to end youll need fur clothes (no way are you going to be able to make these in your first year or even 3 years properly. My advice! head to Hornica, make loads of knives and sell them to the seamstress, you can buy fur clothes from her that will make winter alot more manageable. 

Health - Health doesn't recover really until the season ends where you gain all your food water and health back. Chicory plants regain points of health and St Johns wart cures poisoning. Horde these plants to keep you safe on the road. 

Resources - Wood is pretty self explanatory - grab sticks and stone off the ground (use Q menu to make an axe) chop chop chop! boom you have logs. 
Other resources aren't so obvious - STRAW! part of the main resources you will use in your building. You will find straw in the form of Reeds along the river bank. Dont need a tool to get them but they sometimes are difficult to find. Whenever you do find a source stay close by because your gonna need it. TRUST ME!
Later in the game you start farming and mining for other things like bronze but really you'll fall into understanding these a bit more as you play. Main things are Food - Hunting, Water - River/streams/well, Straw - River bank as reeds, Wood - Trees, Rocks - on the ground or if you make a pickaxe, in the ground. 

There are bandits and they do come after you if your near them (Sometimes somehow knowing your there even when your stealthy) RUN! maybe try to pick them off at a distance but you wont have enough spears to carry that on. 

Animals will charge you especially if you attack so be prepared. 

Weapons - In the early days the best your gonna get is a wooden spear. This works well for hunting small game and you will find trap making inside of the decorations part of your radial menu when hitting Q. 
goal though is to make the hunters lodge - here you can finally make a bow and arrows BUT you need linen thread (NOT EASY TO GET EARLY GAME) - Remember the seamstress of Hornica from earlier? she sells it so make knives sell and buy linen thread. 

Make sure you get hunters sense and survival sense as quickly as possible and hold ALT to activate it, it highlights loads of environment stuff like rocks, sticks etc - just makes it easier. 

Village citizens - Eventually your gonna start adding people to your village and if your like me you do this far too early. Once you do invite people you'll probably be hit immediately by annoying tags in the top left corner tell you how much your citizen needs and is missing in the village. 
My advice! - Make a house for yourself. Make a house for your new citizen before you invite them and make a hunters lodge and well and assign them to one of them. then the next citizen you get to the other. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: When you assign a worker to a station ie, hunters lodge - they will need equipment to do there job like knives - pop them in the hunters lodge box and they'll start working. You can find what they need from the management section when pressing tab, click on the work station and it'll tell you what they need to perform the function you want them to do. 
THE MORE VILLAGERS YOU HAVE THE HIGHER YOUR TAX AT THE END OF THE YEAR!

Quests - Some quests are timed for the season you got them, make sure you check in the tab menu before sleeping for another season and losing it. Having said that - some quests have you travelling a long way for little gain so don't be afraid to give up on one or two if you cant be bothered. 

Travel - Most if not all of the time your gonna be walking to get anywhere, but eventually you will have a horse and i'm sure it'll make it easier but in the early days if you find yourself with a lot of coin and a wish to venture somewhere distant you can use the travelling cart outside all villages to hire a carriage. (i haven't done it as its really expensive but just in case you wanted to)

Just some things to consider but i absolutely recommend the game and you'll find yourself quite invested if you make it past the first year. Sorry for the long review but i had a long journey trying to figure out the mechanics and i'm still learning and didn't fancy buying the guide. 

All the best!

899770,Last Epoch,"Normally I wouldn't recommend an Early Access game, but this one is far cheaper than the quality would warrant, and thus, worthy of an exception. Last Epoch already offers solid ARPG gameplay with lots of great core systems. 

The crafting and endgame systems in particular are incredible. It's a breath of fresh air after having dealt with Path of Exile's increasingly grindy and bloated nonsense over the years. I love that rare items only have 2 suffixes and 2 prefixes, which limits the top end power of rare items. Last Epoch allows you to craft in a semi-deterministic manner without the risk of completely breaking your item. You can pretty much guarantee that you get the mods you want on your items, but getting the highest tiers of those mods is subject to randomness with diminishing returns.

The endgame lets you quickly jump into somewhat short maps with a single objective, while building a web of modifiers on them that increase difficulty and reward for the next few maps, and simultaneously fill up a stability bar that lets you engage a boss and move on to the next tier of endgame maps. Much like the crafting, the system is relatively simple, but powerful and satisfying. The difficulty starts out fairly easy, but can scale all the way up to level 100(the character max level) and beyond, so there is content to challenge even the strongest character builds.

In terms of complexity Last Epoch hits the sweet spot between Diablo 3 and Path of Exile. There is great depth to the builds and skill customization, but it's reasonably streamlined, so you can go in blind and experiment on your own. You don't have to spend thousands of hours doing tedious research to create a functional character and get to the endgame. The gameplay is slower and more controlled than Path of Exile, without feeling sluggish. You can actually see what the monsters and bosses are doing, and move out of the way of dangerous attacks. It is fair, and challenging, and you will probably die a few times while learning certain encounters, but you can always just try again without having to arbitrarily farm some randomly dropped item to access the boss again.

Last Epoch has some incredible quality of life features that puts other games in the genre to shame. The in-game loot filter editor is both powerful and intuitive, so you can decide which items you want shown for each individual character. Skill and passive respeccs are very accessible so you can experiment with different builds. Almost any question you could have about game mechanics can be looked up in-game through a nice game guide menu. The tooltips of skills will tell you which item stats you can use to scale their power. There is a target dummy in town so you can test your build's damage numbers.

Last Epoch is still in a fairly early stage of development, but it has already come a long way, and at this rate it is on pace to become a true competitor and rival to both Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2.

The graphics on this game.... hoh, boy... phenomenal for the animals...

Sound?  Good music that does not get too repetitive and very lifelike ""calls"" from the animals when you zoom in on them.  Animal behaviors are also incredibly realistic (other than the flow on animals climbing things or walking through objects that occurs if you're watching them close-up).

Game also comes equipped with useful tutorial scenarios (the ones my girls are doing for what is ostensibly ""their"" game) and a full-blown in-game career story arc that is also as challenging as you want it to be.

2344520,Diablo® IV,"My Dearest Lilith,

I hope this message finds you in the darkest of spirits, for I have grim news to share regarding the abomination that is Diablo 4, and the wretched state of the company that birthed it. Blizzard, a once-respected titan of the gaming industry, has fallen from grace, and it is my somber duty to detail the horrors that have befallen our beloved Sanctuary.

Blizzard, once known for its commitment to quality and player satisfaction, has devolved into a pit of corporate avarice, and their actions are enough to make demons shudder. The release of Diablo 4 was marred by a litany of controversies, my dear Lilith. The development process was plagued by mismanagement and delays, a reflection of the company's descent into chaos. It is as if they have forsaken their very soul in pursuit of profit.

The Battle.net platform, once a haven for our dark adventures, has been desecrated. It is now plagued by connectivity issues, rampant cheating, and an inordinate amount of microtransactions. It's a far cry from the sinister elegance of our time together, and I cannot help but lament the loss of its former glory.

And as for the wretched entity known as Activision, they have become the devil's own assistant, indeed. Their influence over Blizzard is unmistakable. Microtransactions, loot boxes, and other nefarious schemes have taken root, tarnishing the pure essence of gaming with their profane touch. Our beloved Sanctuary has become a marketplace for virtual trinkets, rather than a realm of terror and dark exploration.

And yet, Lilith, the lamentable news doesn't end there. Microsoft's involvement is nothing short of adding fuel to the infernal fire. While they may have saved other entities from similar fates, it seems that even their dark magic is powerless against the dumpster fire that is Blizzard Games. The unholy alliance with Microsoft cannot undo the damage that has been done, and it's clear that the company is beyond redemption.

my dearest Lilith, the Diablo 4 you once knew and loved has been corrupted beyond recognition. The company behind it, Blizzard, is but a shadow of its former self, a puppet of Activision, and even the might of Microsoft is insufficient to quell the flames of discontent. I mourn the loss of our dark adventures and the sanctuary that has become a mockery of its former glory.

Yours in despair,
Adam",dearest lilith hope message find darkest spirit grim news share regarding abomination diablo 4 wretched state company birthed blizzard respected titan gaming industry fallen grace somber duty detail horror befallen beloved sanctuary blizzard known commitment quality player satisfaction devolved pit corporate avarice action enough make demon shudder release diablo 4 marred litany controversy dear lilith development process plagued mismanagement delay reflection company descent chaos forsaken soul pursuit profit battle net platform dark adventure desecrated plagued connectivity issue rampant cheating inordinate amount microtransactions far cry sinister elegance time together help lament loss former glory wretched entity known activision become devil assistant indeed influence blizzard unmistakable microtransactions loot box nefarious scheme taken root tarnishing pure essence gaming profane touch beloved sanctuary become marketplace virtual trinket rather realm terror dark exploration yet lilith lamentable news end microsoft involvement nothing short adding fuel infernal fire may saved entity similar fate seems even dark magic powerless dumpster fire blizzard game unholy alliance microsoft undo damage done clear company beyond redemption dearest lilith diablo 4 knew loved corrupted beyond recognition company behind blizzard shadow former self puppet activision even might microsoft insufficient quell flame discontent mourn loss dark adventure sanctuary become mockery former glory despair adam

[h1][b]This is for the people who brought the starter edition... [spoiler]like me.[/spoiler][/b][/h1]

If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.

[*][b]Sledge[/b] - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  
[*][b]Thermite[/b] - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.

[*][b]Ash[/b] - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...
[*][b]Twitch[/b] - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.[/list]

[h1][u]And now, for the defending team[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][url=https://youtu.be/F-6ZkbVpTcU][b]Rook[/b][/url] - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...
[*][b]Bandit[/b] - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/hkLUOuE_-5I]Did I also mention he had to deal [b]DRUGS?[/b][/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Jager[/b] - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  
[*][b]Smoke[/b] - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  [spoiler][b][url=https://youtu.be/8MHk0WwrzgY]WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?[/url][/b][/spoiler]
[*][b]Mute[/b] - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  [/list]

[h1][u]Honorable Mentions[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Hibana[/b] - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  [/list]

216150,MapleStory,"Imagine being a game company so obsessed with robbing and abusing their players you take out an item with a specific mechanic that by law is regulated to a certain degree due to it's gambling nature and ability to be bought with real money and replace it with the ability to make use of the same mechanic with in-game currency PURELY to get around those legal  regulations, this is Nexon. Imagine being a game company so obsessed with instilling the idea of ""FOMO"" and time-gates upon it's player base, PURELY in order to further down the line exploit them financially with the ability to bypass said time-gates in order to alleviate said ""FOMO"", this is Nexon.
LIke a lot of us here I have been on (and off) Maplestory for the last 17-18 years now, mostly due to the nostalgia I have tied to this game, there are however overall enjoyable experiences in day to day playing and I believe a lot of this is tied to their F2P server Reboot. Reboot offers a F2P experience where progression is free at the cost of being slower, the need to buy the games main progression mechanic (cubes) only costs in game currency (which has increased rates 6x that of Regular), and overall is mostly a solo experience as trades between players and characters are not enabled. It has become increasingly more noticeable that these positives have been slowly MANUFACTURED to destroy the interest in their F2P server to regain interest in their P2W server, and yesterday it was announced and confirmed that this was the case with their replacing of cubes with meso cost, the increase of the cost to now reroll potentials, the nerf of Reboot meso rates by at least 5x and introducing a DAILY CAP ON MESO OBTAINED DAILY, the now MOST VALUABLE IN-GAME ITEM. 
These changes leave Reboot in a state that is almost unplayable and removes all incentive for playing Reboot over Regular as currently only Regular allows trading gear and items between charaters and players, and after the change THIS will be the ONLY difference between the two server. Regular and Reboot will be the same besides: the P2W elements being non existent in Reboot, and Regular having the trading of items between characters and players. Reboot players will be increasingly restricted while those on Regular will now be delighted; as the money they were spending on cubes through Nexon's Cash Shop can now just go to buying either Maplepoints or Meso through meso sellers cutting out Nexon entirely.  I have witnessed this developer employ the most predatory and malicious practices of any game I have ever played whilst consistently making changes to the game making it inherently worse because they are too lazy to actually address the proper issues and comply by LEGAL REGULATIONS. While I made excuses and tried to joke and cope about the state of Nexon and this game throughout the years, because I have sincerely enjoyed a lot of the experience and my time here, if these changes being implemented in KMS get brought to GMS I can no longer sit here and justify my time in game or the support of Nexon as a game developer.

892970,Valheim,"Valheim really nails a lot of things that the survival genre sometimes struggles with:

The sandbox gameplay that never rushes you is balanced with a meaningful progression system that keeps you fixed on certain goals and milestones.

Acquiring and consuming better food makes you more capable in combat and exploration, but you will never simply drop dead due to hunger, making sustenance feel more like a reward than a nagging requirement.

The building system is rewarding.  Your shelters must be constructed with adequate support and ventilation of smoke in mind, and interior comforts increase the amount of rest you gain, incentivizing you to not just build a house, but a nice house.

You can construct paired portals to fast travel across the map, but certain raw materials cannot be carried through them, which creates interesting logistical choices between shipping materials over long distances by cart or by boat, and building outposts to process and craft your materials closer to where they are mined.  Additionally, certain crops can only grow in certain biomes, which further incentivizes setting up multiple bases.  Thankfully, the rewarding nature of the building system makes the prospect of building a new base an opportunity rather than a burden.

Like most games in this genre, a good amount of time is spent gathering resources, but the amount you need never seems onerous.  It can be time consuming, but this is often because you will get interrupted by monsters drawn to the sound of mining ore and chopping trees, which breaks up what could otherwise be a monotonous task.

And lastly, the game's unique graphical style is gorgeous.  Low polygon counts and simple textures free up resources that are spent on beautiful lighting, atmospherics, and color composition.

This type of open-world survival/building game isn't for everyone.  It's heavy on atmosphere, but light on story, and there are some routine repetitive tasks involved.  But if you've ever enjoyed another game in this genre, or are curious and looking for one to start on, Valheim strikes an amazing balance that accentuates the genre's strengths while minimizing its inherent flaws.",valheim really nail lot thing survival genre sometimes struggle sandbox gameplay never rush balanced meaningful progression system keep fixed certain goal milestone acquiring consuming better food make capable combat exploration never simply drop dead due hunger making sustenance feel like reward nagging requirement building system rewarding shelter must constructed adequate support ventilation smoke mind interior comfort increase amount rest gain incentivizing build house nice house construct paired portal fast travel across map certain raw material carried creates interesting logistical choice shipping material long distance cart boat building outpost process craft material closer mined additionally certain crop grow certain biome incentivizes setting multiple base thankfully rewarding nature building system make prospect building new base opportunity rather burden like game genre good amount time spent gathering resource amount need never seems onerous time consuming often get interrupted monster drawn sound mining ore chopping tree break could otherwise monotonous task lastly game unique graphical style gorgeous low polygon count simple texture free resource spent beautiful lighting atmospherics color composition type open world survival building game everyone heavy atmosphere light story routine repetitive task involved ever enjoyed another game genre curious looking one start valheim strike amazing balance accentuates genre strength minimizing inherent flaw
230410,Warframe,"Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I've wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. 
I'll just write a short and simple review.

Combat - 8/10
Really satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.

Movement - 7/10
Mostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.

Multiplayer - 5/10
Great in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.

Story - ?/10
I don't have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I've seen thus far is pretty interesting.

Visuals - 8,5/10
Absolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It's so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.

Missions and objectives- 5/10
This is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you're really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would've prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I've already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I'll add that I'm not a fan of grinding (which is why I've spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you're into that stuff but I'm not.


Keep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences. Correct me on anything that's wrong and feel free to share your thoughts with me.

1599340,Lost Ark,"After hours of my life on this game... I've come to the sad conclusion that it can't be enjoyed.
The only thing I enjoy in this game is raiding with my friends if not for them I would have quit long ago.. I was going to put a list of pros and cons like most reviews but I am finding it hard to come up with pros aside from playing with friends but not everyone has friends that can play around the same times they can.. so I will just post the cons.

1. [Gate keeping] Players gate keep for everything in this game.. Items / your I level / your roster level / your class / your title / your pet / your card set / The crazy part is I don't blame them 1 bit because the game encourages it.. I mean think about it if you can get your raids done faster why would you not? it is not like you get anything for spending time with new players in fact you lose all the way around.. your time to play / your items / sanity.. even playing with friends can be hard because if someone has a hiccup you all die in raids and raiding is a must.. that brings me to number 2 below

2. [The Community] is very predatory you will be kicked from raids for messing up sometimes even once is enough and it don't matter if you are a new player or not..now what I mean by predatory is the high level players often sell buses to low level players or players that don't want to take the time to learn and them same high level players make alts that they use to sabotage other players raids so they can sell them buses to stay ahead in the game.. this has no sign of going away because 1 players mistakes costs everyone in raids and late game gear is locked behind them same raids.

3. [Honing] You have to hone your gear in this game to unlock content and the cost is insane.. just as an example I had an alt cost me over 250.000 gold just to gain 15 I levels.. 1475 to 1490.. you need 1490 to gain access to a raid called brelshaza.. and I didn't even count the gold I spent on getting the gear I needed to raid 60.000 which you need or you will be subjected to gate keeping.. this is over a months worth of gold raiding as a F2P player with 5 alts doing all of your raids weekly.. dealing with hard raids and a toxic community that won't let you learn unless you have friends to play with.. If I am being honest the raids are not even that hard but the community being toxic / rage quitting / sabotaging / makes them hard.. some light to raiding is they are nerfing how hard some of the raids are however they are also taking some of the gold you make out of them raids making it harder to hone up to the levels you need to get into higher level raids.

4. [Dead content] The game is filled with side quests in the form of islands you go to some of which have important things such as skill potions you need for your characters... I think it is an awesome idea to give players more to do in game.. however most of them islands need a group of players and can't be done solo.. so in the end the players that started when the game was released got to enjoy some of them islands until the player base got what they needed and the content died leaving new players or players that didn't focus on that content left out.

5. [Raiding] I like raids with my friends however some of my friends are not that good at raiding and don't have much time to sit and learn for hours so what ends up happening is we take time out to teach each other the raids this costs us entry into the higher level raids we need to progress and the items we have to use during learning time...overall setting us back weeks in progress cause raids can only be done weekly making it hard to enjoy teaching your friends or new players new raids and adding to the gate keeping that is already crazy in this game.. it is hard to keep raiding as a friends group cause honing can be lucky or unlucky setting you back or ahead not to mention time difference work / school schedule then the entry system I mentioned above... this leaves your friends or new players at the mercy of a toxic predatory community making raiding not enjoyable and gate keeping players progress stopping them from obtaining the gold/gear they need to progress in the game.

6. [Trading] Trading is locked behind a system that uses coins called pheons like a tax pheons are also used to buy your meta gear off the market however the cost is high making you not want to trade with players so you have the pheons to buy the meta gear you need to raid so you are not getting gate kept... not to mention you also can't send your alt characters gear that would be good for them cause it will still cost you pheons and pheons cost real money... pheons was a system put in place to stop bots from farming gear and trading it so that a market could exist however it stops players from helping friends or new players from obtaining the gear they need to progress driving market prices up and promoting gate keeping.

7. [Bussing] Bus/carry players.. I don't think Bussing overall is a bad thing sometimes players don't have the time to do raids on all 6 characters or they are being gate kept by the community however Bussing becomes bad when players take advantage of newer players by charging them crazy amounts of gold to pass a raid stopping them from having gold to hone and progress also stopping them from making gold by learning the raids creating a grey area where they have to pay to play or quit because depending on how long they have been bussing they will be so far behind that no one will want to help them learn or catch up leaving them gate kept.

8. [Time spent] Overall all sometimes it feels like the community traps players into playing so you don't fall behind... by gate keeping players with low roster levels or lack of titles from raids they need to progress making it so time off of the game hurts... not to mention it takes weeks/months to get the gold you need to build a meta character.. the game itself encourages you to make alt characters so you can level up your roster faster and so you will have more raids to do for gold but again this takes a lot of time to get done.. you have to take into account the fact it will cost gold to build every alt character you make before you can even use them to make gold cutting into even more of your time..not to mention each of them characters will be gate kept at some point making it take more time to get the gear they need from raids.. if you plan on playing every alt you make for profit the game will feel like a job and take up crazy amounts of your time... if you don't you will be gate kept for not having a high enough roster level and your progress will slow.

I can't recommend it to any new players knowing what I know after 1640 hours into playing...1. Raids need to be nerfed so players can't sabotage new players in hopes of selling buses... also so new players stand a chance at learning not just being kicked from party's and to cut down on the time it takes to raid when you have 6 characters to raid on. / 2. Honing cost is still way to high for a game that is losing ways to make gold Rapport/Raids / 3. Pheons have to go they don't stop bots they drive up the market and encourage gate keeping / 4. side content like the islands should be solo friendly for players that don't play much or don't have 7 friends on standby for when they do have time to play it especially since that content is important for progress / 5. Overall time it takes to get daily's done needs to be reduced as it is essential for roster level and character growth it takes way to much time to even think about side content when you have to do daily's on 6 characters / 6. Remove the ability to view other players roster levels to prevent gate keeping / 7. Remove entry costs from raids so players don't get punished for helping new players or friends learn... instead of promoting bussing / gate keeping / 8. Fix the engravings system so it has engravings we can actually use instead of just more excuses to gate keep players.",hour life game come sad conclusion enjoyed thing enjoy game raiding friend would quit long ago going put list pro con like review finding hard come pro aside playing friend everyone friend play around time post con 1 gate keeping player gate keep everything game item level roster level class title pet card set crazy part blame 1 bit game encourages mean think get raid done faster would like get anything spending time new player fact lose way around time play item sanity even playing friend hard someone hiccup die raid raiding must brings number 2 2 community predatory kicked raid messing sometimes even enough matter new player mean predatory high level player often sell bus low level player player want take time learn high level player make alt use sabotage player raid sell bus stay ahead game sign going away 1 player mistake cost everyone raid late game gear locked behind raid 3 honing hone gear game unlock content cost insane example alt cost 250 000 gold gain 15 level 1475 1490 need 1490 gain access raid called brelshaza even count gold spent getting gear needed raid 60 000 need subjected gate keeping month worth gold raiding f2p player 5 alt raid weekly dealing hard raid toxic community let learn unless friend play honest raid even hard community toxic rage quitting sabotaging make hard light raiding nerfing hard raid however also taking gold make raid making harder hone level need get higher level raid 4 dead content game filled side quest form island go important thing skill potion need character think awesome idea give player game however island need group player done solo end player started game released got enjoy island player base got needed content died leaving new player player focus content left 5 raiding like raid friend however friend good raiding much time sit learn hour end happening take time teach raid cost u entry higher level raid need progress item use learning time overall setting u back week progress cause raid done weekly making hard enjoy teaching friend new player new raid adding gate keeping already crazy game hard keep raiding friend group cause honing lucky unlucky setting back ahead mention time difference work school schedule entry system mentioned leaf friend new player mercy toxic predatory community making raiding enjoyable gate keeping player progress stopping obtaining gold gear need progress game 6 trading trading locked behind system us coin called pheons like tax pheons also used buy meta gear market however cost high making want trade player pheons buy meta gear need raid getting gate kept mention also send alt character gear would good cause still cost pheons pheons cost real money pheons system put place stop bot farming gear trading market could exist however stop player helping friend new player obtaining gear need progress driving market price promoting gate keeping 7 bussing bus carry player think bussing overall bad thing sometimes player time raid 6 character gate kept community however bussing becomes bad player take advantage newer player charging crazy amount gold pas raid stopping gold hone progress also stopping making gold learning raid creating grey area pay play quit depending long bussing far behind one want help learn catch leaving gate kept 8 time spent overall sometimes feel like community trap player playing fall behind gate keeping player low roster level lack title raid need progress making time game hurt mention take week month get gold need build meta character game encourages make alt character level roster faster raid gold take lot time get done take account fact cost gold build every alt character make even use make gold cutting even time mention character gate kept point making take time get gear need raid plan playing every alt make profit game feel like job take crazy amount time gate kept high enough roster level progress slow recommend new player knowing know 1640 hour playing 1 raid need nerfed player sabotage new player hope selling bus also new player stand chance learning kicked party cut time take raid 6 character raid 2 honing cost still way high game losing way make gold rapport raid 3 pheons go stop bot drive market encourage gate keeping 4 side content like island solo friendly player play much 7 friend standby time play especially since content important progress 5 overall time take get daily done need reduced essential roster level character growth take way much time even think side content daily 6 character 6 remove ability view player roster level prevent gate keeping 7 remove entry cost raid player get punished helping new player friend learn instead promoting bussing gate keeping 8 fix engraving system engraving actually use instead excuse gate keep player

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. 

Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.

Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points. 
    -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop). 
   -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.
   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics. 
   -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. 

There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course. 
   The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level. 
  -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of ""inner darkness of your soul"" but a fun one and useful. 
  - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking. 
  -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. 
Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.

With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS. 
  -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona. 
  -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.
Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. 

And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!
This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying.
 Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS. 
  -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style. 
  -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. 


Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!
 
World Building! 

Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. 

Questing! 

From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.

Music!

The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. 

Community!
It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.


And that is all I can think of. If you have read this far, thank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it. Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game!

1151340,Fallout 76,"I became a big fan of Fallout 4 after my grandson talked me into getting the game. I delayed on Fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure PVP wasn't an issue (not a fan). And I have to say there are a lot of positive things with Fallout 76. I also waited for them to do major updates etc. I do enjoy the mission...lengthy though they be. I'm a slow player (almost 70 years old).  Having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but I understand why....so..not too bad. Building isn't quite as much as in Fallout 4 though you can do a lot as you choose. I do wish combat was more along the Farcry 4,5 type....where you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies. But overall if you are a Fallout  fan you should enjoy this game. Graphics are good, they corrected a crashing issue, continue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play. I don't pay extra for 'Fallout 1st' (monthly fee) which gives you some nice benefits,...and while I could afford it...well I haven't paid a monthly subscription since my wow days. Like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of events, dailies etc to mix up game play. So I do recommend it being an overall Fallout fan. Happy gaming all...be kind.",became big fan fallout 4 grandson talked getting game delayed fallout 76 price drop insure pvp issue fan say lot positive thing fallout 76 also waited major update etc enjoy mission lengthy though slow player almost 70 year old move around server camp emplacement pain understand bad building quite much fallout 4 though lot choose wish combat along farcry 4 5 type chance truly sneak camp remove baddie overall fallout fan enjoy game graphic good corrected crashing issue continue add content change support different style play pay extra fallout 1st monthly fee give nice benefit could afford well paid monthly subscription since wow day like game mission tedious lot event daily etc mix game play recommend overall fallout fan happy gaming kind

1172620,Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition,"When I hit 10 hours of gameplay, I said I would write a review. Then it was 100 hours. 250. 500. Finally, I told myself if I could play 1,000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game (Nov 25th, 2020), I would write the review. Here I am delivering that promise early. So, do I recommend Sea of Thieves? Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played. Amongst my crew, there has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a game, but more a lifestyle. If you fall in love with this game like me, you will fully understand what this means. But is Sea of Thieves right for you?

I. What is Sea of Thieves?
Sea of Thieves is an adventure sandbox game where you craft your own adventure -- where no two play sessions are ever the same. One day you could be running Gold Hoarders, doing X marks the spot maps, hopping island to island in search of glittering gold. Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollow, the water turns black. The Kraken. The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a f*****g ancient goblet. The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpected.

The nature of Sea of Thieves is PvPvE. This means that you will have emergent threats like Skeleton Ships, Megalodons, or the fearsome Kraken. There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasure, Ashen Winds where you fight a fiery boss, and skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test; however, there is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure. It cannot be avoided, you will run into other players in Sea of Thieves. (PvE servers will never happen.)

Player interactions can be the most amazing moments, or events that cause you to break your keyboard. I have met great friends, amazing communities, and some of the most salty, homophobic, and racist individuals to walk the planet. I don’t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones. If you do have a really toxic encounter, I highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare (their support system is one of a kind). 

II. Is Sea of Thieves Right for You?
Do you want to be a pirate? Do you love adventure? Do you have friends to play with? Then this game is absolutely for you. While it is not required to have other players to play the game, it is much more enjoyable with company. My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened. With friends, you will write your stories of gold and glory. On the other side, I am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop. This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate. Beware though, you will sink. A lot.

“Sink or be Sunk”. Remember these words when playing this game. You will sink other ships, but you will also sink. No one is immune. Sea of Thieves can be a rough game, but if you get good at the game, it is one of the most satisfying feelings possible. Everyone starts somewhere, and you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to ‘get good’. Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training you.

If you are the type of player that enjoys griefing and/or using hate speech, then please move on. As mentioned before, Rare does not mess around with player reports. I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast (the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended). I will find you, and clip you, and report you, and then hunt you down until you leave the server. That is a promise.

III. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Well?
Graphics: 
The graphics in Sea of Thieves are just stunning. It is the most beautiful game, nay art, I have ever seen. I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water. There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon. I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves. Your pirate might look a little weird, but you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond. I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very much. 

The World:
In the game you will visit different regions of the Sea of Thieves that all have their own look and personality. You may go to The Wilds which looks gloomy and eerie with the worst storms in the game, or the Devil’s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships. You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty. Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the “story mode” Tall Tales. The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alive, with water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel faster. 

IV. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Wrong?
Hit reg:
""In areas of intense action, players may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets. While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updates, we are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience.” Expect to see this forever.

Bugs/Glitches:
With any game there are things that need to be ironed out, and Sea of Thieves is not spared from that. I have been rocket launched off a capstan, had a meg flip my ship six tiles North on death, been stuck in emotes to crewmates (this one is actually really amazing). You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game. Beware to Steam players though, every other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab out/in, there is a 3 second delay each way. 

V. Conclusion/ TLDR
Sea of Thieves is the adventure that you make of it. You will sink, and you will learn from the times you get sunk. Never give up, because there is no other game like Sea of Thieves. It truly is the best game ever made. As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey says, “It’s not about the Gold. It’s about the Glory.” May the wind be in all your sails.
10/10 Must Buy.

What was Hour 1,000 Day like?
I thought it important to describe what Hour 1,000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me. My crew mate and I sank, and got sunk. We encountered toxic players, and angels. We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune. Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water tower, we performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while “searching” the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after (he was a great sport about it all.) He came back once and after a great fight, we sank him. At the end of the night, after depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sands, we noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event. We scuttled our ship and hid. They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game (one of their “big bwudas” introduced him. Awe!) We emoted, the kid gave an amazing toast in the tavern, and we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair. I can’t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is. Be a good person, treat others with kindness, and remember, on the other side of the pirate is a person. Cheers!

582660,Black Desert,"You need to understand three things about this game.
1.) The game is gorgeous, but, it's a glorified interactive casino. Everything in this game is RNG dependant. 
2.) Like all forms of gambling, this game is extremely addicting. At first it may not be apparent, but, if you're running a beefy PC your electric bill will inform you that this game is consuming your life. 
3.) Like all forms of gambling, this game has the potential to be extremely expensive or extremely cheap while providing the same level of ""fun.""  The ""Pay to Win"" aspect of this game solely exists in the form of convenience. It is 100% impossible for you to spend $100,000 an expect to be the best geared player in the game. That said, it is 100% POSSIBLE for you to spend $100,000 and feel like you still need to spend more. 

So let's talk about that Cost for a second...

The game is designed to make it seem as though you need to spend, roughly $150 in order to have enough pets (for auto-looting), carry weight, and inventory space. However, if you're not a ""hard core"" player the 4 pets you get from questing and the additional 1 pet (5 total) you eventually get from your log-in bonus are more than adequate to keep up with most people's grind habits. The additional inventory slots you get from questing are also more than adequate for most people. Additionally, as a new player you receive several free Value Packs.

The Value Pack acts as a $15/month subscription service. However, if you focus your first month of the game on learning and gearing up you will easily find yourself having an income high enough to purchase a new value pack every month with in-game currency. In the event that you are a little slower on the uptake, you could join any guild that offers 5m silver / day daily pay and push all of that money into a city storage you don't often visit. Then, at the end of the month, you will find that your guild has effectively paid for your value pack. 

TLDR: If you are not a Hard Core player then the purchase price of the game is the only money you will ever *need* to spend. 

But what if you are a hard core player? Well, then, your entry fee is closer to the ball park of $150~250 depending on your Luck with obtaining Tier 4 pets, which is a gambling process involving purchasing multiple of the same type of pet and combining them for a chance at increasing their Tier. You're also going to want as many character slots as you can so that you 1) camp every boss site, 2) have a daily/weekly life skill character at each major resource hotspot, and 3) increase your family fame fund (daily silver awarded to you at log-in). As a Hard Core player you're also going to keep your Silver focused on obtaining stronger / better gear so you'll have a recurring payment of $15/mo ($45/90-day) Value Pack *and* an additional $25/mo for Blessing of Kamasylve (increases drop rate). The Kamasylve cost is mitigated by events where they give 7~15 day kamas out like candy so you can think of this in annual terms at about $150/year. As a Hard Core player you also will want to, later on, protect your TET and PEN enhancements using Cron stones. If you're lucky enough to be in a siege or node warring guild you might already have enough SILVER to buy Cron stones. However, only about 20% of players fall into this category. For everyone else there's Master Card. Reach into that wallet and spend roughly $68 on Costumes to extract Cron stones from *PER ATTEMPT.* Remember what we said about gambling? You can absolutely spend a million dollars here and never get any further. 

But Z!! This sounds an awful lot like Pay to Win!! 
True, depending on your definition of Pay to Win. But consider the following: if you're not a hard core player then you probably aren't ever going to bother with high level enhancing. This means if you decide to get stronger you're probably going to spend in-game currency. Mister Mastercard might spend  $10,000 on his first PEN item. You're going to spend about 17 billion silver on your first PEN. Most casual players at end game can rack in 400~800m/week which means you will see that PEN in about 28 weeks. Most Pay 2 Win type of people are not wealthy enough to drop $360/week into a video game. Do they exist? Sure, but, you have the same chance of meeting Clint Eastwood in Japan as you do of meeting one of those players. At this stage in the game, who is to say the person you run into isn't just someone who has played since launch?  Point is, it's not going to affect your experience on way or the other. 

So now let's get REALLY dramatic. Let's say money is no object for you and you want to be the best, of the best, of the best. Grinding is for peasants, you want to make all of your money and obtain all your gear without even leaving Velia. Bad news, bud. This isn't the game for you. The number of Pearl items you can sell is directly affected by the number of characters you have at level cap. If you only get 1 character to level 60 before you decide you're going to be a wallet warrior, you're only able to sell 10 Pearl Items / week. That means you are hard-capped at 3.35 billion silver / week on money. Your first PEN item is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to pay with cash BUT WAIT! There's more! As of writing this post there have only ever been 121 PEN Kzarka Blades sold on the central market place. Meaning, even if you have the silver you are still relying on the rest of the community to make the item.

Okay, so what? You'll just Master Card your way through the TET and PEN attempts. Well, we know of at least 1 player on the NA server who has, so far, failed 85 times in a row on safe TET attempts. But let's say you don't have the worst luck, let's say you have fairly average luck. You are going to attempt about 8 times for TET and about 20 times for PEN. If all of these are going to be safe attempts that's $1,360 for your PEN after you spend $240 on your TET. For simplicity sake let's call it $1,500 per PEN.. this will see you at $10,500 for PEN Armor and Weapons. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!

Accessories will always downgrade on fail when using crons, or break without crons. Let's be generous and say you have average luck, you're using crons, it's all pay 2 win, and we'll call it a conservative $2,000 per PEN accessory. That's an added $6,000

In short, the cost of outright pay 2 win in this game is a paltry $16,000 for the gear BUT DON'T STOP THERE!  Did you think having full PEN would make you formidable in the game? HA! You still need your Dream Horse.  Let's be generous with that too and tack on another $2,000. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! You need a Frigate! And your Frigate has to be the best of the best of the best.  Let's call it $1,000 per piece of gear to hit +10 (frigate equivelant of PEN) and ignore the cost of actually buying blue gear. So there's another $4,000. So now we're at $21,000 to pay to win the game.

BUT WAIT!! Did you think having a fully decked out frigate was going to make you the strongest master of the sea? WRONG!! Because the free to play pleb has a Carrack. You need to get yourself a Galleus or a Carrack to keep up the pace. Can't let yourself be sunk by some guy that maybe spent $100 on the game. You're a Wallet Warrior, you fall to nobody! So you swipe your card.....  only to find that every single item required to make that ship can only be obtained through Bartering. A long process that requires your physical labor. 

 Where does a full PEN level 60 Wallet Warrior fit in? Bad news, guy. You have to grind. Because unless you are level 62+ you aren't scary even with full PEN. The cost to make you a God amongst players your same level without lifting a finger? $10~20,000 USD. The cost to make you useful in a siege or node war? Priceless.

294100,RimWorld,"Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:

- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her ""Butters"", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.
- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.
- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.

(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)

- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.
- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.

But then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:

- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.
- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.
- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.
- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.
- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.
- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.
- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!

(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)

- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.
- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.
- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)
- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. 
- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. 
- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.
- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. 
- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.
- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. 
- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.
- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.

After the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: ""What kind of f***ed up game is that?""

[Edit review 21.04.2022] 
As you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!

1063730,New World,"For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future

Pros:
- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing
- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones
- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start
- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few
- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow
- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights
- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun

Cons:
- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?
- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion
- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity
- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times
- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare
- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game
- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already
- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap
- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive

If this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a story-driven experience that explores the gradual descent into psychosis of the protagonist – Senua. Its representation of mental illness can be eye-opening and disturbing at times, and the use of real-time motion capture and binaural audio design are impressive.

The puzzle-solving and pacing of the game can feel a little tedious at times, but these are inconsequential when considering the overall message or intention of the game.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I originally pre-ordered this game back in 2014. I found it to some-what fun but other titles at the time were far more interesting to me and ended up side-tracking me from playing ESO.
I had stopped playing the game all together, and did not return.

I recently read that the game had been revamped for 2020 offering many more features, and changes.
I have now played a character from the start in 2020 and leveled that character to max level, here is my honest review:

PROS: 
-Great scenery, graphics are great, character models look awesome.
-Excellent exploration, seriously, you will find yourself just running around looking at interesting things from time to time.
-Fun combat, controls flow nicely. Also cool to see an MMO that can be played on controller.
-Character building is very unique in this and allows the creator of the character to really build a very unique feeling class. This allows for quite a diversity in game-play.
-PVP Game mode is very fun. Definitely has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, the PVP is very unique and offers a lot of replay-ability.
-In game purchases are available but none of them are a pay to win option. (The in-game purchases are mostly stuff like costumes or cosmetic changes.)
-There are some nostalgic elements in this game that remind me of previous single player Elder Scrolls titles.

CONS:
-The questing is interesting, but can become repetitive and chore-like. (As is per normal of an MMO)
-Alot of the quests share some overly similar story-lines. However, I do also understand this is an MMO with tons of quests in it.
-The dungeons do get better towards the higher character levels, but at first they offer zero challenge and are fairly boring. I found myself just kind of running around, using random abilities with no serious sense of direction.
-First person game-play is neat to offer, but is never used. There is seriously no point in using it.
-There can be a few moments when playing where you can get stuck on terrain or find it hard to jump up on top of something, which can be minorly annoying. 
-Group queuing for PVP is currently removed, which in my opinion takes away from the PVP experience.

Overall I would recommend this game if you're a fan of MMOs and of course a fan of the Elder Scrolls games.
This game does have an Elder Scrolls feel to it, the environment and game-play does feel like Tamriel.
If you're going to compare this game to World of Warcraft, you won't like it. It has a very different play style, however I do believe that ESO has a refreshing feel to it.

The developers appear to still care about the game as well, being that content is regularly added to keep the game interesting.

TLDR: Game is good, give it a go.

I had already been bitten by that point, trying to make the most of my time left, stashing things away for my next survivor to find. I put my weapons outside that house and stripped down for an easy target later while I locked myself in the closet room waiting to turn.

A small swarm started knocking on The windows of that house, as I stood in the closet waiting to peacefully die. The constant knocks reminded me of why I was here.. why I was hiding with no clothes on and that soon, I would be torn to pieces.

I wanted to have atleast some control of how I would die in this bleak and dreadful world. but alas; this was not going to happen if the Zombies came in now.

1599340,Lost Ark,"This is a love letter to Lost Ark, a game that crept up out of nowhere and took control of my life in 2022. This game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to me now, but there was a time where it was sweet and lovely. I wish my feelings for the game had remained strong, but that's not the world we live in, not the world I live in.

The bots are demolishing the economy, the content is unnecessarily grindy, Amazon cares little about communicating with their playerbase, and Smilegate has put every region except Korea on the back-burner. I want to keep playing this game. I want to go back to the days where I was the guild master trying my absolute hardest to support my many guild mates, who I had been together with since Tier 1, when times were simpler. I want the feeling of burnout to stop, but I am sure it never will, even if its been half a year since I played the game religiously.

Amazon will never admit that bots will never be removed and that the problem will only get worse. They'll never acknowledge that the alt grind is too much for the average player. They won't explain the reasons why they run things the way they do. This isn't the game that I signed up for. 

What do I mean by this game not being the game that I signed up for? In Korea, Lost Ark leveled the MMO scene and demolished the competition. There was a mass exodus of players from every major MMO to Lost Ark. Players were tired of games where the developers didn't communicate with its players, had horrendous grindfests, and had severe content droughts. Lost Ark turned into the very thing that MMO lovers had wanted to run away from, and it seems like there's no hope in the future as well. How did this happen? I just want to know personally because it hurts not knowing what went wrong. Legendary director Gold River leaving may have played a part in it. Or the unsolvable bot problem. Maybe Amazon deserves all of the blame? I don't know. All I know is that this is not the game that I downloaded on February 11, 2022, and I don't think it ever will be. I want to call for some sort of action, some changes, but I already gave up on that a long time ago, nothing is going to change and I accept that.

I accept that the game has problems that will never be resolved. It hurts, but I accept it. I love Lost Ark because of what it meant to me. Ultimately, I will love it no matter what path it goes down. I left the game not with a bang, but a whimper, and that's just how it's going to be.",love letter lost ark game crept nowhere took control life 2022 game leaf bitter taste mouth time sweet lovely wish feeling game remained strong world live world live bot demolishing economy content unnecessarily grindy amazon care little communicating playerbase smilegate put every region except korea back burner want keep playing game want go back day guild master trying absolute hardest support many guild mate together since tier 1 time simpler want feeling burnout stop sure never even half year since played game religiously amazon never admit bot never removed problem get worse never acknowledge alt grind much average player explain reason run thing way game signed mean game game signed korea lost ark leveled mmo scene demolished competition mass exodus player every major mmo lost ark player tired game developer communicate player horrendous grindfests severe content drought lost ark turned thing mmo lover wanted run away seems like hope future well happen want know personally hurt knowing went wrong legendary director gold river leaving may played part unsolvable bot problem maybe amazon deserves blame know know game downloaded february 11 2022 think ever want call sort action change already gave long time ago nothing going change accept accept game problem never resolved hurt accept love lost ark meant ultimately love matter path go left game bang whimper going

It's a great mix between a survival game and a monster collector game. While it obviously has same elements as most other P named monster collector games, I would say Palworld has it's own identity and gameplay and it's own legs to stand on.

I definitely thought it's a meme game before I got to test it during network test access and I was completely blown away with how it beat all my expectations to the point it's instant buy for me.

There is some lore, but it's mostly hidden and scattered throughout the game in text form. Don't expect much story from it or some quests, treat this as a survival game.

UI is a bit lacking, but you get used to it.

703080,Planet Zoo,"I really don't want to give this game a thumbs down! It's more like a neutral (+) review. If you like planet coaster or zoos, you will probably like this game too! A dream for patient builders, but with many technical issues. It's very fun but feels like a beta. It has a lot of bugs, performance issues and a fast game speed. So, should you buy it?

Finally! I've waited too long for this game! Zoo Tycoon was one of my first PC games. It's very nostalgic for me. I've played it  for hours! It's awesome to see a proper modern zoo game. Though I'm still a bit disappointed.

Pros:
1. Good graphics, realistic animal animations, great rain and snow effects.
2. Very relaxing and immersive zoo experience. You really feel like you're in a zoo.
3. More than 50 detailed, lovely, cute and different animals. Very fun to watch!
4. Lovely details, 7 different biomes, climate does matter, a lot place to build.
5. A dream for builders. Creative and free ways to build, blueprints, workshop,...
6. 4 different game modes; career, sandbox, franchise and challenge mode.
7. A very, very good sound. The music and animal sounds are incredible.
8. You can learn more about the animals if you want to. (real life and ingame)

Neutral:
1. The management is better than in Planet coaster, but still not that great/important.
2. You can visit other zoos but it would be much better if there would be more features.
3. The career is ok,  but nothing special. It's like a tutorial but it's not a good one.

Cons:
1. Horrible performance! It's not as worse as in planet coaster but still disappointing.
2. Many, many bugs! I luckily didn't have any long term game breaking bugs yet! Please fix!
3. The game is too fast! 3 seconds are 1 day. Make it customizable!
4. The controls are bad/complex.
5. No petting zoo, underwater animals, birds, etc. A bunch of popular animals are missing.
6. I'm like 100% sure that there will be many, many expensive DLC's.
7. No mod support.

Conclusion:
Well, I already said what I like and what I don't like. It's a very fun, relaxing and realistic game. You really feel immersed, but sadly the game feels like a beta. It has a lot of bugs and a poor performance. I'm pretty sure that I will play this game for a very long time. It's a dream for patient people who love to decorate and build! They should have delayed the release, but I hope that they will fix the performance and bugs in future!

Should you buy it? Well, if you are a zoo or planet coaster fan and like building and decorating you should consider buying it. But you should keep in mind that it still has a lot of bugs (game breaking too), a bad performance and a few other negative points. If you don't care about them buy it. If you should, you should wait for a few patches or/and a sale or just skip the game.

I will try to update this review after an upcoming (big) DLC/Patch!

Still questions? Feel free to write a comment or send me a message.

1551360,Forza Horizon 5,"[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]


I've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.
With that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.

[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]


The game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.
[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.

The game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.

[b]Other content in this game[/b]

* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.
* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.
* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.
* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).
* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.
* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.
* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.
* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.
* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.


[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]



[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]

This game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.
Now, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.
Imo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).


[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:

1080p high - 113 FPS
1080p ultra - 79 FPS
1440p high - 99 FPS
1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)

Upscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.


[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",h1 600 hour played month extra via gamepass im ready drop goodbye review h1 bought game knowing im getting playing fh4 roughly 500 hour discord community engaging game player overall high quality made want keep playing forzas way time initially intended im really grateful discord group staff member reason said playing make experience way quicker burnt community aint talking co op convoy getting content player befriend talk online community wise game feel kinda like gta v online dropped unnamed massive server random player around yet arent given enough tool properly communicate add horrendous platform called m store xbox console companion feel damn clunky even befriending chatting friend gauntlet make feel like really need find actual community 3rd party platform discord generally ideal else left play alone even game online mode hurdle felt regardless playing steam version m version making m account necessary game work connected online b ok enough chatter friend b game great welcoming car newbs car nut alike matter car spectrum irl gaming world feel fun game especially first 2nd forza horizon experience e havent played fh 1 3 fh4 quite similar one lot passion put fh5 given lot qol update predecessor thing like increased amount prop ability put prop route creation design track prop involved turning game gmod like experience inclined alongside adding rule driving experience turning typical race minigame different objective finish first b important side note b game mostly arcade fun designed sim racing mind meaning gripe physic sound lack competitiveness etc quite redundant always fragile balance fun realism also game fulfill mid 2000 nfs vibe game sub genre sort le weeb car upgrade tho plentiful overall nitro car veriety making new build game structured playlist system month divided 4 season 4 season per month one per week month called series game devs pushing game month long content enjoy weekly reset time season happening every thursday afternoon month theme e g japanese car offroad racing classic car high performance track car etc week season get new playlist objective generally referred weekly grind like certain tournament stuff playing pause would take 5 10 hour finish entire weekly playlist typical non tryhardy playstyle b content game b 700 car total added every month new free update spacious open world map mexico drive freely player randoms friend either freeroam grouped convoy co op mode random lobby friend invite ahead time online racing playing upto 11 player bot typical fashion racing xp money game currency called cr short community made track real fun begin especially member group delivers high quality custom track track theme like high low performance car road type etc auction house buy sell car auction player forza official radio station genre like edm pop music hip hop rock lot latina based music community livery tune create share car tune livery take others community database countless minigames like capture flag zombie super7 custom objective based challenge even full scale battle royale mode b gamertag avees128 check custom track tune feel like b b game version dlc expansion buy b game 3 version standard deluxe premium general thinking buy either standard premium version deluxe give base game car pas free access bunch car could eventually get game anyway without paying game version premium version game also add meaningless car pack importantly 2 expansion map could see fairly negative review 2 expansion hot wheel rally adventure steam reviewer compared dlc dlc past fh game objectively superior current one way care hot wheel skip rally fanatic skip one well imo 2 dlc dont give enjoyable content im even fan hw rally especially compared past dlc fh4 personally played loved every inch fh3 played hear positive thing dlc ironically one hw b performance b ryzen 9 5900x amd rx 5700xt testing built benchmark year ago getting following result 1080p high 113 fps 1080p ultra 79 fps 1440p high 99 fps 1440p ultra 69 fps nice upscaling fsr dl game really bad amd nvidia tech avoid cant comment ray tracing since cant run rt feature gpu tell minimal rt best also mean minimal performance drop game really love smart access memory rebar make sure enabled great fps boost 20 b conclusion b game great legit time sink better worse engaged welcoming community relatively short amount time 50 100ish hour till feel exhausted endless grind everything bare mind unsure game fit flavor racing game would either opt standard version try via gamepass see feel like note cross save m store platform steam need start switching version

899770,Last Epoch,"There have been recent review bombs because of multiplayer ""launch"" issues. Basically, the developers spent a long time working on making their single-player game multiplayer, and launch got hammered by 3-4x their expected player numbers, so the servers had massive issues. I personally don't think people should review games based on server issues that are in the process of being fixed in a game that's still in beta, but I digress. 

At the time of writing this I have 30 some odd hours on steam, but maybe 100-200 with their standalone launcher throughout the past few years. I've watched this game grow from the most barebones, amateur looking RPG, to a super polished, promising soon-to-be competitor to the loot-based ARPG behemoths (PoE, d4). 

Last Epoch is an uncut gem. I've watched the passionate developers work based on community feedback and vision for years now. I cannot wait to see where this game is in a year or two at this trajectory, because the 0.9 multiplayer launch has already far exceeded my expectations. I don't think it's in a position to compete with PoE and D4 at the moment, but as it grows and gets better and better it definitely will. This is a developer team to watch closely, and It would be dumb for GGG and Blizzard to not take a look at how they've taken outdated systems from other ARPGs and made them a lot better. 

This game as is pre-launch is already a 7/10. As they flesh out end game, add their 3 launch classes, and stick to their philosophy on game design and working with the community to make a good game, I can easily foresee it being a 9/10, and I expect that it will end up sharing the top few spots in viewer numbers with PoE in the ARPG genre.",recent review bomb multiplayer launch issue basically developer spent long time working making single player game multiplayer launch got hammered 3 4x expected player number server massive issue personally think people review game based server issue process fixed game still beta digress time writing 30 odd hour steam maybe 100 200 standalone launcher throughout past year watched game grow barebones amateur looking rpg super polished promising soon competitor loot based arpg behemoth poe d4 last epoch uncut gem watched passionate developer work based community feedback vision year wait see game year two trajectory 0 9 multiplayer launch already far exceeded expectation think position compete poe d4 moment grows get better better definitely developer team watch closely would dumb ggg blizzard take look taken outdated system arpgs made lot better game pre launch already 7 10 flesh end game add 3 launch class stick philosophy game design working community make good game easily foresee 9 10 expect end sharing top spot viewer number poe arpg genre
2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","As of writing this review, I am technically 50h since I played the technical beta for an extended period of time. However, despite the lengthy sessions of fun i had with the game I can´t recommend it in its current state. 

I am hardlocked in chapter 2 with 3 different bugs preventing me from progressing the game. There is nothing left for me to do since all 3 mainquests goals are affected. One does not progress despite killing the npc the game told me to kill, one does not spawn the necessary npc for me to talk to progress the story and one is locked behind space combat, which is near impossible for me to beat due to the ship post UI bugging out preventing me from accessing this feature. I am unable to use ship skills, which makes ship combat tedious, unfun and very hard. 

Now the game has lots of other softlocks and hardlocks affecting not only me but also other players, which leads me to believe there is a serious problem with how flags for quests work or in this case do not work. 

But wait, that’s not all. Animations are straight up missing for some abilities, like the molten beam ability for psykers, some items are missing effects and stats, menu and UI elements keep bugging out so you have to reload the game and lose progress to be able to access those features again. I am sure they will fix those issues in time with patches but currently I am unable to draw a positive conclusion about the game. 

Rogue trader is a great game with lots of lore, quests, secretes and features to explore. But in its current state I can´t recommend it.

I am just sad now. Please fix this game so we can enjoy it in its fullest.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"[h1]Monster Hunter: World is an action role-playing game In an unnamed low fantasy setting, humans and other sentient races have set their eyes on the New World, a separate continent from the populated Old World. The New World is an untamed wilderness where many powerful monsters roam free, and where researchers have been drawn to uncover new mysteries. The player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces.  [/h1]

[b]Enjoyable Hunting, Grinding, and the Community is Great. 

Gameplay - Great because it has many weapons and weapon movesets you can learn, several monsters to hunt, monster movesets to learn, tons of side contents, expeditions, multiplayer if u want to play with your friends but solo is preferable too if u want a challenge, and more. 

Difficulty - Challenging especially Iceborne (DLC) and the True Final Boss or Final Title Update will gonna beat the hell out of you until you lose your sanity but it's a relief and very satisfying if u defeated it.

Graphics - You'll forget what reality is.

Length - This game is long in Story but the length of what u can do in this game is 
""To infinity and beyond""

Sound Effects, Music, and Voices - Eargasm except for ""The Handler"" because I want to punch my monitor every I hear her voice. (no pun intended)

Plot - Average but here's the example: A particular focus of the Expedition is to study Elder Dragons, powerful beasts that can affect entire ecosystems, and why they migrate to the New World every ten years in an event known as the Elder Crossing.

MHW is one of the best games I've ever played and is now My Favorite Game of All Time.

This is the first time I created a long-ass review because I love this game and of course MH Series as well.

MY RATING: 
Plot - 6/10           
Gameplay - 10/10                       
Enjoyment - 10/10
Overall - 10/10 for me [/b]

I bought Valheim for both myself and my wife off the recommendation from a co-worker. One I wouldn't typically take gaming advice from. Normally I'd watch it played on Twitch or watch SOME kind of gameplay video. I NEVER buy a game blind. I don't know what possessed me to do that with Valheim but I did. 

We loaded up character select and I went to create a character and I saw the visuals of my avatar. I looked at my wife and said, ""lets start that 2 hour timer cause Steam won't refund if you've played longer than 2 hours"".

Our first session was 12 hours and we played most of the next day as well. We're pushing 450-500 hours played. Bought it for both our kids and have a world that we play with them separate from our main one. I lose entire days to building projects.

Before I proceed to rip this game apart, I just want to highlight the fact that at its' core it is an amazing game with boundless potential considering that it is still in early access.

In it's current state I feel like there are some major missed opportunities, some basic features I would have expected for the genre and some quality of life improvements that I would love to see;

[b]Lack of bio-diversity[/b] 
The amount of variety of Mushrooms is on point, the way it has been implemented is immersive and I love it. But compared to berries I just get confused. Maybe the dev team just really like mushrooms or perhaps they are allergic to berries, I don't know. But I would have loved to see blackberries, forest/wild strawberries, raspberries, lingonberries and gooseberries.
I can accept the fact that there seems to be a lack of wildlife diversity considering the small region the game is played out in, but I would have liked to have seen more critters such as squirrels, mice and birds.

[b]Lack of wages[/b]
You are literally convincing immigrants to enter into indentured servitude for nothing but food and shelter until the day they die of old age while you reap all of the rewards. *cough* voluntary slavery *cough*

[b]Make Houses Great Again[/b] 
This is a big annoyance to me personally, walking through my town I keep seeing the same house again and again and again and again and again. I would have loved to see that each wall type would have 10-12 variations, a bit of Ivy on one, a cross beam on another, a bit of moss here and an oddly colored stone in another. It seems like something that wouldn't be overly difficult to implement in all honesty and a massive missed opportunity to create an engaging and immersive experience.

[b]Small structures[/b]
Why can I not dig a well? It seems like a fairly common object to find in a medieval village.
Why can I not build a watchtower? Hopefully this'll come with bandits.. It seems like another missed opportunity considering villagers will actually patrol at night, let them go to a watchtower instead. Maybe the building is purely aesthetic, maybe it increases happiness to villagers that live withing 50m, doesn't matter, it would have been immersive and given the players more range to create amazing things.
Why can I not build a gate? What's the point of walls when you have to leave openings all over the place?

[b]Villager Professions[/b]
Let me hire a villager to be a groundskeeper, someone who'll simply walk around and make sure that all buildings in a range around his ""shed"" is fixed up at all times.
Let me hire a villager to be a scribe, let it cost me 5000 to send that villager off for a year to learn the trade. Once back, that villager should improve the level of information available in the management tab including details such as wood, food and tool usage per day/season/year vs (expected) production per day/season/year to allow me to make better decisions regarding what to build, where to assign villagers etc.
The scribe should also allow the player to send them on trade missions to far off places, making agreements on the export of goods. I cannot stress how much this would improve the late game where often I have to throw away stuff at the end of every season because all the vendors are broke and I am out of storage.

[b]Introduce Religion[/b]
In a northern European, medieval setting, not seeing a single church, abbey or monastery strikes me as odd. Perhaps the setting isn't medieval at all but more late bronze/early iron age, but then there surely would be some pagan shrines or buildings of worship no? 
Add it, please. I would love to be able to build a church as part of a challenge from the King once my town reaches a certain size, committing me to pay wages to a member of the clergy, maintaining the church and providing it with the required materials to operate. All in exchange for a large boost to the mood of the villagers.

[b]Small quality of life changes that I absolutely need[/b]
Allow walls (and buildings) to snap to grid and each other.
Allow villagers to be assigned to move soil to level bumpy areas. 
While placing buildings allow hotkeys to lock them in certain directions such as facing north while the player freely moves around. 
Detach foundations of buildings from the buildings themselves and treat the foundations as fields when being placed.
Add clutter to building interiors!
Allow players to dig up ""Sticks"" (the small saplings of the 3 types of trees) and re-plant them (without fields/orchards!).

2157560,Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising,"i grew up with Street Fighter 2 and Alpha, Fatal Fury, Mortal Kombat, and Virtua Fighter. The last fighting game I played a lot was Marvel Vs Capcom 2. I thought my days enjoying fighters were over when i developed carpal tunnel in my left wrist, but this game has allowed me to enjoy fighting games again. I don't know much about the Granblue characters or lore, but I do know that I haven't had this much fun playing a fighting game in a very long time. The simplified inputs have allowed me to enjoy the strategy, mindgames, and competition again. The arcade mode, story mode, and party game mode ""Grand Bruise"" are all fun additions to the core online versus mode. I'm also very impressed at how smoothly it plays online even with 100+ millisecond ping differences between opponents. In about 200 matches I've only encountered one or two noticeable instances of lag. As a programmer myself that's quite a technical accomplishment. The developers should be very proud of what they've achieved here.

If you're a beginner who's interested in learning how to play fighting games without the steep dexterity requirements of other titles, or a veteran who had to shelve fighting games for RSI reasons, this is an ideal choice and I don't think you'll be disappointed. For the grand total of zero dollars it's certainly worth your time to give it a try and see if you like it as much as I do.",grew street fighter 2 alpha fatal fury mortal kombat virtua fighter last fighting game played lot marvel v capcom 2 thought day enjoying fighter developed carpal tunnel left wrist game allowed enjoy fighting game know much granblue character lore know much fun playing fighting game long time simplified input allowed enjoy strategy mindgames competition arcade mode story mode party game mode grand bruise fun addition core online versus mode also impressed smoothly play online even 100 millisecond ping difference opponent 200 match encountered one two noticeable instance lag programmer quite technical accomplishment developer proud achieved beginner interested learning play fighting game without steep dexterity requirement title veteran shelve fighting game rsi reason ideal choice think disappointed grand total zero dollar certainly worth time give try see like much

1190970,House Flipper 2,"In 10 hours I've beaten all the story missions.
There is no option for invert.
There are no before/after photos.
There are no buyer preferences.
There are no accessibility options.

I have like 350+ hours in the first game, and I had really high hopes for this one. But I'll be honest. This doesn't feel like a sequel, it feels like a cheap knockoff of HF1, made by someone that doesn't understand what anyone liked about the first game.

It's clunky, the new mechanics are tiresome, there's almost nothing in the store. THERE'S NO OPTION FOR INVERT so I have to do everything really really slowly.

Without before/after photos I can't see what I even did, which was half the fun and satisfaction.

All we wanted was the same thing, with better graphics, a few QOL updates, and more items. HF2 changes almost every mechanic in the game to be something new and worse, the graphics look TERRIBLE compared to the first game, and, like I said, I did all the missions within 10 hours. I flipped a single house after the missions, and since I had no buyer input to go on, I just painted aimlessly, which kind of hurt my hands as you have to hold down a button to paint every pixel of a wall.

Most of these issues should have come out in Beta, and we shouldn't need 15 DLCs to get the features we liked in the first game.

I honestly might uninstall and just wait for updates.",10 hour beaten story mission option invert photo buyer preference accessibility option like 350 hour first game really high hope one honest feel like sequel feel like cheap knockoff hf1 made someone understand anyone liked first game clunky new mechanic tiresome almost nothing store option invert everything really really slowly without photo see even half fun satisfaction wanted thing better graphic qol update item hf2 change almost every mechanic game something new worse graphic look terrible compared first game like said mission within 10 hour flipped single house mission since buyer input go painted aimlessly kind hurt hand hold button paint every pixel wall issue come beta need 15 dlcs get feature liked first game honestly might uninstall wait update

1240440,Halo Infinite,"If you want a review from a hardcore Halo fan, here it is. I grew up on Halo, I lived and breathed Halo my entire youth, and I can say with absolute confidence this game feels like Halo. The campaign for this game is a massive step in the right direction for 343 compared to the previous 2 titles. I enjoyed my play through on Heroic from front to back. I don't want to spoil any of the story, but I will say that it lacks in a couple of departments. However, the good outweighs the bad overall and I would definitely play it again when co-op is added. If you can get the story mode on sale for around $30-40, I found it to be worth around that price. However...I have to talk about the other half of this game.

The multiplayer mode of this game had so much potential. When it first came out, I absolutely could not get enough. The maps, the new guns, everything felt so right and I felt a happiness I hadn't for a long time. I wasn't even that mad about the 10 dollar price for the battlepass, as I felt that for the most part, the content you got was worth it (Especially if you have fond memories of Halo: Reach). 343 was extremely vocal about all the content / bug fixes / updates they had planned. I was so overly excited for all of these things, and I felt that for once I could actually believe in 343 Industries. However, as time went on, and I became more distant from the honeymoon phase of the game, I began to feel the burnout. 343 had not been up to schedule on everything they said they were, and the excuses kept coming. Something was wrong, but there was still enough hope in the community for them to pull through. I finished the battlepass, and eventually stopped playing. Since then, season 2 has released. However, the community has been extremely vocal about the slew of issues presented with this new season. Unfortunately, it seems that 343 has all but lied throughout the launch and post-launch of this game. I want to like this game, I really do, but its getting to the point where its becoming impossible. Somehow, if a couple years from now they have fixed the multiplayer, and people are having fun, I will return. But until then, I wouldn't waste my time.

WotC has made it clear they want to milk you as much as they can and if you don’t comply you’ll be stuck trying to slowly piece together a good deck.

Crashes happen a lot and I’ve lost games because of said crashes putting me behind my opponent.

1248130,Farming Simulator 22,"Updated 10/13/23

(Summary at bottom)
NOT a reskinned FS19. I have about 650 hours on FS19 and I can most certainly say this is much better in many ways, and many things have been completely overhauled. 

- Sounds have had a major overhaul, makes the game feel more realistic and immersive.
- A few minor realism additions, like visual gear-shifting, cab suspension, etc.
- More placeables than ever, including sheds with working doors, refuel stations, seed & fert tanks, etc. Fences, lights, and other decor too, to brighten up your farm a bit.
- Many new brands, and more tire brand options. Also license plates for equipment and vehicles.
- Character customization. Imo, not the best, graphics and general proportions look weird, but hey, better than before.
- Better organized XML files. Much more easier on the eyes compared to FS17, and easier to find things such as the money value. I don't need to use ctrl+f anymore, I can just scroll. (Speaking of XML editing, instead of editing the careerSavegame.xml file like FS17 & FS19 to edit your cash, here you need to edit farms.xml file instead in the same folder, careerSavegame.xml is only for appearance in the main menu.)
- Better organized shop UI, not to mention the UI overall. Imo, the weird blue fade on the speedometer/tachometer reminds me of those old games, and I wish they had just instead updated the FS19 one.
- An actual American-based map. Major improvement from Ravenport and Goldcrest Valley, feels more of the true american countryside thanks to that new office here in the U.S. that Giants got a while ago.
- Buying used equipment. Great for starting a farm on a tight budget, and in multiplayer you can buy other farm's sold vehicles. Wish there was more than 5 at a time though.
- Vehicle gearbox. Not required if you don't want to use it, but I like it. A wee bit confusing at times however, I'm used to the way you shift in American Truck Simulator, but this is different. Not bad, maybe needs to be tweaked a bit. Will note that it's sometimes buggy, especially with mods.
- Obviously graphics, you won't really notice a huge jump between FS19 and FS22 as the major jump of the franchise was between FS17 and FS19, but there are some noticeable changes. Also, 3D tracks on tractors. No more jpeg tracks.
- Seasons. I don't like playing so realistic to the point I have to wait time for the proper planting and harvesting time, but there's an option to make it so the seasons are just visual only. 
- Multiplayer Voice Chat, very useful.

Now, there are of course many bugs with the game, and some features missing since it got released not too long ago. 

Some rather aggravating bugs/missing features are:
- Landscaping, a tad bit annoying with the camera and movement. There's no snapping things to a certain rotation, and the camera angle is from a bird's eye view that swoops down instead of zooming in, which is rather annoying when trying to line things up together. There's also no sprinting like in FS17 (idk about the others)
- AI workers. We all know from previous FS games that the AI is notorious, especially in FS17. Here, there have been some improvements, and with the addition of AI being able to drive vehicles to and fro, that's really useful, but again, very buggy. The classic 'Helper F is blocked by an object!' pops up every now and then, you tab over and there's nothing in it's way. Lately, on modded maps, the AI sometimes will just sit there doing nothing. Possibly just a mod-side issue. 
- Buildings, most notably the farmhouse. If you look into the windows, it's just a copied .jpeg of a weird looking kitchen with yellow cabinets and a granite looking wall. I'm sure Giants will add in an interior at some point, I don't want jpeg interiors like FS13 & FS17. Also, you cannot interact with/enter any existing buildings/sheds/barns on the farms on the land you purchase. I sure hope that gets changed.(note: kinda sorta fixed? some sheds you can enter)

Bugs TL;DR:
- Landscaping (Controls & viewing angles are awkward)
- AI Driving/Transport (Blocked by nothing, drives the wrong path or drives in circles')
- didn't note this but general physics, collisions, and the gearbox still need to be tuned.

TL;DR:

There are many bugs, I hope they'll be fixed before the next year. But there are also many improvements from previous FS games, as someone who's played FS13 (Xbox 360), 17 (Steam), and 19 (Epic Games).

At this time, with the amount of bugs/missing features in the game, you can go ahead and buy it if you want. I managed to snag a deal with the season passes where I got both for like $30, damn good deal, would NOT recommend paying full price for each individual DLC.

I have not tested everything, and I have not played every map. I do not have all of the bugs and missing features listed, I will update this review as I come across more notable bugs, missing features, and changes from previous FS games.

Again, this is a newly released game, so unless Giants decides to not fix these issues/keep them removed like EA did with Battlefield 2042, then I will change this review as needed.

11/24/21 Update

So you can use Q & E to switch between the license plate types, yet when you're typing in your custom license plate and you need to press Q or E, it switches the license plate type. They do have an on-screen keyboard I assume for consoles, but I really don't want to *click, move mouse (repeat 8 more times)* every single time I have to put in a license plate. My way to bypass this is make sure the color selection is highlighted when you start typing.

The field care addon is nice, more stuff to do with Grain farming. I haven't really played around with that yet.

Graphics for working the fields look much better, but when the field state changes (harvested to cultivated, to plowed, etc) is still very noticeable and jittery, a bit annoying as it is ruining the immersion a little.

Pallet physics have improved a ton, however, but they do still slide around imo a wee bit too easily.

Bigbags! Can easily pick them up with anything with forks, and you can feel that you're picking up a heavy item. They have realistic physics, so that's nice.

12/31/21 Update

- Pre-Placed Buildings can now be deleted off of farms.
- The issue with the semi truck axles acting weird is now fixed. They drive much smoother now.

Graphics:

✅Beautiful.
☐ Masterpiece.

Especially fur quality and light dynamics stand out.

Price:
✅Full Price.
☐ Wait For Sale.
☐ Refund It If You Can.
☐ Don't Buy It.
☐ Free.

In my opinion, 45 euro's is a lot of money for a game. However, because of the amount of content and completeness of this game, I believe this is worth it. Especially considering the fact that other publishers,[b] *cough [/b] [spoiler] EA [/spoiler], would charge 60 euro's for a game like this. Frontier Development tends to heavily discount its games during sales, especially when they have been out for a few years. So if you would like to save money I would wait 1 or 2 years.

Requirements:
☐   Minimum.
☐   Medium.
✅ Fast.
✅ High End.
☐   Super Computer.

Even with a GTX 1660 TI, my game sometimes struggles to hit the 75 fps mark at 2560x1440p. Luckily, the game offers a range of options to lower graphics settings. The larger and more detailed a zoo gets, the worse performance becomes. Make sure you run the latest NVIDIA drivers when you are using an NVIDIA GPU.

Difficulty:
✅ Easy.
☐ Medium.
☐ Hard.
☐ Very Hard.
☐ Death March.
☐ Dark Souls.

This is highly dependable on what you are trying to do in this game. If you are looking for a game that offers you a tool to build the most beautiful zoo possible, this game is a gem. Once you get the hang of the building system in the game, it is very easy to let your creativity go wild. The management aspect can be tedious. Especially during the campaign when you try to achieve certain objectives. In sandbox mode, all management game mechanics can be turned of to make the game more relaxed which allows you to focus on building your ultimate zoo.

Game length:
☐ Really Short. ( 0 - 3 hours)
☐ Short. ( 3 - 8 hours)
☐ Medium. ( 8 - 16 hours)
☐ Long. ( 16 - 25 hours)
☐ Very Long ( 25 - 40 hours)
☐ Extremely Long (40+ hours)
✅Endless

I recently started my first sandbox zoo, after working about 10 hours on this zoo, I am still not finished with the entrance. Yes, I might have OCD.

Story:
☐ It Doesn't Have One.
☐ Horrible.
☐ Meh.
✅ Ok.
☐ Average.
☐ Good.
☐ Fantastic.

It has a small story during campaign mode. very cliche but i like the characters.

Music/Sound:
☐ Horrible.
☐ Decent.
☐ Average.
☐  Good.
✅ Amazing.

I am a big fan of the music in the game, very relaxing. Some games have music that starts to annoy you after a few hours but not this game. Sound effects are amazing and very detailed. I like the fact that you can place boxes around your zoo to create an atmospheric effect.

Gameplay:
☐ Terrible.
☐ Meh.
☐ Ok.
☐ Average.
✅ Good.
☐ Fantastic.

As said before, the building system might be confusing in the beginning, but very handy once understood. Management can be a pain in the ass, but can be turned off.

Bugs:
☐ Game Itself Is One Big BUG.
☐ Game Breaking Bugs.
☐ Lots of bugs.
✅Few Bugs.
☐ Nothing.

This game has its bugs. but nothing major. I find it really annoying how sometimes my animals end up boxed inside their exhibit. Especially monkeys that are climbing over your designed climbing structures can be problematic.

Final:
☐ Terrible.
☐ Meh.
☐ Ok.
☐ Average.
☐ Good.
✅Great.
☐ Fantastic.

Planet zoo is a game that offers you an extreme freedom in building the zoo of your dreams. Management can be annoying and sometimes even frustrating. However, these annoyances can all be turned off in sandbox mode. If you are looking for a game that gives you strategic challenges in running your own business, this game is probably not (yet) for you. however, if you are in it for the building aspect and admiring your animals in your perfectly build zoo, this is the (almost) perfect game.

899770,Last Epoch,"[h1]Here is why I think this game is worth your time and money – right now[/h1]

I like ARPGs since Diablo brought this Genre to life. As a huge Diablo II fan I was waiting for a successor. As many others I was disappointed with Diablo 3. It’s a good game but it cannot follow in the footsteps of D2. Torchlight and Path Of Exile both couldn’t either (for me).

When Last Epoch got my attention I was skeptical towards the presentation of the game. The Graphics were not that impressive and in gameplay videos the combat looked not that smooth.

What convinced me to participate in early access was the Reddit community. There was so much confidence in the skills of the developers and the potential of the game. So I jumped in and I don’t regret it.

[u]I will start with the current issues of the game from my point of view:[/u]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Although the engine got updates and the game looks ok now the game does not look like state of the art right now. LE is not able to compete with Warhammer or Wolcen not to mention Diablo 4 or Path Of Exile 2. The same goes with the physics – not state of the art.

I am sure there will be additional updates and tweaks but I don’t expect LE to transform into a visual blockbuster. 

[b]Gameplay / Combat:[/b]
The combat actually feels not as smooth as in other games. But this is something the devs work on with improving animations, effects and sounds. This definitely will change till full release.

[b]Performance:[/b]
There are many complaints of people with high end systems that the game has low fps and stutters. This is a problem right now that the devs prioritize, but it is not solved, yet. The weird thing is that I don’t have a high end system and are playing at maximum settings without issues – rare fps drops but far away from being unpleasing.

[b]Content:[/b]
Because I am writing this preview about the actual state of the game right now during Beta and Early Access this is an issue. The story is not finished, yet. Not all announced classes are implemented. There is no multiplayer. There is no pvp. The endgame content after completing the game is not implemented. There are two endgame game modes, Monolith and Arena. According to the devs the Arena is just a placeholder and Monolith is not what the devs want it to be when it is finished.

On the LE homepage you can look up what is planned for release. This sounds promising but many of those mechanics are not implemented.

So why do I think that this game is worth its money at its current state? Because the game really has so much potential. [u]Here come the pros that outweigh all the issues:[/u]

[b]Variety of classes:[/b]
There are 5 base classes that divide into 3 sub classes each. Even with the subclasses the playstyle changes drastically within a base class. The classes feel very unique and are very well thought out

[b]Skill trees (Passives):[/b]
There is one passive skill tree for each base class and one additional passive skill tree for each sub class. With every character level you get 1 skill point you can spend in that skill trees. With progression in those skill trees you also unlock active skills that are specific for the subclasses. For Example: By spending points in the Necromancer skill tree (Necro=subclass of Acolyte) you can unlock the skill “Summon Skeleton Mages”.

At some point in the story you have to permanently choose a subclass. This provides some passive bonuses as well as a subclass specific skill. While you can still spend points in all skill trees of a base class you can only choose one profession. This decision is permanent. All passive skill points can be respeced.
The level cap is 100 and there are quests that grant additional skill points.

[b]Skill trees (Skills):[/b]
Every active skill has its own skill tree. These skill nodes provide passive bonuses for the skills like increased critchance, damage and stunchance (and so on..) as well as playstyle changers. For example a melee attack can be altered to be cast at range (Sentinel/Forge Guard - Forge Strike).

You can specialize in 5 skills at a time. You earn skill points by getting xp. But you level your skills separated from your character level (passive skill points). You can respec single skill points or despecialise the complete skill to choose another skill to level. In both cases you lose you progression and have to relevel skill points. But this goes relatively fast and even more the higher your level is.

[b]Variety of builds:[/b]
There are myriads of builds and variations, countless synergies between skills and passives. It’s like an ARPG sandbox where you can build every kind of character you can think of. It’s fun to theory craft exotic builds that are viable at higher levels. This is where the meta game begins.

[b]High complexity:[/b]
LE’s set of rules is very complex. If you take a look at the character sheet you will see 4 tabs of stats (damage, defensive, minion and other stats) with 81 different stats (e.g. health on hit, slow chance, increased minion health generation or spell critical strike multiplier) on top of the general stats like health or fire protections.

There are 7 different damage types and additional defenses like chance to receive a glancing blow or block protection.

To get behind all these mechanics you have to spend a fair amount of time read the tooltips carefully and spend some time on the forums to read some guides and tips.

For me this is the most important argument to play the game. The very high complexity is what makes LE outstanding compared to all other games.

[b]Items / Crafting:[/b]
There are different rarities of items with up to 4 affixes per item that improve its stats. There is a crafting system where you can add affixes to items and / or upgrade them to a certain level.

There are unique items that have stats that change your playstyle or require a specific character alignment to fully develop their potential.

[b]Developers:[/b]
Eleventh Hour Games does an awesome job. The devs are very responsive. They discuss many aspects of the game with the community. They take criticism and suggestions very seriously and react to the player’s opinion.

There is a very good [url=https://forum.lastepochgame.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bcd43769917a08a0cdb7e9f530ab435ca08260d5.png] early access forecast [/url]. They adhere to their deadlines and release patches and updates very regularly. Admittedly EHG delayed the release of LE. But this was for a good reason and was well accepted in the community.

You can feel the spirit and that the devs work on this project with much blood, sweat and tears.

I have no doubt that LE will become a very good ARPG. It’s not mainstream. It is for those people that miss complexity in the Genre and want to dive into a game.

[u]You should buy Last Epoch when:[/u]

294100,RimWorld,"I've been playing this game for the first time and I want to share the story of how I realized it's kind of amazing.

The last of my three original colonists, a female trader named Onesan, died nine years after founding the colony. The story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special. It actually made me a little emotional. None of what I'm going to say is fake, this all happened.

Onesan arrived on the planet with her sister Min, a 16 year old K pop star, and her best friend August, a miner. Min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush. Barely a year after that, August bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony. Onesan broke down often in the early years.

By year three the only person Onesan knew well in the colony was her husband, Steel. Onesan and Steel had gone through a very rocky courtship. It took two years of awkward back and forth flirting before Steel finally won her over. But after three years of marriage, Steel was seduced by another colonist, and Onesan separated from him. Despite Steel's cheating she never broke down again. She couldn't afford to. She was the colony's lead trader and negotiator. Onesan was always busy, constantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby. During the periods when she wasn't on the road, she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony. Steel stayed on his side of the colony, working on armor and weapons. 

For years they rarely ran into each other despite the relatively small size of the colony. Eventually, the relationship with the neighboring colonies changed, and the trade deals began to dry up. After her final return trip, Onesan was suddenly very eager to be with her estranged husband again. It seemed like all the time and distance apart helped her to forgive him. In a strange cosmic coincidence, Steel had broken up with the other colonist while Onesan had been away on her last trip. They got back together, and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had before. 

On the day she died, Onesan was hunting near the edge of the map, far away from the colony. A large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her. Onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before Steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls. 

As the final member of the original colonists and the colony's informal leader, Onesan deserved the best possible funeral. A catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain, and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in. Steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally. It was excellent quality.

He titled the sarcophagus Shadow of Onesan. The description reads:

""The sarcophagus is engraved with a picture of Ryoko 'Onesan' Minase practicing construction skills with visible exhaustion. Hundreds of cowboys watch with amazement. The work seems to represent suffering. The lower part of the image is dominated by a large group of shamans. This representation tells the story of Onesan becoming a master at construction tasks on 5th of Septober, 5509.""

You can see a screenshot I took of it here. https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/781857270461047007/2BD4EB8FCD3C4627D00A25CDB42AC71B4F179355/

I'm not sure why, but Onesan's death did not make Steel upset. I know she was important to him, though. He would leave his work at the machining bench all the time to visit her sarcophagus. He'd always be there for a long time, staring down at it.

1085660,Destiny 2,"[h1]Not free to play...[/h1]
So you want to try Destiny 2? I could easily recommend trying the game out to see if it is your cup of tea; just know the free to play is a lie. Nintendo said it best, this game is truly a ""Free to Start"" game, as soon in you will be hit with pay walls for content. This game runs on 3 player and 6 player activities, keep this in mind if you are playing with friends. Now what do you get with Free to play:

7 ""Open World"" spaces
3 PvE modes
1 Competitive PvE 
3 PvP modes*
2 PvP event
2 Raids
1 Dungeon

[h1]About Bungie[/h1]
When you play a F2P, it is all about the community and the developer, not so much about the game. Bungie has proven themselves to be a worthy developer for this franchise and future ones. They care about their community enough to provide a majority of feedback changes; however they are tone deaf to certain groups in the community. Their focus has definitely shifted from PvP quite a bit since Destiny 1, most of the paid content now is PvE. To be honest a majority plays the PvE so this makes since on the business side. They are completely against gatekeeping, and want all community members to enjoy all aspects of the game. Due to how their development structure is, it can feel like updates aren't arriving in a timely manner to address feedback, which is why the community has so much ire with Bungie.
[h1]The Community[/h1]
Majority of the playerbase for this game are die hard fans of Bungie, and we know what they are capable of, and thus hold them to high standards. Because of this you'll find a majority of the community has a love/hate relationship with the game. Most players are accepting of new players, especially myself I love to show people through their first time with new content and a good majority are. However like any community there is a good portion of the population who are toxic, which has shrunk significantly with the changes Bungie has made. Gatekeeping is one of the biggest topics discussed about the community, and I can say everything you heard is true. 
[h1]The 2%[/h1]
This community has a problem with Gatekeeping content over harsh requirements and generally are xenophobic, primarily at the end-game. The 2% of the community is completely unwilling to teach or have anyone new play the game as they already formed their niches. However this behavior, has been declining massively, I play with the 2% almost regularly and can say this has declined significantly enough that new players should not see this behavior anymore; unless you are unlucky.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bungie has a large focus on making the game-feel be the best it can be. They love to recycle content, it is kind of their thing, but they like to do it in creative ways to make it feel fresh. If it ain't broke. Most will be turned off by that, but realistically you play a Bungie game for that solid gameplay, and if they added new content that is a nice bonus. They usually take a long time to perfect this game feel, which really hampers their development time considerably. If you been looking for FPSs that ""feel"" great to play, than you came to the right place. However the physics engine is extremely dated, and is due for a massive upgrade; which Bungie is aware of physics issues. 
[h1]My recommendations[/h1]
If you get into this game and decide to purchase any expansion content, I made reviews for each one with the lens of a new player in mind. But if you want my top recommendations, I would say Lightfall or Witch Queen are great start for players, each one however has it's own focus that I'd recommend reading my reviews on. Lightfall for the gameplay, Witch Queen for the Story. 

[h1]Strikes[/h1]
Strikes are pretty mind numbing, which Bungie has realized this and have mixed in seasonal content into the playlist. However it is still possibly one of their most mind numbing experiences, closely tied to patrols
[h1]GM/Nightfalls[/h1]
Do you enjoy dying in 1 hit? Dealing with bullet spongy enemies? Than this mode is just strikes, but beefed up to ridiculous levels. GMs are gatekept heavily by both Bungie, and the community; they are the hardest activity to get into. 
[h1]Patrols/Open World[/h1]
The open world spaces can range heavily, from highly detailed with secrets, to barren wastelands with no content in them. Generally newer content has focused on keeping these areas interesting with more secrets to discover.
[h1]Crucible[/h1]
PvP has improved, however a majority of PvP in this game is making builds that ruin the fun for everyone else, with 1 hit mechanics and other annoying things. However if you are the one dishing it out, it can feel like a power trip. PvP functions similarly to arena shooters with a loadout system, no weapons appear on the map, but they try to emulate that with Heavy ammo spawns.
[h1]Gambit[/h1]
Bungie's red-headed step child game type, a competitive PvE mode. 2 Teams race to kill a boss before the other one does. The mode can be fun, but matchmaking really ruins this gametype if you cannot get good matches.
[h1]Trials[/h1]
This mode is the one you hear streamers talk about the most, the pinnacle PvP activity. This mode is generally full of sweaty try hards who gatekeep the lighthouse from anyone who dares to try to go flawless.
[h1]Iron Banner[/h1]
A timed PvP event, which honestly is when the most creative builds come out for PvP. Iron Banner is definitely an experience that I think every player should try once since it is a time when most players don't try to run ""meta"" loadouts. 
[h1]Dungeons[/h1]
Dungeons are like diet raids, they are full of puzzles that are pretty simple to comprehend and are limited to 3 players. They can give you a taste of what end-game content is like.
[h1]Raids[/h1]
The pinnacle of end-game, not as hard as other games that have ""Raid-like"" events. Each raid plays differently, I usually compare raids to playing a custom game in Halo 3, as it has the same kind of feel as one. Bungie keeps their raids relatively simple to comprehend, however they are challenging, and I recommend any new player try to do one at least once; with a team that wants to teach.

[h1]The verdict[/h1]
Since this game is ""F2P"" I can easily recommend that you try it out and see if you like it first, what do you have to lose? I can recommend Destiny 2 to anyone who is looking for a FPS game to pass time or are tired of playing shooters that just don't feel right. As Bungie continues to curate content to remove the gatekeeping from the game, I hope to see that 2% go up even higher as new talent try this game, and decide they are up for the challenge.",h1 free play h1 want try destiny 2 could easily recommend trying game see cup tea know free play lie nintendo said best game truly free start game soon hit pay wall content game run 3 player 6 player activity keep mind playing friend get free play 7 open world space 3 pve mode 1 competitive pve 3 pvp mode 2 pvp event 2 raid 1 dungeon content rotator change almost daily h1 bungie h1 play f2p community developer much game bungie proven worthy developer franchise future one care community enough provide majority feedback change however tone deaf certain group community focus definitely shifted pvp quite bit since destiny 1 paid content pve honest majority play pve make since business side completely gatekeeping want community member enjoy aspect game due development structure feel like update arriving timely manner address feedback community much ire bungie h1 community h1 majority playerbase game die hard fan bungie know capable thus hold high standard find majority community love hate relationship game player accepting new player especially love show people first time new content good majority however like community good portion population toxic shrunk significantly change bungie made gatekeeping one biggest topic discussed community say everything heard true h1 2 h1 community problem gatekeeping content harsh requirement generally xenophobic primarily end game 2 community completely unwilling teach anyone new play game already formed niche however behavior declining massively play 2 almost regularly say declined significantly enough new player see behavior anymore unless unlucky h1 gameplay h1 bungie large focus making game feel best love recycle content kind thing like creative way make feel fresh broke turned realistically play bungie game solid gameplay added new content nice bonus usually take long time perfect game feel really hamper development time considerably looking fps feel great play came right place however physic engine extremely dated due massive upgrade bungie aware physic issue h1 recommendation h1 get game decide purchase expansion content made review one lens new player mind want top recommendation would say lightfall witch queen great start player one however focus recommend reading review lightfall gameplay witch queen story h1 strike h1 strike pretty mind numbing bungie realized mixed seasonal content playlist however still possibly one mind numbing experience closely tied patrol h1 gm nightfall h1 enjoy dying 1 hit dealing bullet spongy enemy mode strike beefed ridiculous level gm gatekept heavily bungie community hardest activity get h1 patrol open world h1 open world space range heavily highly detailed secret barren wasteland content generally newer content focused keeping area interesting secret discover h1 crucible h1 pvp improved however majority pvp game making build ruin fun everyone else 1 hit mechanic annoying thing however one dishing feel like power trip pvp function similarly arena shooter loadout system weapon appear map try emulate heavy ammo spawn h1 gambit h1 bungie red headed step child game type competitive pve mode 2 team race kill bos one mode fun matchmaking really ruin gametype get good match h1 trial h1 mode one hear streamer talk pinnacle pvp activity mode generally full sweaty try hards gatekeep lighthouse anyone dare try go flawless h1 iron banner h1 timed pvp event honestly creative build come pvp iron banner definitely experience think every player try since time player try run meta loadouts h1 dungeon h1 dungeon like diet raid full puzzle pretty simple comprehend limited 3 player give taste end game content like h1 raid h1 pinnacle end game hard game raid like event raid play differently usually compare raid playing custom game halo 3 kind feel one bungie keep raid relatively simple comprehend however challenging recommend new player try one least team want teach h1 verdict h1 since game f2p easily recommend try see like first lose recommend destiny 2 anyone looking fps game pas time tired playing shooter feel right bungie continues curate content remove gatekeeping game hope see 2 go even higher new talent try game decide challenge

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"[h1] TL;DR: It's good but has bugs. Caveat Emptor. [/h1]

Dying Light 2 starts fresh and while it references the first game in its series plenty, it didn't allow itself to be written into a corner by what may have been holding Dying Light 1 back. I obtained the Deluxe edition for £80 and this is what I've found.

[b]Content.[/b]

The voice acting was alright, even good at times. Jonah Scott does a great job, but the story is neither here nor there. It could be a lot worse, but it could be a lot better, too. I don't think anyone is here for a good story, though. The story is just there to pad the world out, make it feel more alive. It serves that purpose just fine. We're here for the parkour, we're here for the zombies, and on this front Techland really delivers. I hope they'll bring back ""Be The Zombie"" mode. I felt like the mode fell a little flat in Dying Light 1 so if they do I hope they bring something fresh.

[b]Lore.[/b]

In the first one, almost everyone was infected and needed to take antizen to stave off the infection. I believe this was done so that the player could be bitten by a zombie without turning and having people wonder why the player character didn't turn. It's also a good way of avoiding the old cliché of the protagonist being immune. However, on the downside, you never physically saw the protagonist taking antizen, and it also wasn't a mechanic that you needed to manage.
In Dyling Light 2, everyone is infected by a different strain of the virus and this time UV light staves off the infection. So it uses the same concept but in this case you physically have to keep fighting the infection using sunlight or UV light. It's easy enough to manage and actually feels more like a slight inconvenience, but that mindset has got me caught with my pants down a few times where I didn't keep an eye on the timer and had to run for UV-light. You can actually carry around UV-glowsticks that'll work in a pinch, so when I get a bit further into the game and get better equipped this mechanic won't even be an issue.

[b]Technical.[/b]

I've experienced quite a few bugs, and several game breaking bugs. A few zombie corpses started T-posing on me, a few times I didn't hear audio, I've had enemies wander around inside cutscenes, once it even skipped an objective for a mission for me. I've had missions that I was unable to progress in because of a soft lock which resolved itself after I abandoned it and tried a different mission instead. I was forced to close my game once when I was instructed to scout Jack & Joe's camp using binoculars only it wouldn't unequip the binoculars no matter what I did. Force-closing the game in this instance caused me to lose a lot of progress.

When it comes to video game developers you should not trust promises but rather look at their track record to determine their integrity. With the bugs I've found I would normally suggest you do not buy it, at least until those bugs are fixed. However, with Techland I feel reassured that these bugs will be fixed in due time. This is because Dying Light 1 got support for years through multiple DLCs and a plethora of updates and bug-fixes. It's up to you if you want to trust that the bugs will be addressed and buy it while it's essentially a late stage early-access, but I'm pretty confident in my purchase.

I have 16 hours at the time of writing this, so it's up to you to decide whether or not that's long enough to have gotten a feel for the game and write an accurate review, but I'll be playing it much longer and I'll update this review accordingly.

Update:

Since this review got some attention, I'd like to provide an update with my experiences now that I've finished the story. Spoilers ahead.

[spoiler] The story, again, is mediocre and the gameplay is what it's all about. I assigned all of my territory to the Survivors to improve my experience with the parkour system and considering the Peacekeeper's zone upgrades it was the right choice. The best thing the Peacekeepers offer you is a UV trap which is a little redundant when you're carrying around UV glowsticks and have a safezone around almost every corner.

I appreciate that Techland really tried to make the modern ""NO, I am your father!""-twist at the end of the story but honestly it really falls flat when [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blwz1prous] THIS [/url] is the bossfight that follows... 

I also wish that they had opted to spend more time in development to allow players to choose whether they want to play as Aiden or Mia. Considering the fact that they could have easily switched places and have the story still make sense. The structure to facilitate this player choice is there and what I suspect is that this was intentional because they planned to give the player this choice but ended up cutting it out due to budget or time constraints. It's a small complaint but I'd have really liked to give all players a chance to associate with their characters more. 

I also feel like Aiden's flirtatious attitude towards Lawan is utterly shoehorned in. In the end I chose to save Lawan, not because I wanted to save Lawan, but because I feel like Aiden's entire purpose was to reunite with Mia and I believe he would have done so at the cost of the entire city. Especially when Waltz promises a cure for Mia and the rest of humanity. Even if he doesn't deliver the cure, so far this is the only way I could think of that the game would allow me to kill Dodger and Klaus. They hurt my poor Hubie.[/spoiler]

Update #2:

I am now on my second playthrough to experience a different ending, and unfortunately I have to say that the bug I experienced in my first playthrough where a bunch of my progress was wiped happened again. This time I was not forced to force-close the game but actually closed the game properly. Right around the quest 'Unruly Brother' I found the same issues I did on my first playthrough, where I would be unable to progress in the main story quest unless I first did another side quest to force the game to check and update the journal again to recognise that the main quest requirements for progression had been satisfied.

When I closed the game by going through the main menu it instead just closed the game and I lost a bunch of progression yet again. I had hoped that in my first playthrough these issues were just a fluke and perhaps even unique to my experience. But it seems that this bug happens consistently. Let me reiterate this so that you may keep this in mind when making your purchase; This game's state is essentially a late-stage early access. This game is not complete.

As a final note I have to mention the free DLC packs. Why is it given to us in 3 parts when this DLC in its entirety isn't more than just a single outfit? Why are the stats on these items no longer relevant after 2 hours? Why not just release it as a cosmetic skin instead? Thank you but this is worthless. I get that Techland probably had these outfits ready around the time they released the game and are now drip-feeding the content to maintain the playerbase's intrigue and the release's momentum, but this is time they could've spent fixing the countless gamebreaking bugs.

552990,World of Warships,"I'm very skeptical of most of the reviews of this game as a long time player.

Here is the story of Wold of Warships. There was once a fun naval arcade game where you took pixel boats out and fought each other. It wasn't perfect but it was an enjoyable game. All the 3 main classes (Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship) all had their roles, and had a good meta game. Destroyers are the kind of sneaky low HP guys that are fast. Battleships are the big slow brawler type. Cruiser is someplace in the middle. The game was good, all the main classes had strengths and weaknesses. Aircraft carriers (CVs) existed but were difficult to play and largely ignored. 

Then the CV rework happened.

The CV rework changed CVs drastically. We now have units in the game that can sit out of range of anything, with totally different mechanics, that basically just ignore what is going on and impose their will however they want.  You can not defend against the class as anti-aircraft fire is basically worthless. You can't out maneuver a CV because their planes are so much faster and more nimble. You can not outplay a CV player whom is not brain dead, period. The class is so broken if you have anymore than 1 on each side in a game, it simply becomes a nightmare for most of the players. Basically this class doesn't belong in the game, period. Whomever came up with the new CV mechanics is smoking moon rocks. Then rather admit the rework was basically just keep pushing them because failure is not an option. 

This is only one of the major issues with the game. 

On top of this, the game is structured in such a way to cause to frustration either though limited resources or long grinding in order to get you to buy stuff. I'm not really against this part but after you play a while you will realize how much of this game is aimed at whales. There is a non-stop amount of new ships, even though they are broken and not tested half the time, or special events to get players to spend money on top the already aggressive monetization system.

I mean they have events where they release new ships a month before you can get them in the game tech trees to get people to spend virtual money to buy them ahead of time. These ships cost a lot of money. I've watched people spend $150 to get a ship early. There is no bounds to the amount of money you can spend on this game if you want.

I do not care that they want to monetize the game but high level ships you can buy cost $50+, we are talking AAA game cost for 1 ship. There are other special high end ships that require a resource like in XP, where if you where to buy the XP to buy the ship it would cost $300+. Even after buying a ship then the game still screws you, as you need a captain to go along with it. Now if you want your captain to have skills you will either have to play the captain a lot, or spend a bunch of money to level them on your ship you just shelled out for. If you want to level them even faster you can buy flags, and camos that give you more captain XP. They also basically doubled the captain XP cap earlier this year to make it even worse.

I guess my point it it never feels like when I have shelled out money into the game that I can just play the game. I have always felt ""milked"". It feels like it never ends. There are too many ways to shell out for this game.

You're probably saying ""Well Rage, you've played 650 hours how bad can it be?"" Look I've played and had some fun, but overall I've had a lot of not fun watching the game continue to erode what I thought made it great in the past. To be fair it could still be a great game but never will be unless there are leadership changes at Wargaming.

Me recommending this game is like me telling you to get into an abusive relationship, because that is what it is.

I've played this game long enough to know this:

Wargaming does not care about the players. 
Wargaming does not care about balancing the game.
Wargaming does not care about making the game competitive.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"Edit: 
Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.

Previous Review:
This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.
Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.

1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. 

This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.

2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission).

 Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).
(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)

1260320,Party Animals,"Okay listen, the ""monetization"" is not terrible as some people try to paint it. It is nothing new or controversial, you have an in-game currency (very easy to get) and premium currency (which you also get in-game for free).

There is NO battle pass (as of writing this review), no predatory or intrusive ads in your face, nothing that would render the game unplayable or less enjoyable. Some people just like to cry about every game lately.

They did this at this specific time in the month deliberately as employee benefits last only until the end of the month. A lot of employees had unvested shares because of the Sony acquisition as part of staying with the company, but now those shares go back to Bungie.

The employees found that they had been fired on the day they had to leave. Some team managers were not told who on their team had been fired. Some employees were seen crying at their desks by other employees who were also fired who have spoken up about it anonymously. Employees were not allowed to say goodbye or exchange contact details.

The ""Light and Darkness"" saga comes to an end. A sci-fi, fictional story about standing up to the darkness, to evil, and fighting for the light, for what is good. It's ironic that in the real world Bungie are the darkness getting rid of those who have been part of the company's identity for years - decades even, and who have been instrumental in shaping a lot of our favourite memories we have of Destiny. But it's over now.

We blamed Microsoft for Bungie's problems, then we blamed Activision for Bungie's problems and before we can blame Sony for Bungie's problems it's revealed that it's Bungie who are responsible for Bungie's problems and great hard-working talented people have to pay the price for bad management.

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"+ Very nice maps*
+ Decent animals (look great, behave somewhat realistic most of the time)
+ Very convincing soundscape (mostly)
+ Luring animals with calls
+ Animals make some scary noises
+ Some animals can be aggressive (although some like bears could be a bit more)
+ New scoring system is more fair
+ Coop is usually working like it should
+ Quite some DLCs but no microshit (rare for this genre)
+ Tracking by inspecting literal sh!t
- Weapons are somewhat shallow, callibers don't really fit well with eachother performance wise**
- Very limited zeroing (3 step) only unlockable by 2(!) perks
- Only a couple of scopes with quite a grind to unlock them, and the same for each weapon class (although you only need to unlock them once)
- Some common hunting attachments missing like supressors
- Some basic features like freelook missing
- No immersion stuff like compass and watch or something like that
- No skinning, cooking, eating
- Some ambient bird sounds are really loud, keep playing and even seem to move with player
- Sleeping costs money (not a lot, but still)
- Water cant be traversed, can be really annoying (canoes would be great in some maps like Layton and Yukon)
- Weather sometimes changes like every minute
- Game could use some more birds on the various maps
- No dogs, would be interesting to track animals without the glowing but with dog. (23-11-20)
- UPDATE 23-10-2021: meanwhile dogs have been added, did not try them yet but they appear to be appreciated

My advise would be, walk around, map need zones by following tracks, dont expect to walk into animals when making a lot of noise. Then when you have some interesting zones, try to ambush them at the right time (especially drink zones).

*Map ranking;
Somewhat personal but I wouldnt recommend the last three unless you are looking for their specific species. I feel like Vurhonga, Cuatro and Parque are a bit bland terrain wise, just a heightmap with vegetation. However Vurhonga adds a lot of unique species, and the openess kinda fits the theme. Silver Peaks is nice but doesnt add a lot of new things, Medved has also some overlap but has a really unique atmosphere. Yukon also has some double species but the terrain is really epic and also features some dynamic weather.

YES
1. Yukon
2. Medved
3. Vurhonga

MAYBE
4. Silver Peaks

NOT REALLY

899770,Last Epoch,"BETA RELEASE REVIEW

It's a fun ARPG, in the genre of Diablo mixed with a part of Grim Dawn and a part of Path of Exile.  Currently there are 4 classes, with the Rogue class still in it's initial phase of development without a timeframe for release yet.  You still have the opportunity to play as Acolyte, Primalist, Mage, and Sentinel.  These are the typical base classes you find in these games, with each one having three Mastery choices.

Many of the builds currently stress damage mitigation and health, with most of the character builds being fleshed out to their highest efficiency way before you reach cap level.  So basically, between level 50-75 you'll most likely have your skills maxed and already have either bis gear or near it.  That leaves little incentive to continue on to cap level 100 for an occasional passive point to reward your effort.  There isn't an endgame currently either, making it even less desirable to continue on with the character.  You'll probably get more enjoyment by starting a new character with a new build you want to try out.  Hoping to see this being fixed way before full release.

For the storyline and quests, it's quite intriguing I have to say.  Not to give too much of it away, but you'll be sort of a time traveler, opening portals to different eras (or epochs as in the game title) from the infancy of humanity to the year 2281, The Ruined Era or Last Epoch.  This is where your story begins.

I have had a few bugs so far while playing, nothing too serious, but it could of been.  When breaking tables and furniture with your weapons there's chance that money or even gear will drop.  On a few occasions I've had my drops either floating in the air or outside the play area without any way for me to recover them.  Luckily the weapons and armor were not Unique or Set items, and the amount of gold was negligible.

Another issue that has happened twice so far, when entering an area or trying to speak to a npc, the game suddenly would just freeze as the camera view changed.  I was left with no other choice but to alt tab out and do a manual exit of the game.  Nothing too serious so far, and it is still in beta after all.

I still only scratched the surface of the game to date, but plan to continue on playing throughout the beta phase and hopefully see a completed released version of the game in the near future.  It's definitely worth buying into if you're a fan of the ARPG genre, and I do have a good feeling about this one.  Same way I felt that Grim Dawn was going to become a great released game when I started playing that game at beta.",beta release review fun arpg genre diablo mixed part grim dawn part path exile currently 4 class rogue class still initial phase development without timeframe release yet still opportunity play acolyte primalist mage sentinel typical base class find game one three mastery choice many build currently stress damage mitigation health character build fleshed highest efficiency way reach cap level basically level 50 75 likely skill maxed already either bi gear near leaf little incentive continue cap level 100 occasional passive point reward effort endgame currently either making even le desirable continue character probably get enjoyment starting new character new build want try hoping see fixed way full release storyline quest quite intriguing say give much away sort time traveler opening portal different era epoch game title infancy humanity year 2281 ruined era last epoch story begin bug far playing nothing serious could breaking table furniture weapon chance money even gear drop occasion drop either floating air outside play area without way recover luckily weapon armor unique set item amount gold negligible another issue happened twice far entering area trying speak npc game suddenly would freeze camera view changed left choice alt tab manual exit game nothing serious far still beta still scratched surface game date plan continue playing throughout beta phase hopefully see completed released version game near future definitely worth buying fan arpg genre good feeling one way felt grim dawn going become great released game started playing game beta

2195250,EA SPORTS FC™ 24,"[h3]Background[/h3]

I [b]have prior experience[/b] playing and enjoying football simulators, and this isn't my first encounter with the genre or the specific franchise. As a football enthusiast, my expectations were quite low, especially after reading some reviews. Nevertheless, I approached the game with interest and hope for a positive surprise. However, I [b]cannot recommend this game[/b] unless you fall into a very specific group of people, which I will elaborate on in this review.

Let's delve into the three most prominent game modes, which essentially encompass about 99% of the game's content.

[h3]Ultimate Team[/h3]

If you've ever witnessed people playing slots in Las Vegas, this mode might evoke similar feelings of shame and disgust. It's advisable to reconsider and [b]seek help[/b] if you find yourself going down this path.

[h3]Career Mode[/h3]

This mode should constitute the majority of your gameplay if you lean towards a power trip style of play. Progress, change leagues, build a team, win titles, and more. You even have the flexibility to adjust sliders and difficulty for a challenging experience against the computer.

[h3]Clubs[/h3]

On paper, this mode appears highly promising. You can choose a role, team up with friends, play together, lead your team to higher leagues, claim trophies, enhance your character, customize appearance and skills to match your gameplay, and compete against other teams. Sounds super fun, right? Well, here's the catch...

[h3]The Catch - Main Thesis[/h3]

The game is [b]evidently flawed[/b]. While it claims to be a football simulator, it's more of an [b]exploit simulator[/b]. If you don't conform to the prevailing trends in team composition and player abilities, centered around what is exploitable, you'll find yourself unable to compete against those who do. YOU WILL LOSE. Learning and executing exploits becomes a necessity, and while there are numerous tutorial videos available, succumbing to this approach can ruin the overall gaming experience.

Allow me to provide some examples that resonate with around 90% of the player base. The game's current form, and as per discussions with other players, past and possibly future iterations, is highly exploitable. Consequently, you'll witness only three types of goals in this so-called football simulator.

1 - Players exploiting the sides of the pitch, executing either a cross (Beckham's to Ronaldo vs Zaragoza) or a series of cheap passes systematically positioned between your defenders.

2 - A finesse/trivela kick from the corner of the box (Quaresma style), always resulting in a goal due to a bug in goalkeeper positioning.

3 - A messy first-post header from a corner, forcing you to move the goalkeeper around the box while the opponent reverts to the aforementioned alternatives.

While you may score and witness hundreds of goals like these, the game's rigidity to these play styles and game-breaking mechanics eradicates the sense of being immersed in a football simulator. It feels more like a game of [b]""exploit or perish.""[/b]

[h3]To wrap it up[/h3]

Frankly, I anticipated much more from the purported best-in-industry and expensive game. This disappointment isn't solely based on the gameplay; it extends to actual bugs involving matchmaking, glitched menus, automatic configuration reverting, uniform malfunctions, a community rife with sore losers resorting to excessive sliding tackles and leaving matches when behind, glitched animations, inexplicable computer decisions, alleged handicapping of matches, and other issues that my friends and I endured to play this game.

In summary, and being entirely candid, I [b]strongly advise against[/b] subjecting yourself to this experience.

[h3]That being said...[/h3]

... there's one exception though: if you happen to be a die-hard fan of the franchise for decades, maintaining a close-knit group of friends who play it year after year, regardless of the game's price or condition.

582660,Black Desert,"Black Desert Online is a fantastic idea and world setting, the combat is immersive with a high skill cap, the character creation is the best of any game released to date, its enhancing system is horrid while still being extremely unique and what keeps people playing, and the game looks absolutely stunning with a welcoming community.

Black Desert Online's enhancing system is the games pinnacle as well as its downfall, while the enhancing system FEELS extremely rewarding when an enhancement succeeds you still end up losing millions on that enhancement. The games accessories break when an enhancement is failed unless cron stones are used (We'll cover these later) This means that if you have a boss gear accessory that is Tri(+18) and attempt to go to tet(+19) and your enhancement fails you've potentially lost BILLIONS of silver. The same applies to weapons but usually its just hundreds of millions not billions(Unless we're discussing a pen(+20) attempt) This will allow us to discuss the next topic. THE GRIND

Black Desert Online is an EXTREMELY grind heavy game. You will need to spend hundreds of hours playing to reach softcap(253ap(Damage) The grind is extremely tedious as there aren't a whole lot of decent grinding zones. You'll be stuck in the same spot or region for quite a significant time before being able to move on to another area when you meet its recommended AP. You will grind for silver to enhance your gear or to buy pearl shop items(We'll discuss these next) Which are REQUIRED(unless you want to spend more than 10 hours per day grinding mobs and making trips) to progress in the game with decent Silver per hour. You can lifeskill but it will be a large money sink as most lifeskills are extremely tedious and in-efficient without pearl items to assist you in success rate/swimming speed/breathing time/gathering speed/ and processing success rate. Which transitions us into our next topic, Pearl items

Pearl items are almost a must have if you plan on playing bdo seriously, this means investing losts of money into the game (about $200 for mob grinders and $400-$600 for lifeskillers) All these items are pay for convenience, Kakao makes its game unbearable without these pearl shop items. A must for all players is Pets, at least tier 2 for all of them(about $60-$80) Pets are absolutely necessary to your success in this game, they will loot items for you as well as give you boosts to certain xp values or knowledge gain chance. Lifeskillers, you're going to have to spend money on at least one pearl shop costume that are NOT able to be listed on the marketplace for silver. These costumes run about $22 USD and are essential for lifeskillers. This game is pay to win when it comes to maintaining a higher skill score. Outfit sets(cosmetic items that boost xp stats that are a pearl shop item BUT can be purchased from the marketplace using precious silver that could be going to enhancing) Can be melted down for CRON stones. Cron stones protect the enhancement level on an item from dropping on a failed enhancement chance or prevent an accessory from breaking on a failed enhancement. Which means, spending IRL money will save you potentially BILLIONS of silver that can be used to enhance other gear. Another ptw item from the item shop is Artisans memories. What these do is they make an item restore 4x their value on a repair. Meaning someone that spends money on these spends 4x less on repair materials for their boss gear which is extremely substantial. 

While Black Desert Online is a great online game for some, it is essentially having a second job and sinking every waking moment into this game if you have plans to progress, I can not recommend this game to the average gamer despite how much I enjoy it. The enhancing system is this games downfall and its rise, the pay to win is too much handle if you're a ftp player and Kakao is a greedy company out for that dough. If you like grind maybe this game is for you(I'm okay with the grind but find myself taking breaks lasting for a few months before picking the game up again).

990080,Hogwarts Legacy,"[h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]
[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]


Sometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....

Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.

I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.

The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.

[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613


[h1]Story:[/h1]
So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.

First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.

Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.

Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.

If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  

Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! 


[h1]The Combat:[/h1]

What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. 

Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. 

For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.
The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.

As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.


[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]

There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.
I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! 


[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]

Just wow!  
Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.


[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]

I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!


[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]

Simply magical!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8
I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]",h1 dream every potterhead want become one h1 b u spoiler free review u b sometimes game getting released way much hype forspoken example would game either bad optimization misinformation studio disappointment end immeasurable people already pre ordered game people game wishlist month sadly lot lately even get started license game general hogwarts legacy hand show sometimes hype train true usually pre order game anymore premise best game based fantastic world harry potter made buy instant following review contain spoiler also want mention even close end game way much fun exploring also know controversy part review even meme http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 2929913613 h1 story h1 far good start generic chosen one scenario going get better better go trust one want give away many information say story fit hp universe well game would book able stop reading end h1 gameplay h1 overwhelming would right word many mechanic game amazing exhausting time first exploration part move around freely explore every inch hogwarts surroundings tell lot discover collect mystery need solved lock need picked information special place need gathered amount collectible insane likely spent hour hour getting everything 100 puzzle find well made solving fun main quest side quest really love side quest one involve fellow student learn know bit better every time quest creative also get exp fighting enemy get exp discovering new location mini game thing like want get one point map also use floo powder fast travel service use good old broom prefer last one feel great fly around enjoy world might even sometimes happens fly around aimlessly fun decorating crafting fantastic beast going part game well would way spoilery mention anything h1 combat h1 would wizard witch without magical wand time might using puzzle lighten area scanning surroundings go stronger enemy face good start learn attack defense spell soon might handful key combine hit enemy 3 basic spell pull towards hit 3 time set flame push back hit one different combo cause different effect combining make stronger learn combo well also free experiment fighting enemy also never get old might shield need right spell break others dealt get attacked fire defense also use shield spell dodge roll danger zone clear really deflect power attack troll something soul like also come parry button go upgrade spell well extra effect power sidenote also need fight time want always option sneak past enemy silently stun h1 rpg part h1 much rpg game hoped would negative point feel like really control quest story outcome dialogue mean friendly much difference wished would might get gold quest asking better reward blackmailing also fit overall appearance cut scene mean create character choose house want join also skill tree thats want throw voice actor amazing work h1 atmosphere h1 wow hogwarts alone gigantic feel amazing get lost beautifully handcrafted unique hall room dungeon living painting ghost student running around hall atmospheric neighboring village landmark trick maybe want walk way hogsmeade drink butter beer lose weird looking fascinating architecture building even get started forbidden forest location would able recognize movie book h1 graphic h1 play game mix medium low i7 4790 1060 6 gb game still look amazing passionate screenarcher screenshoter able make good screenshots game playing enough fps stable never noticed pop in texture loading unreal engine 4 wonderful job show good still compared ue5 h1 soundtrack h1 simply magical http www youtube com watch v naesuw6qzu8 also love mix new composed song soundtrack movie feel right h1 conclusion h1 u know want already goty single game last month kept occupied excuse collect thing potion maybe get lost way random ruin hunting treasure u
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I have been playing this game for over 5 years. From PS3 to PC.

I have never cheated or used hacks/mods. And suddenly Rockstar decided to ban me for no reason.

Once my ban is lifted, 5 years worth of progress will be gone.

If they won't rectify this issue, I'm going to turn this into a full-blown media scandal.

EDIT:
Just in case my claim sounds dubious, here's what I was doing in the 24-hours before I got banned:

- I just received the Stone Hatchet and completed the 25-kills challenge (and didn't receive the 250,000 GTA$ bonus for it).
- I received the 750,000 GTA$ moneydrop for watching the official livestream event (https://www.facebook.com/rockstargames/posts/10156559856180097).
- I was promoting my Nightclub and waiting for my supplies to fill up.
- I logged out to take a nap for a couple of hours.
- I woke up, tried to log in again, but the Social Club verification was taking too long, so I quit out of the game and restart.
- When I restart the game, I received the message that my account has been banned for 30 days.

I have sent multiple messsages to Rockstar Support, but all of my tickets were closed immediately with a preformatted response:

- ""You did something wrong but we won't tell you exactly what you did.""
- ""Your account will be reset: Character, Money, EVERYTHING.""
- ""This is final and cannot be appealed.""

So, yes, I'm being banned for something I didn't do and the punishment is 5 years worth of LEGITIMATE PROGRESS, gone.",playing game 5 year ps3 pc never cheated used hack mod suddenly rockstar decided ban reason ban lifted 5 year worth progress gone rectify issue going turn full blown medium scandal edit case claim sound dubious 24 hour got banned received stone hatchet completed 25 kill challenge receive 250 000 gta bonus received 750 000 gta moneydrop watching official livestream event http www facebook com rockstargames post 10156559856180097 promoting nightclub waiting supply fill logged take nap couple hour woke tried log social club verification taking long quit game restart restart game received message account banned 30 day sent multiple messsages rockstar support ticket closed immediately preformatted response something wrong tell exactly account reset character money everything final appealed yes banned something punishment 5 year worth legitimate progress gone

The game is a korean grinder with a somewhat aggressive cash shop, so depends if you know your limits or not.

Game is not a theme park mmo, so as soon as you are done with the tutorial story you need to decide what you want to do, this is a problem for some since they need to be led about.

This game is a completely open world mmo so you can actually pick a direction and go there, you don't need to finish all the story to unlock different areas of the map, although you may get walloped :D
Following the black spirit quest line as a new player is the best idea, with a season character.

However there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do and grind for, as the veterans always say BDO is a marathon not a sprint.

The main thing that first attracted me to BDO was the horse training which is surprisingly complicated, the horse animations and skills are very satisfying to use. The mounts also don't spawn out of your characters butt like in most games, when you dismount they are still there in the world, which I think is wonderfully immersive. 
There is also all the other usual lifeskills such as gathering, farming, cooking, alchemy, sailing, fishing, hunting, trading and bartering.

Gaming the economy is not really a thing in this game since max and min price of things is managed by the developers, there is also no player trading so don't expect it to be like EVE or ARCHEAGE in this respect.
BDO also has a pretty good housing system with lots of choices of house locations for convenience, roleplay or simple looks reasons and lots of choices when it comes to furniture items. 
Also there is no large inital cost or lack of housing, and no loss of said house/houses when you have a break from the game, everything is how you left it when you return.
Almost all the cash shop furniture can now be crafted for free now, which is amazing.

The action combat is first rate, I think of all the mmos I have played only TERA has better combat, BDO's mob grinding is better though. 
Which is just as well since grinding mobs is a huge part of the game and can be a decider as to whether you will like the game or not. (nothing like putting on some music and killing thousands of critters)

This game doesn't do dungeons like most mmos do, it has only 3 which are parts of the same dungeon.
Visually they are lovely but I think mechanically they are clunky and the reliance on having to use guides is a problem.
If you have played WOW, Final fantasy or Destiny 2 you will find these raids disappointing in comparison.

BDO has never been known for its story and it still isn't, some of the newest story content is fully voiced and is quite good, however unfortunately some of the earliest story/tutorial is a real slog.

Also the quality of life in this game is through the roof, every option you can think of for turning stuff off or on, or adjusting UI. 
Search bars for items/npcs and all items have a proper description and will have a auto path to the npc they need to go to, on a right click.
The autopathing is a pleasure, the knowledge system is great and contributes to your entire account. 
All of your alts have access to almost everything on your account; storage/mounts/pets, its just one big Family, which is very convenient.

Gearing is actually way easier than it was when I started playing in 2017; with the season servers, its almost obscene how much easier it is now, with benefits new and old players alike, a very good change. 
The upgrading of gear and the system of doing it are pretty complicated and much complained about but the season servers really do act as a great tutorial for how to works and if you'd prefer to just avoid it and just grind and buy what you want from the marketplace.

Cosmetics are some of the best and most detailed in any mmo however the best of them are in the cashshop, so be aware of that if it bothers you. 
The game is very cheap to buy or often free to try with no subscription requirement I don't think its a big deal, there is also ones you can get with a loyalty system/giveaways if you can be patient.
The dye system is extremely good and has many slots to achieve that specific look and is one of the main reasons its nice to have the optional subscription; The value pack.
If you are going to play the value pack is definitely worth having and has a lot of convenience. 
However the game has no required subscription, so you can just login whenever you feel like it.

The character creation is still one of the best in any mmo or even more modern games, which is kinda crazy and you can completely change your characters face or hair if you get sick of it, provided you have the value pack.

BDO is probably the best most complete open world/seamless mmo on the market, only New world looks better graphically.
The areas of the map look like they fit together naturally like they would in real life, some of the cities are actually modelled off real cities.

One thing I like is there is a distinct style as well, they don't try to do everything; horses are the primary mount, very little fast travel; so mounts are actually useful, and no true flying mounts either just gliding. 
The amount of crazy MMO stuff isn't outrageous either, no crazy mounts; flying cars/robots/giraffe monstrosities or ridiculous outfits like final fantasy/Tera. just some usual mmo suspects, battle lingerie being the main culprit, which i'm not opposed to ;)

BDO is one of those games either you love it or hate it, or its a bit of both and you are waiting for a new mmo that never arrives...",10k hour thing game korean grinder somewhat aggressive cash shop depends know limit game theme park mmo soon done tutorial story need decide want problem since need led game completely open world mmo actually pick direction go need finish story unlock different area map although may get walloped following black spirit quest line new player best idea season character however overwhelming amount stuff grind veteran always say bdo marathon sprint main thing first attracted bdo horse training surprisingly complicated horse animation skill satisfying use mount also spawn character butt like game dismount still world think wonderfully immersive also usual lifeskills gathering farming cooking alchemy sailing fishing hunting trading bartering gaming economy really thing game since max min price thing managed developer also player trading expect like eve archeage respect bdo also pretty good housing system lot choice house location convenience roleplay simple look reason lot choice come furniture item also large inital cost lack housing loss said house house break game everything left return almost cash shop furniture crafted free amazing action combat first rate think mmos played tera better combat bdo mob grinding better though well since grinding mob huge part game decider whether like game nothing like putting music killing thousand critter game dungeon like mmos 3 part dungeon visually lovely think mechanically clunky reliance use guide problem played wow final fantasy destiny 2 find raid disappointing comparison bdo never known story still newest story content fully voiced quite good however unfortunately earliest story tutorial real slog also quality life game roof every option think turning stuff adjusting ui search bar item npc item proper description auto path npc need go right click autopathing pleasure knowledge system great contributes entire account alt access almost everything account storage mount pet one big family convenient gearing actually way easier started playing 2017 season server almost obscene much easier benefit new old player alike good change upgrading gear system pretty complicated much complained season server really act great tutorial work prefer avoid grind buy want marketplace cosmetic best detailed mmo however best cashshop aware bother game cheap buy often free try subscription requirement think big deal also one get loyalty system giveaway patient dye system extremely good many slot achieve specific look one main reason nice optional subscription value pack going play value pack definitely worth lot convenience however game required subscription login whenever feel like character creation still one best mmo even modern game kinda crazy completely change character face hair get sick provided value pack bdo probably best complete open world seamless mmo market new world look better graphically area map look like fit together naturally like would real life city actually modelled real city one thing like distinct style well try everything horse primary mount little fast travel mount actually useful true flying mount either gliding amount crazy mmo stuff outrageous either crazy mount flying car robot giraffe monstrosity ridiculous outfit like final fantasy tera usual mmo suspect battle lingerie main culprit opposed bdo one game either love hate bit waiting new mmo never arrives

Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works.

270880,American Truck Simulator,"Wonderful game. 

I can tell you about the difference between it and ETS2. Each game has it's own charm. 

-ATS is newer. Better graphics. 
-ETS2 has more trucks. Way more and slightly more upgrades. ATS only has like 4. 2 brands and 2 types of truck for each.
-ETS2 has a much bigger world. ATS is still young so getting max Distance perk cannot even be applied as you only go between 3 states. ETS2 is full Europe now. Including GB where you should remember to drive on the left side of the road. ;)
-ATS is smaller because it actually has all the world realistically planned. Roads barely ever repeat. In ETS2 you can think ""hey, I've been here before. Or not?"" or ""one more clover highway spread... sigh..."" while in ATS it's always something new wherever you go. And you feel the warmth when you come back to familiar places. 
-ATS has long straight highways, relaxing and enjoyable. Not too boring, not too extreme. ETS2 has very sharp and plentiful turns. Whatever you prefer. Personally I love ATS. You still get enough turning off the highway, in the city or on narrow roads. 
-ATS has amazing scenery here and there. Makes you wanna go everywhere. ETS2 is repetitive. The price for being that huge. 
-ATS has view zoom!!! =D To look out for police. =P
-ATS has very strict speed limits. I think it can be turned off but... Do I really want to do that? I left it on. Speed limits are actually pretty sane. You may crash if you break it. ATS fines for speed violation are much higher. And you're watched by police mostly, less often by cameras. So you a) have to look around to see if there's police nearby, b) you have to watch your speed and current limit, c) you can decide if you want to keep your money or pay a lot for a questionable right to break the laws. Wanna be a rebel? Go ahead. =D  Overall it adds to the gameplay very well. Surprisingly well. I hated speed limits in ETS2, they were stupid and cheaply fined and meh. 
-ATS offers more options for parking. More exp for difficult position, less for fast simple one, none for just ditching the trailer at arrival. Small bit but also adds to the game score.
-ATS has slightly better traffic AI. In general it's just refined and polished more.

So ATS has a great potential and can one day beat ETS2 in all aspects. For now I can enjoy both, depending on my mood. But, I must admit, I love ATS more. It's an upgrade, after all. ^__^

Well.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!

Honestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD

Multiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.

Honest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!

Recommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one.

1336490,Against the Storm,"The game solves one of the 2 biggest problems city builder style games have. 

The first is solving the puzzle and finding something that is more effective than any other strategy and then just spamming that every game. Forcing you to pick bonuses and buildings from limited pools makes different strategies viable every time.

Second is that by having a defined endgame in about an hour for each game you remove a lot of bloat that can come from bigger games. I for one almost never finish a game of Civilization because the fun part was the first few hours. In this game you either win or lose in under an hour and then you are on to the next game.

It's tactically interesting, fun and super addictive. Highly recommend.

> Mountain colony in the arctic circle. It's cold up here so there are few raiders. Colony is too small for robots to care either, so not much combat going on.
> Conditions are cramped, but homey. Build a posh rec room with a piano and a pool table.

> One day, A couple of snow hares wander in. They instantly self-tame and join the colony. About to slaughter them for meat, but my IRL girlfriend, looking over my shoulder, stops me. 

>>Oh my god TehFishey! 
>>Look at the cute bunbuns! THEY'RE ADORABLE!

> Understanding my new assignment, I kick off a large-scale restructuring of my colony's ideology.
> Snow Hares are now sacred animals. They are to be protected at all costs, fed gourmet meals, and given free reign over the entire colony.
> The two Snow Hares are dubbed BunBun the Great and FluffBun the Wise. They quickly have a litter of 3 more, named NewBun, LeedlBun, and SmolBun. Make sure that they are sterilized after that - gods should not need to share in their wealth.

> Life with the Buns is happy, and the colony is prospering. Become a big exporter of drugs. Spend income on weapons and gold for expanding the BunBun temple room.

> Everything changed when the pirates attacked.

> The colony's new wealth attracts a massive sapper raid, dropping in at all corners of the map, holding assault rifles, rocket launchers...
> Massive battle in the courtyard. Many attackers die to booby trapped approaches. Firefights scattered all over. 
> One guy shoots off a doomsday rocket that obliterates two of the colony's founders. Everything's on fire. Colonists snipe the other rocket-toting raiders quickly. Medics try to get to injured people before they bleed out.

> Meanwhile, another sapper team breaks into the colony through a back wall. They decide to throw grenades into the barn pens. Surviving chickens and cows run everywhere. Demented pyromaniac octogenarian colonist goes crazy and lights even more stuff on fire.
> Finally, the battle outside is won. Raiders decide to take what they can and run. One grabs the solid marble pool table and starts sprinting. Another nabs for the TV. A third goes for the piano, but suddenly stops.

> SmolBun, care free, had wandered into the room that the raiders were looting. The third raider takes his machine pistol and shoots. SmolBun dies instantly.
> That raider was named Tucker Franzen. He had murdered SmolBun, still a baby, in cold blood... for the crime of being curious about the new friends who had entered her home.

...

> Entire defense force drops everything and makes a bee line for that fucker Tucker Franzen. Colonists are left to bleed out. Enemies are left to flee. They do not catch Tucker Franzen, but they DO nab his unfortunate friend, Pugsly Rego, still carrying the pool table. 
> The colony's ideology is reformed once more. Sadism becomes trendy. Harvesting organs from prisoners is now celebrated. Killing prisoners is now a spectator sport. Raiding other settlements is encouraged.
> After about 3 days of restitution, what's left of Pugsly Rego crawls out of the colony, naked and ""free"", into a -60c snowstorm. He does not get far.

...

> What follows is a brutal, years-long war of annihilation waged against the pirates that had attacked that day. Eventually, war is declared on the rest of the planet as well. BunBun's gourmet meals are now made with the flesh of his enemies (alongside carrots and eggplant).
> Through serendipitous luck, colonial purification squads eventually find Tucker Franzen on the far side of the planet. Perhaps he was hiding. Great pains are taken to ensure that he is brought back alive.
> Look up some more mods to install. (Rimworld's community has mods for every occasion.) Settle on ""War Crimes Expanded 2"" and ""Bondage Bed Torture"".

...

> Since that first fateful day, the colony had changed. New constructions are everywhere: slave work camps, layers of automated security systems, ammunition storage depots, drop pod launch sites...
> Most impressive, though, is a small, solid gold building near the center of town. Inside is a single golden sarcophagus, wherein rests SmolBun, never to grow big.
> Directly behind the tomb is a dark brick building -- the new home of a VERY unhappy man named Tucker Franzen. Equipped with an eternal youth implant and many other fascinating devices, he would remain unhappy for a very, very long time to come.

EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said ""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO."".

The Paradox support person went on to state: ""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor ""trollish comments"" one you got for that!"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).

My comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point.
------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE:
I love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL/XXL/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.

When I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.

When CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on ""the list"". ""The list"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.

And then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).

The day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.

But it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.

Then the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.

Anyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are:
1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums.
2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants and giving it for free now.
3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.

It was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.

So at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.

I will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.

To everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"Dont let the mixed overall reviews scare you, the game is very enjoyable in its current state. With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixed, it can only go upwards from here. Also, new content is added every few weeks together with events.

Overall the game is a step up from the Monster Hunter series in both graphical terms and gameplay wise.

<Comparison to previous MH titles>

- Gathering is much easier and faster
- More ways to use the environment to your advantage (dropping boulders, sliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)
- A slinger which is used primarily for shooting flash bombs, sonic bombs, etc, but can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)
- Turf wars between monsters, which can turn the hunt to your favor
- Scoutflies which lead you towards points of interest or monster traces (basically they work like a gps)
- Usage of armor skills got way easier, you shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MH
- Customizable cat companion, with plenty of gadgets to help you out
- Damage indicators which let you know if you are attacking a weak spot or just arent doing any damage at all
- No G-rank, this is the only downside really

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"I'm gonna try to be genuinely honest here. The situation for the game is pretty nuanced, and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and/or the worst/best thing to ever happen. In short: you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun, but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so.

Pros: The game is a lot of fun at this stage, and I am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want.

1. What is here now is definitely enough to call this a ""full release.""

2. You can do a LOT, and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game. It's less finicky, while also more powerful, so it's a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool-looking cities. Can't overstate how much of an evolution this is. Examples: road tool is insane, zoning (and the way assets are categorized) gives you much more control, as well as more types of zoning.

3. Performance issues aside, the game is an insane visual upgrade. The game can look frankly shockingly impressive. This ties into the first point to make cities better-looking by default. In the first, you'd need several mods to start making cool cities. Not here. 

4. The simulation is really hecking cool. There are some bugs, but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions - all of a sudden, you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff. Cool! So, it needs a little bit of work, but it's absolutely mostly there.

5. Since everything is simulated, traffic is a lot better. Mostly, you're fine, and at rush hour you get some backup. That's pretty much it now.


Cons: there are pretty good arguments it could have been a) delayed for like 6 months or b) released as an Early Access product.

1. Quite a lot of small bugs. Whether it's education being unbalanced, commercial having weird import/export stuff, or garbage being handled oddly, there's stuff in the simulation that isn't working as intended, or is in need of further balancing. Most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice, or not having enough time to fix it. I guess it's annoying if you sit and think about it, but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way.

2. Performance is bad, but Colossal Order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released. Some of the reporting on it post-release, however, makes it seem like they just didn't have enough time to finish all the work. For instance, the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered, the acknowledge (more-or-less) by Colossal Order about LOD work simply not being finished, or the broken effects (you pretty much need to turn some of them off.) You can ABSOLUTELY run the game - just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off. 

3. Compared to a very kitted up Cities Skylines 1, with all DLC and mods, you might feel a little restricted. If you've played it a lot you'll come across situations where you go ""what a great spot this would be for a custom park,"" or whatever feature from the first game's 10-year life cycle. If you've never played that version of the first game, you might come across situations where you're like ""so I just build more of mostly the same type of district?"" And...both yes and no. There is some challenge to be creative, but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what IS here. Your mileage may vary.

4. Bluntly, some things just make it seem like the game is like 3/4 finished. Why are there no unlocks past the half-way point of the development roadmap (small city-big city etc)? Room for future expansions, or planned but cut features? Who knows. Don't get me wrong, these are non-essential things, but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game.

Taken as it is, you could argue they should've delayed 6 months or released into Early Access instead. But you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a) making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b) giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game. Is it a little cynical? Maybe. Did they coldly calculate that the short-term reputation loss would be offset by the longer-term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself? Also maybe, but don't they have a right to do that, and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do? Looking at it coolly, it is a complicated situation for a company, and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons. I won't presume I'd know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players, employees, publisher, and the company itself.

Furthermore, you could argue that the Early Access label brings with it certain connotations - a never-ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer ""almost finished"" and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality. Also, is it maybe not allowed to release something as Early Access, when it's already been marketed as a ""full release"" sort of thing? Heck if I know - I'm not a lawyer!

To sum it up: Issues notwithstanding, I'm super glad I'm playing the game now rather than in 6 months. I'm glad I get to play it in a state where I can expect what is there to be enough for a release, and don't have to think about what's a month or two down the line. As for the rest of it, I might feel a way about it, but ultimately I'll leave up to Colossal Order because it's their product in the end.",gon na try genuinely honest situation game pretty nuanced difficult express time everything need meme worst best thing ever happen short buy game right heck lot fun game might gotten better initial reception delayed another 6 month pro game lot fun stage happy already get play whenever want 1 definitely enough call full release 2 lot much better tool gate compared first game le finicky also powerful heck lot easier reach higher baseline cool looking city overstate much evolution example road tool insane zoning way asset categorized give much control well type zoning 3 performance issue aside game insane visual upgrade game look frankly shockingly impressive tie first point make city better looking default first need several mod start making cool city 4 simulation really hecking cool bug general way city work individually simulated agent make city sort life independent decision sudden might notice lot people educated consequently want different place work live bunch option build different stuff cool need little bit work absolutely mostly 5 since everything simulated traffic lot better mostly fine rush hour get backup pretty much con pretty good argument could delayed like 6 month b released early access product 1 quite lot small bug whether education unbalanced commercial weird import export stuff garbage handled oddly stuff simulation working intended need balancing stuff simply played game enough notice enough time fix guess annoying sit think single one bug really bothered meaningful way 2 performance bad colossal order upfront game released reporting post release however make seem like enough time finish work instance report wild amount polygon rendered acknowledge le colossal order lod work simply finished broken effect pretty much need turn absolutely run game check posted performance guide effect turn 3 compared kitted city skyline 1 dlc mod might feel little restricted played lot come across situation go great spot would custom park whatever feature first game 10 year life cycle never played version first game might come across situation like build mostly type district yes challenge creative hand force familiarize tool hand get creativity mileage may vary 4 bluntly thing make seem like game like 3 4 finished unlocks past half way point development roadmap small city big city etc room future expansion planned cut feature know get wrong non essential thing feeling almost 70 hour game taken could argue delayed 6 month released early access instead also argue releasing ultimately make game much better much faster making developer accountable player rather arbitrary release date b giving feedback could ever need improve game little cynical maybe coldly calculate short term reputation loss would offset longer term improvement bottom line look like fiscal quarter well game also maybe right need maximally dramatic decide looking coolly complicated situation company either way would gone would pro con presume know perfectly well would right thing player employee publisher company furthermore could argue early access label brings certain connotation never ending cycle waiting game longer almost finished developer abuse concept avoid accountability expectation quality also maybe allowed release something early access already marketed full release sort thing heck know lawyer sum issue notwithstanding super glad playing game rather 6 month glad get play state expect enough release think month two line rest might feel way ultimately leave colossal order product end
1063730,New World,"In the beginning I was really enjoying the game. I could explore the wilds, collect my resources and craft my skills to mastery. The resource burn-down as you advanced in skills was very rough but I was able to mine enough resources in a couple hours of play to serve my needs. Then the bots came.

As a crafter & miner, i was constantly competing against dozens of bots to collect any resource to master my own skills or make an income. Botting services are even available on the net. The really dumb thing is that with crate looting which often included important crafter resources, the crates would vanish for you when you looted them but would still be available for the next person, it was relootable by others thus no competition for the resource but when it came to mining nodes, when a bot mined it, it was gone for everyone, no one else could mine it until it respawned and bots would be constantly patrolling it. It got so blatant that there where bots camping nodes while other bots would go running by naked, patrolling groups of nodes.

Put simply, they lost control of the game to the bots. Real miners can't mine, crafters can't afford to craft because they have to buy their resources or mine what very little they can mine out from under the bots which doesn't even touch the gross amounts of materials you need to make the simplest things or the material burndown.

216150,MapleStory,"Just don't.
I know you're a veteran, but the game you once loved is gone.

Enjoy a dying buggy game with unbelievable server issues, plagued by a skeleton crew of a company operating on the soul purpose of exploiting you for your nostalgia.

You wanna progress?  Fork over thousands of dollars, or spend literal years to try and catch up to people still doing years old content because they don't add any catch up mechanics outside of trashy events that are usually just copy paste of the same shit with a slightly different flavor.

The literal only reason there are still players is because of sunk cost fallacy and addiction.

IF you don't want to fort over the thousands of dollars to even begin the game on regular servers, you can choose to play on reboot and deal with the most annoying RNG filled trash systems without any ability to trade, so you're forced to grind for years to hit what some people would consider to be late game.  It's a mobile game on steroids.

I have a thousand hours on steam, but probably 4x that on the Nexon launcher over the years.  I'm still not even in the late game.  Hell, I'd say I'm closer to being in the mid game still.  No thanks.

I just got word from my old guild discord that they have the audacity to charge $100.00 (ONE HUNDRED) dollars for an in game pet, then on top of the $100.00 charge, they have the audacity to charge $15.00 MONTHLY just to use the thing.  
""But why would anybody pay so much money for a pet?  That's insane.""
Because this pet vacuums up all the items and money on the floor, increasing your efficiency.  So if you want to have any chance of keeping up with the whales you gotta fork over the cash on both your main, and most likely you will want a Kanna alt so you gotta fork it up on that character too.

I do not recommend this game.  I wouldn't even consider this a game, it's just a glorified gambling simulator, where you don't just gamble with your wallet, you do it with your time on top of that.",know veteran game loved gone enjoy dying buggy game unbelievable server issue plagued skeleton crew company operating soul purpose exploiting nostalgia wan na progress fork thousand dollar spend literal year try catch people still year old content add catch mechanic outside trashy event usually copy paste shit slightly different flavor literal reason still player sunk cost fallacy addiction want fort thousand dollar even begin game regular server choose play reboot deal annoying rng filled trash system without ability trade forced grind year hit people would consider late game mobile game steroid thousand hour steam probably 4x nexon launcher year still even late game hell say closer mid game still thanks got word old guild discord audacity charge 100 00 one hundred dollar game pet top 100 00 charge audacity charge 15 00 monthly use thing would anybody pay much money pet insane pet vacuum item money floor increasing efficiency want chance keeping whale got ta fork cash main likely want kanna alt got ta fork character recommend game even consider game glorified gambling simulator gamble wallet time top

1085660,Destiny 2,"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.

SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:

- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)
- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? 
- The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.
- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.
- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. 
- Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?
- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!
- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.


I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. 

I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.

I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game.

686810,Hell Let Loose,"I have nearly 4,000 hours in this game. Team17 recently bought this game and is wholly incompetent with updating this game. There are 6 major issues.

1) Recent updates didn't fix any major outstanding bugs, and instead added new ones like a double reload animation on bolt rifles, XP not being awarded for duplicate actions, and several others. 

2)They released the British faction with historically inauthentic British uniforms, incorrect dates on loading screens, and incorrectly themed weapons like naval SMG's for infantry units and ww1 bolt rifles / machine gun during a ww2 themed game.

3) Not only was this faction historically inaccurate, but it was unbalanced in the negative. Their guns sway more than existing guns, their guns take up more screen space than existing guns (making it harder to see targets), their weapon spread across classes leaves them outgunned by the Germans, Russians, and Americans. The heavy tank for the British faction is using pre-armor overhaul driving mechanics and it's front armor isn't working properly. In short, the faction is trash. 

4) Most controversially, they increased the run speed for all infantry by 15% which allows infantry to effectively chase down heavy tanks and zigzag across open fields effectively. This change was not asked for and it has ripple effects through the game - Negatively impacting armor, small unit tactics, medic's usefulness, etc. The best part - Black Matter (the previous developers) used to have this 15% increase and in Update 8 they outlined EXACTLY WHY they lowered the run speed in the first place (it was for game balance, pacing, and to prevent zig zagging). Team17 didn't do any homework into the history of the previous developers and why game design decisions were made and instead decided to make a muck of the meta just because. 

5) Team17 also decided to add a new game mode which only can contain 50 players total instead of the 100 players total of every currently existing server. Which means people hosting servers will have to purchase an entire new server simply to host this new game mode. Never mind that the new game mode is antithetical to the premise of hell let loose in the first place and wasn't really asked for by serious players of Hell Let Loose.

6) The icing on the cake was the Devotion to Duty trailer which was so embarrassingly bad they had to take down from their official Youtube account and publicly apologize for. It still exists by PC Gamer channel if you want to look at the pure mediocrity.

There is always an event going on and combined with the folklore, culture and mythology of Appalachia this creates for a very engaging and unique experience.

You can play in first or third person and solo or in teams of up to four persons. It’s very easy to join random teams and doing so provides more benefits even if you never play together. For world events you don’t even need to join a group, just so long as you’re in the area you will get credit for completion.

There is a lot of flexibility in character choices. Beginning is limited but it doesn’t take long to start collecting enough levels to unlock perks cards and skill points. Perks can be changed on the fly (literally mid-battle if needed) and don’t worry about spending skill points either because they can be changed at a dedicated machine infinitely. 

The most prestigious loot is randomised and can have between one to three extra traits. ‘Legendary’ items can’t be scrapped like ordinary items but can be traded in for currency specifically related to rerolling traits and purchasing more legendary weapons.

There is a moderately deep crafting system which mostly revolves around the collection junk, just enough balance that you might have to consciously collect specific items but not so much it’s a tedious bore. Coincidentally if you die you will only lose items classified as junk. 

[b]Performance and Bugs[/b]
My FPS continues to be all over the place, I have never been able to get a stable 60 FPS. I don’t crash every session I play but it happened enough that I prepare for it now - especially after playing solo one session I crashed shortly after dying, losing all my collected junk.

Servers will occasionally freeze up and NPCs will be stuck in place without attacking, even after their death they’re playing a gory version of musical statues.

Enemy AI often seems borked, easily tricked by stealth even when you don’t have any stealth perks equipped. Stairs will confuse them and if you’re able to jump up to a high spot you can take your sweet time chipping away high enemy health.

[b]Community[/b]
The first few hours playing I met some of the friendliest people I have ever met in a video game. They were literally bending over backwards to be nice, giving out weapons and other useful items. They also loved showing off their houses and I’m always a sucker for wanting to see a person's creativity within games. Most people keep to themselves outside of small interactions but the in-game emotes are so warm and expressive you can almost have entire conversations only using them.

Servers are split into PVE or PVP with a maximum of 24 persons at any time. Custom/Private servers are locked behind the ‘Fallout 1st’ subscription. There are a few ‘trolls’ trying to PVP on PVE servers but they can’t really do anything unless they are actively engaged with - just make sure to store your junk before doing anything stupid.

[b]Trade[/b]
Economy is busted. Given that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic game, you would have thought food, materials and tech resources would be immensely valuable but nope - worthless. Everything is so plentiful and constantly respawning. Server hopping is a valid strategy for the few items that you can’t find easily. The most valuable things appear to be plans from previous events and seasons and occasionally weapons/armour with very specific traits. People who own these typically want way more than what a newbie could afford and people who wanted them had already farmed them before they became rare. For everything else, keep looking til you find someone selling them for pennies.

[b]Exploration[/b]
The map ends up feeling REALLY small because of the instantaneous nature of the fast travel. Previous open-world Bethesda titles have similar problems but a lot of quests in F76 have you revisiting locations and this exaggerates this feeling. It’s a bit of a double edge sword, being able to teleport to your friends is a must but you can accidentally skip a lot of content. Exploration without purpose feels underwhelming, the landmarks themselves are amazing but unless you have a quest or a specific reason for being there, you’re unlikely to be rewarded with useful items.  

[b]C.A.M.P and Monetization[/b]
Honestly, the player housing (C.A.M.P) is one of the best additions to Fallout 76. You can choose almost anywhere in the world to plant your roots and yes, it’s clunky and awkward to build but  there is access to a lot of items to build a decent little hovel without additional purchases using real money. I love my little pancake house.

Atoms are the real money currency. They are used to buy (mostly) cosmetic items from the Atomic Shop. You can earn a decent amount just doing in-game challenges and progressing through the season pass. I've managed to earn about 5,000 so far. To purchase them directly would have cost me £31.99. 

Fallout 1st monthly membership includes an additional 1650 Atoms every month at a cost of £11.99 (that’s more than World of Warcraft!!). Personally I think this is not even remotely worth it, you can earn more than enough cosmetic items through the free season pass. The biggest appeal to actually purchasing it, after speaking to others, comes from the infinite junk storage but it really shouldn’t be. It feels like the antithesis of hoarding habits many who play open-world games end up adopting and the cynic in me says they’re artificially creating problems and solving it with money.

[b]Modding[/b]
I was gobsmacked to discover that some mods work with public servers. My experience is second hand from a friend as I never downloaded any but amongst the mods they had included: improved load times and performance; a text based chat system that worked cross-server; visual notifications for nearby items (such as bobbleheads/magazines/recipes/etc).

[b]Achievements and Endgame[/b]
Completionists be aware there are two reputation grinds, one achievement that will require a second playthrough and then.… ‘Troglodiced’ (Kill 100 Trogs with an Auto Axe).
Trogs are an enemy only found in the end game raid-like instances called ‘expeditions’. The recipe for the auto-axe is sold by only one NPC for 1,000 stamps. Neither the auto-axe, nor the recipe, can be traded with other players. To earn stamps you have to play through expeditions but before you can start an expedition you have to do three specific dailies to ‘charge up a battery’. The first expedition I completed earned me 3 stamps… The most you can earn is 10 stamps per expedition (8 if you are not the group leader). 

Endgame in general is rather lacklustre and grindy. Revolving around doing the same daily quests and daily/weekly challenges working towards completing the season pass. There are big bosses but defeating them rarely feels like an accomplishment. However, I’ve still put over 150 hours into this game (which is nothing compared to some), I do not regret it and will happily still be checking in from time to time.",wrong fallout 76 completely

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","The first two acts are really good and kept me engaged and immersed. I never thought I would enjoy the Warhammer 40k setting. 
However, from act 3, the game starts falling apart in all areas: battle balance, progression, companions, dialogs, choice reactivity, story, colony management, and on top of that, there are lots of bugs.
I don't even want to start on some design decisions, sometimes it feels like the devs hate the player.
Objectively, it deserves a negative review for being so unfinished. 
I'm giving it a positive one just because two good acts are still a lot compared to what other games offer nowadays.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"Just finished my first multiplayer in Dom6. 

Oof. Quite a miss here, it is a mixed bag on release.

The negative
-The additions of content into the game are barelly worth even 20$ all around. A few new nations, really bad sprites, terrible UI, some units are mis-named or without description and their stats are not aligned with the units that they are taken from (example mamoth archers on Caelum)
-Mekone, Phlegra, Ubar, Na'Ba, Vaettiheim had great sprites on release or later on when some of these natiosn were implemented. Cannot say the same for the new nations.
-The game was supposed to be discounted on release, instead it launched as !!!44 euros!!! which is an absurd price.
-Unit formations are not possible with hotkeys anymore?
-Censorship of Pretender names (this is bad no matter the reason, sometimes replaces the Prentender with the previously submitted one and there is no reason to know that this has happened)(This might not be true)
-Visual dissonance all around. Trees, rocks, animated trees etc they all meld together and you no longer have that easy to distinguish feeling when looking at the battlefield.
-Cave biomes create another layer of nations that become hard to touch in their respective domain. Much like underwater.
-Unit sizes on battlefield. Lion warrior with larger is size 5 but his sprite is taller and wider than a Muspelheim basic spear giant (not the sacred ones).
-Niche submechanics are added that do not really add much. Trees? Rocks? It makes the battlefield too noisy, too convoluted, too full of useless stuff.
-All around another choice of unfiting music. This is not debatable, music in Dominions peaked in Dominions 4 and the current selection is even worse than its predecesor.
-God the UI is horrible. Everything is on the top right of the screen, the individual provinces have their own window with a small font of letters to describe it, many things are hard to see and define clearly at a glance.

The positive
+Netcode seems to be ok (bravo to Blitzmin) as using the Illwinter servers is good enough for a full Blitz game (10 minutes per turn) on day 1.
+Still as enjoyable as always and there is extra depth added in some places.
+There is no meta yet. If you have played Mordhau on release you know what to expect. Game is fun and there are no tryhards yet.
+Mounts are cool. 
+New magic and spells. However, illusion magic just doesn't fit a lot of the time.

I recommend a pass for now. Buy later when it is even more ironed out, but kepp it in the back of your head, that this should have been done way before release. The beta testing team did a poor job bringing these qualms out and into Illwinters attention, or, the developers themselves half-assed this release.

I hold my views in no particular regard. I've played on discords and /domg/ alike.

289070,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.
Why? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. 
As such, I can NOT recommend this game. 

To verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. 
Then I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).
Then, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. 
This is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"The developers of the original Modern Warfare 2 (the 2009 one) said that they ran into a problem after that game, because it was fundamentally an incredible game... but nobody knew why. Thus, they couldn't replicate that magic, because they didn't know what caused it in the first place.

I feel that Dying Light 1 create this same problem. In many ways, DL2 is fundamentally superior, with smoother animations, more zombie variety, more fleshed out character upgrades, and a more developed, interesting world. It has it faults as compared to DL1 (no grappling hook and no guns come to mind), but in most respects, it should be the superior game to DL1... but it's not. There's simply a magic about DL1 which they couldn't replicate this time around. DL2 is fleshed out and well made. It's not buggy or un-optimized, and Techland certainly did enough with it to claim it to be its own AAA game. But it's no DL1.

Is DL2 worth buying? Sure. I got my money's worth out of it and don't regret buying it. But don't go in expecting to re-live the magic of DL1.

221100,DayZ,"I have owned DayZ SA since it was announced. I bought it the instant it came up for sale on the steam store. Before that, I played hundreds of hours in the various mods. 

I have nearly 800 hours in DayZ SA and I can honestly say that while I got my fun out of it, most of that was due to the time I spend commiserating with friends when the game didnt work as intended. 

I have defended this game, written reviews about this game for the subreddit, argued with people, gone back and forth between loving and hating it, no faith in the devs and renewed faith.

However, when they announced that the game would be LAUNCHING out of EA at the end of 2018, I was genuinely apprehensive and unsure as to the future of this game. At that moment I knew the devs had lied to us, had lead us on, and ultimately, had no intentions of finishing this game in the way that was promised. 

This is much deeper than simple gameplay design changes. They never discussed with us just how much of an undertaking it all was - for example, vehicles have ALWAYS supposed to be in the game. For the first 2-3 years they were NOT in the game. The game was barebones, and when they finally added vehicles they were broken in the same way some of the mod cars were broken. 

They took 6 years and made ZERO progress in terms of completing this game. I could talk for hours and hours about things promised and the underwhelming deliver of those features. If they came at all. 

The game is FUNDAMENTALLY broken. Base building, broken. Vehicles, broken. Hit detection during firefights, broken. Inventory system is such an obtuse mess its BROKEN. Core features of this game remain in limbo and as you play you'll find that you're jimmy rigging and finding loopholes to combat the broken features just to get them to semi-work in your favor. 

And then they go and release this DLC. Its fucking disgusting. BI should be FUCKING ASHAMED of themselves. This is EA level shadiness and greediness. 

It breaks my heart to say that I absolutely cannot recommend this game to anyone I know. I will soon be uninstalling as its been a solid 6 months since I've tried playing. Sad.

edit: for all you jackasses pointing out that I have 500 more hours than I did when I made the review, did you read to comprehend what I said, or just skim past and find all the bits that made u mad? 

Because I was pretty clear. I cannot recommend this game to anyone - I still stand by that. I cannot. Right around the time I wrote this, the modding scene for SA was just starting to really take off. About 6 months after that and its now thriving - mods make this game playable.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"This is going to be a fairly lengthy review, focusing mainly on the negative points as I believe focusing on the negatives more than the positives helps better inform a potential buyer.

First, the good things:

1. The game is beautiful, one can clearly see that a lot of effort has been put into creating a stunning map with a lot of features. It really does feel like a medieval countryside.

2. The amount of buildings, items, cities and general types of content is good. There is a lot to do in this game.

Buuuut (brace yourselves):

1. The speed of progress is astoundingly slow. Building stuff takes ages, collecting takes ages. You have hundreds of meat and cabbage in storage and want to automate food production in the kitchen? Too bad, the villager that you've assigned to cook stew only makes 4-5 per day. You want to automate tool creation so you don't spend your time making axes for your lumberjacks and knifes for your hunters? Too bad, the smithy takes 3 days to make a single axe. Furthermore, technology points are earned veeeeeeery slowly. Want to build a mine? That's 4000 (or 5000, I don't remember)points to unlock. After 40 hours I'm at slightly under 2000, even though I've build one (or two) of every building and have 15 houses in my village. At this pace I'll probably be able to unlock this in 20-30 hours which is just too much of a grind.

2. Animals, mounts and technology costs are incredibly high. A chicken is 700 gold, even though it barely produces any eggs. A pig is 2000, even though it barely produces any manure. Every time you invest in something it just feels like you're sinking money into an endless pit. Early on I found out that I can make gold by selling stone knifes (2 stone and 10 sticks). This nets me about 3000 gold an hour. 40 hours into the game it still feels like my best source of income.

3. Even though the game is called 'Medieval Dynasty' having children (both you and your villagers) is a major disadvantage. The women stop working for 2 years and a villager can't start working until he's 18 years old. For comparison, after 40 hours of play, I'm at year 4 of my play-trough. People online will give you advice on rotating your villagers to different houses so they don't marry. This is just absurd and goes against the concept of the whole game.

4. Speaking of concepts, it feels like there should be some self-sufficiency of villagers. If a villager is thirsty he won't go to the well that's right in the middle of the village, he expects water to be handed to him. A hunter without a knife would never make a knife for himself, he would just wait around until a knife is provided to him. It feels like you're managing a dysfunctional commune, not a village. I think the game would be infinitely better if all production tools for villagers gave them an efficiency bonus above a certain baseline rather than being a complete necessity.

5. Quests are boring and repetitive. That doesn't seem to sound like a problem until you realise that you need to do them to increase your diplomacy so you can sell your goods at normal prices.

6. While I praised the game's map for being beautiful, you'll probably end up cursing yourself for not building your village as close as possible to an existing one. The limited carrying capacity combined with the distances makes the game more of a walking simulator than a town builder every time you want to buy or sell something in a town. I cannot over-state this - you will be spending a lot of time walking around. Now, maybe getting a mount will speed this up, but I'm yet to get one.

7. With the small carrying capacity (even with backpacks and such) building is a chore. You end up making endless runs to your resource storage for more logs, more sticks, more straw. It never ends.

8. While seasonality of crops and herbs is very cool as an idea and brings a lot of flavour and immersion it's not implemented well when it comes to harvesting and gathering. For example, you cannot set a field to be planted with wheat in Autumn and then with cabbage in spring. You have to manually change the types of plant every season, which is annoying. The herbalist hut acts the same - you cannot select which herbs you want gathered for each season when allocating work percentages.

In conclusion, I simply cannot recommend this game. Yes, it's fun for a while and it's not expensive, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. It's a 30-40 hour experience stretched to a possible 100+ hours of grind with no meaningful progression. In my play-trough I would have probably progressed in tech more if I didn't even bother with recruiting villagers and catering to their needs, which defeats the purpose of the entire game. I'm told that you can change the carrying capacity, the speed of levelling, the amount of stamina used and other parameters at the start of your game. That probably would help. But what kind of game requires ""cheats"" and fiddling with parameters to be good?

1336490,Against the Storm,"Against the Storm is another one of those great Early Access games that feels essentially complete already, I don't even really know how close to the finish line it is, but the foundation is solid, the core gameplay loop is fun, the presentation is top tier. Which is all to say, even in early access, I recommend this heartily to fans of the genre and maybe any intrigued outsiders as well.

Against the Storm is a city builder and a roguelike, which might seem like a poor match, but it actually works very well. The theme of the game seems to be impermanence. You're building towns in a forest as satellites for a central city ruled by an impatient queen. You start a town, and try to build it up to a certain reputation level through various means, either keeping your townfolk happy (and you get lots of different species of town folk, up to three per town, who all have different needs, wants and skills), completing requests from the queen that come every so often, or by exploring the glades of the forest for goodies you can send back to the central city.

The actual process of building up the town using mechanics more often seen in roguelikes is interesting as well. You'll be given access to more and more buildings as you progress, but importantly, never the complete set, so you need to plan ahead, decide what you need for the challenges likely to be present using the resources available in a given biome, of which there are many. There are also perk-like ""cornerstones"" you get for reaching new years in the town (you can also trade for more), that give you bonuses that can stack synergistically with each other, and the other factors present in your town, in a way that feels like how you'd establish a ""build"" in any other roguelike. It's clever.

Once you've completed a town (or reached a fail state when the queen loses patience, represented by a bar that is always slowly ticking upwards), you move on to the next town, choosing a new location in an overworld and starting from scratch. After you've been through a handful of towns, the delightfully named Blightstorm arrives and destroys them all, wiping the overworld slate clean and randomising it once more. Impermanence.

There is a meta layer of upgrades to look forward to though, unlocked by resources gathered by completing towns in certain biomes or with certain conditionals spread across the overworld, so not everything gets wiped away.

This has been a dry sort of review so far, but it's a hard game to explain, it's definitely a game that's more than the sum of its parts, and even those individual parts are pretty decent, so the whole is something special. Everything comes together so cleanly, with care and polish, good music and cute graphics, and a chill atmosphere that makes it very pleasant to play.",storm another one great early access game feel essentially complete already even really know close finish line foundation solid core gameplay loop fun presentation top tier say even early access recommend heartily fan genre maybe intrigued outsider well storm city builder roguelike might seem like poor match actually work well theme game seems impermanence building town forest satellite central city ruled impatient queen start town try build certain reputation level various mean either keeping townfolk happy get lot different specie town folk three per town different need want skill completing request queen come every often exploring glade forest goody send back central city actual process building town using mechanic often seen roguelikes interesting well given access building progress importantly never complete set need plan ahead decide need challenge likely present using resource available given biome many also perk like cornerstone get reaching new year town also trade give bonus stack synergistically factor present town way feel like establish build roguelike clever completed town reached fail state queen loses patience represented bar always slowly ticking upwards move next town choosing new location overworld starting scratch handful town delightfully named blightstorm arrives destroys wiping overworld slate clean randomising impermanence meta layer upgrade look forward though unlocked resource gathered completing town certain biome certain conditionals spread across overworld everything get wiped away dry sort review far hard game explain definitely game sum part even individual part pretty decent whole something special everything come together cleanly care polish good music cute graphic chill atmosphere make pleasant play
703080,Planet Zoo,"As someone who grew up with the original Zoo Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon 2, I was kind of losing hope for a spiritual successor of the franchise being given the crap fest that is the new Zoo Tycoon. I have also always been a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon games, so naturally I played Planet Coaster as well, which gave me high expectations for Planet Zoo. And for the most part those expectations have actually been met. The animals have unique needs, and they're nice to look at. Building exhibits is easier and more fun than in ZT and ZT2. Construction is just like Planet Coaster's, it gives you a lot of room for creativity. The campaign is good too and teaches features incrementally at an easy pace, and I'm looking forward to more scenarios. Franchise mode seems laggy somethings though, such as when opening the animal trading. It can also be a little frustrating to filter and navigate on the trading. I would like if there was a search bar and a clear all filters button at least. They've been pretty good so far with the patches that have been released, so hopefully improvements will keep being made.

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"UPD from January 13th. Apparently some people still look at this review and get upset by the fact that I played this game for 70 more hours after posting the review. So, let me clarify.
I came back to the game at some point in December to check out their latest bugfixes in combination with the unofficial mods. I've started a new city and built it up to about 30k population in those 70 hours. Unfortunately, while some things got improved, overall I still found the experience too frustrating in many areas. So I've put it on the shelf again. I will probably come back to give another go at some later time ago, when more bugfixes and mods roll out.

With 108 hours in, and with a heavy heart, I am putting this game on the virtual shelf.
I was waiting for the release more than I'd waited for any game in the last 10 years. CS1 (along with CIV6) was my main hobby for a decade (800 and 1000 hours spent on them respectively). 
I have even invested in a new PC exclusively for CS2 (RTX 4070, Ryzen 7 5800X, 32GB RAM). 
So I'm sure I should be counted among the ""hardcore fans"" of CS franchise. 
With all that said, I just can't play it in its current state. Here's a few reasons as to why, listed in order of priority, highest to lowest:
 - a lot of minor issues/bugs: none of them game breaking but combined, they result in a rather frustrating gaming experience
 - some game mechanics are either not working properly or at least not transparent enough to make for good gameplay (top example is income - I went up to 300mil on my city while being in the negative most of the time; the tax income also fluctuates widely, as do government subsidies)
 - very limited assets: of course, a lot more than vanilla CS1 had, but a LOT less than what I'm used to now in CS1 with all the steam workshop stuff and DLCs 
 - no mods: I'm also far too used to the amazing mods available in CS1 which enrich the experience sooo much... and while CS2 indeed covers some of those mods in vanilla, most of them are missing and playing without them just doesn't feel right

Sooo... what's next? I will wait for the paradox workshop to go online and get filled up with a healthy supply of mods and assets. By that time hopefully most of the issues will be addressed as well, and maybe one or two DLCs will be out. Then I'll give it another go. 
And my recommendation to anyone contemplating a purchase: just wait for all of the above things first. That's what I would tell myself if I could time travel a month ago.

960090,Bloons TD 6,"→ Bloons TD 6 is set in a near-orwellian dystopian future where humanity's evolution has taken an alternate path; Evolving us into hyper-intelligent monkeys running a banana-fueled economy, which has been propped up precariously with a monkey housing-market shadow-banking scheme (but with banana bucks and bloons). Use government sponsored bloon-money (read: blood-money) to hire genetically engineered super-monkeys, psychopathic mercenary soldiers, surgically-enhanced unfeeling cyborgs, feed live sacrifices to the monkey Sun God, and to generally create horrendous weapons of mass poppage that will help you on your monkey business preventing the EXTREMIST Bloon terrorists from passing through and INFLATING the monkey economy, POPPING the housing-market bubble your monkey government has entrusted you, Big Brother, to protect. Do your duty and prevent BILLIONS of innocent monkeys from spiralling into homelessness and poverty by keeping bloon-kind chained where they belong, floating the economy and holding up Big Banana Goverment.

== The gameplay ==
→ BTD6 is a highly addicting tower defense game with amusing and diverse paths to create the mystifyingly satisfying noise that is balloons popping. (If you like the sound made by messing with bubble wrap, you've just found your gamer crack.) You start off placing your typically cheap monkeys-for-hire on the track, and gain progressive account-bound experience that unlocks tower upgrades and points for a monkey talent-tree that keeps you coming back for another go, while also keeping you from being overwhelmed by the insane mass of tower options and build paths you eventually have straight from the beginning. By the end of it you'll be plopping down mortars that can focus fire anywhere on the screen, helicopters that follow your cursor (or the enemy bloons if you're lazy), druids who spam chain lightning, and even necromancers who resurrect zombie bloons that move backwards on the track, popping their former brethren. 

== On the pay-to-win issue ==
→ Even if you're a player like me who typically hates grinding for unlocks, the gameplay is so satisfying I felt like I was making typical progress in a monkey RTS / RPG rather than being slogged down and penalized for not making in-game purchases. The pay-to-win isn't much of an issue in multiplayer either (it just means an easy co-op win).
→ If you're having trouble with the progression I recommend spiking your upgrade unlock rate without spending real money in a couple of ways: 
(A) Git gud and out-scale the bloon waves past the end wave into freeplay mode for BIG wads of player XP
(B) Run a few maps blazing-fast over-and-over again for wave-based XP that goes towards towers present on the screen.
(C) Getting lots of free the micro-transaction currency from first time map wins and challenges (hint: there is sometimes big bonus currency for winning a randomly selected map on each difficulty tier even after you've 100%'d, bigger on higher difficulty, and quests given on the home screen for even more). 
(D) use free OP towers you get from near-constant in-game events and map victories for play-to-win ez mode on challenges and maps you're too lazy to tryhard on, or 
(E) get carried by the bored 1000-hour randos in easy/intermediate queue who've ended up with WAAAY too much free micro-transaction currency and map-victory towers in co-op queue.

== Some things of note + tips ==
1) In co-op mode, the dev has made a brilliant design decision to prevent actual text typing and you instead communicate through a monkey-see monkey-do style emote menu. Communicate like its monkey Dark Souls.
2) There is a massive, extremely NOT-casual difficulty spike as you go upwards towards expert maps. Get together with the bros for co-op and rip out your hair together while having tons of headache-inducing fun in voice chat on Discord, scheming how the hell you're supposed to win without backing onto your play-to-win towers that are straight-out disabled on certain challenges.
3) I've seen this game on sale for $0.99 at least twice so far at the time of this writing, pop it on your wishlist and you might catch it that way again.
4) By some form of dark magic, this game has an active Youtube community with lots of gameplay tips, tricks, and mind-exploding big brain tower micro for you to dig up. Give it a search!

230410,Warframe,"Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, [b]1500 hours[/b] on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.

[h1]What is this game even[/h1]
Warframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a ""Warframe"", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.

[h1]Whats the bloody goal of the game[/h1]
Unlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.

[h1]So hows the customization[/h1]
This is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.
You can also change the look of your items for [b]maximum fashion,[/b] even as a new people.

[h1]It's free to play, meaning it has microtransactions...[/h1]
Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: ""Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.."" The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.


[h1]Alright, that's good and all, but what are the cons[/h1]
Even tho i just said the game is ""extremely replayable"", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a [b]bit[/b] beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.

[h1]Ze End[/h1]
So thats my short review of the game. I dont wanna go much more into details since i feel like new players should see it for themself, but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it is, and what you can expect from it. If you like what you hear, then give it a try, its free after all.

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"The quick and dirty recommendation guide (pick as many +/- points as you like and make up your mind if it's worth buying):
+ strong narrative
+ outstanding sound and visual presentation
+ responsive, intense and simple combat
+ nightmarish horror atmosphere (without jump scares)
+ superb voice acting
+ frightening and well-designed end bosses
+/- combat lacks complexity and may be too simple for some
+/- no replay value (it may have for a revisited experience)
+/- bit short, which is compensated by fair price and gameplay without tedious and lengthy grinds
+/- high stylized presentation of events and plot may not be everyone's taste (totally mine, though)
- gameplay doesn't offer much variety
- not much to explore apart from lore stones telling you about Norse mythology (which is quite important, however!)
- lack of variety in enemies and their appearance

The details:

Hellblade tells a story about suffering, sacrifice, darkness and endeavor. Following the story of Picts warrior maid Senua, you embark on a nightmarish and mind-twisting journey to Helheim, to save a beloved one’s soul. However, for Senua, many things aren’t what they’re supposed to be, for she’s suffering from severe psychosis. While you often can’t decide what’s real and what not, you must overcome many obstacles and enemies – the latter seemingly coming right out of Hel(l).

No other game, up to this point, managed to devour me – getting me so immersed – like Hellblade did. This game just pulled me deeper than any other game has accomplished in recent years, and I, mentally, switched off everything else around me and Senua’s reality became mine. The sound design and visual presentation is outstanding.

I was always a fan of non-linear storytelling and Hellblade totally nailed it. Its presentation is intriguing, captivating and keep you ever so interested in what happened (to Senua) and how everything will turn out.

As for the gameplay I was kind of surprised of what they came up with: There's a level where there is nothing but darkness and you have to find your way out, without fighting, only using your senses, as Senua's reaching out with her hand to frisk her surroundings, or running from one light source to another to not getting devoured by darkness. In other parts, cynically spoken, you could call it 'walking simulator', but, as for myself, I was so immersed in the world that I didn't mind. It doesn’t deliver any boredom even when ‘nothing’ happens.

There is one thing to explore off the main paths, however: Lore stones. These stones – telling you about Norse mythology in appearance of an old friend – are optional but critical in further expanding on the whole game’s story. At first one might not see the entangled meaning of Norse mythology and it seems rather random, just to give this game a Norse touch although you're not playing a viking heroine. Certainly, Vikings are involved in the story but that doesn’t necessarily explain why you keep hearing stories about the Northmen. But keep your wits about you and you’ll come to realize the importance of those stories.

I also enjoyed the combat, although it lacks complexity and deep mechanics. So, what is to like about it? Its responsiveness and simplicity made it a blast to play. It is quick, brutal, intense and it just works without any clumsiness. In that regard it is sort of 'flawless', straight on point. Don't expect anything near like Dark Souls, though.

Visual clues were used in a clever way and weren't spelled out boldly for you with exclamation marks, compass needles and the like. Even in one given situation where acting under pressure and time limit was required, I managed to find all the necessary clues at the first try without said compass needle or other HUD markers pointing out where to go – there are voices telling you to ""focus"" or to look in another direction. The lack of (almost) any meta information fits the theme of the game and it is an enjoyable change in a video game. That being said, there's no ""meta game"" telling you how to do things (apart from the game options menu). No HUD, no text boxes or pop ups. Everything you need to know to beat the game is offered by the environments and from 'within' the game.

It absolutely has become one of my favorite games by now.",quick dirty recommendation guide pick many point like make mind worth buying strong narrative outstanding sound visual presentation responsive intense simple combat nightmarish horror atmosphere without jump scare superb voice acting frightening well designed end boss combat lack complexity may simple replay value may revisited experience bit short compensated fair price gameplay without tedious lengthy grind high stylized presentation event plot may everyone taste totally mine though gameplay offer much variety much explore apart lore stone telling norse mythology quite important however lack variety enemy appearance detail hellblade tell story suffering sacrifice darkness endeavor following story picts warrior maid senua embark nightmarish mind twisting journey helheim save beloved one soul however senua many thing supposed suffering severe psychosis often decide real must overcome many obstacle enemy latter seemingly coming right hel l game point managed devour getting immersed like hellblade game pulled deeper game accomplished recent year mentally switched everything else around senua reality became mine sound design visual presentation outstanding always fan non linear storytelling hellblade totally nailed presentation intriguing captivating keep ever interested happened senua everything turn gameplay kind surprised came level nothing darkness find way without fighting using sens senua reaching hand frisk surroundings running one light source another getting devoured darkness part cynically spoken could call walking simulator immersed world mind deliver boredom even nothing happens one thing explore main path however lore stone stone telling norse mythology appearance old friend optional critical expanding whole game story first one might see entangled meaning norse mythology seems rather random give game norse touch although playing viking heroine certainly viking involved story necessarily explain keep hearing story northman keep wit come realize importance story also enjoyed combat although lack complexity deep mechanic like responsiveness simplicity made blast play quick brutal intense work without clumsiness regard sort flawless straight point expect anything near like dark soul though visual clue used clever way spelled boldly exclamation mark compass needle like even one given situation acting pressure time limit required managed find necessary clue first try without said compass needle hud marker pointing go voice telling focus look another direction lack almost meta information fit theme game enjoyable change video game said meta game telling thing apart game option menu hud text box pop ups everything need know beat game offered environment within game absolutely become one favorite game
703080,Planet Zoo,"This is my GAME OF THE DECADE. Yes that is right DECADE! I have now done 1336 hours in just over a year. A year and 2 months. Anyway great design. The campaign is great way to learn. But where this game really excels is the workshop. Download someone a blueprint and make it better. Make it yours. Gain ideas. Be inspired. 

The game has received some good free updates including vending machines etc and education talks. And each paid dlc adds a few more animals and ranging between 200 and 350 new items. Some people think 4 to 5 animals is not significant even and I do feel it is a bit on the low side. However where these packs excel is the new items. Seriously in 1 year the community has received 1000 new items  and I am not going to lie. Some of these items I can not live with out for example the new waterfalls in the aquatic pack are a must.

But back to the base game. Fun and educational how many games can claim that. Its not just about putting carnivores separate to herbivores  its about making sure your animals dont inbreed or spread disease. And most importantly happy. Happy animals means more money from guests. 

This is a very rich deep game. I remember being on hour 1000 and I learnt a new mechanic. That was how to lay perfect railway/tram tracks. Previously mine were wonky and looked hideous. Now after mastering this skill My zoo looks perfect.

I never cheated while playing and I wasn't the toxic kind of player. I didn't even had a warning for bad behavior on my account. supported the game a lot, I even had odyssey Archon Thanatos and other T5 skins on my account only to find out that all that time and money invested on this game is gone forever.

I tried to reach out to hirezstudios support about my issue but the only answers I get are from bots saying the same useless stuff that doesn't help my case. I've seen speed-hackers and people send death threats left and right in this game and they are still out there playing the game while I'm banned and never broke TOS. I have learned my lesson and won't support any Hirezstudios products anymore because they obviously don't care about their supportive fans.

From what I remember the game was fun even though most of the times there was super toxic players spamming chat or VGS and matchmaking was not balanced. Also a lot of smurfs in early games and instalockers that ruin the fun and the classic meta slaves who only pick op characters because it's ""meta""

1190970,House Flipper 2,"First, I wish I could give this a neutral review, there are things I like but then things I absolutely hate. So it tips the scale to stand on the do not recommend for the moment. After about 15 hours these are my opinions;

[h2]Positives:[/h2]
● I like the way the game looks, I think the stylized graphics are fine.
● Trash pickup is more involved and feels realistic, which I love.
● Build challenges for different types of item are fun imo, again, it adds to the realism.
● Voice acting is great, I feel more part of the story which is lovely.
● Destruction/Construction is MUCH better, being able to make half walls and such is a HUGE boon. I love it.
● The furniture being able to be colored almost however you'd like was MUCH needed. huge improvements there!

[h2]Negative (there's quite a bit):[/h2]
● Why did we replace the mini-map with this builder sense..? It's abysmal.
● No master quest list. You're expected to waltz through every room mashing your menu to find what you've missed
● No curtains, wall to wall carpets, slanted walls, arched doorways, and a TON of other things left out from HF1. why go backwards? It feels like a prequel comparatively.
● Gardening has been removed completely. now its just ""put an object down"". Feels very sims-like. not a fan
● As mentioned above with just placing objects, no more installing components like heat, plumbing, or electrical. Half of the fun was feeling like you're truly building/renovating a home.
● No workshop? I know the IO is meant to house a lot of that stuff but it seems to be more-so for maps and jobs rather than objects. the community really adds to these games, let them.
● Can't import pictures anymore, that's a true shame considering all the empty frames.
● The before and after wasn't something I realized I would miss. After finishing a job I'm finding myself feeling unsatisfied.
● The percentage of the job completed is necessary. I've had a ""3 star completion"" a few times. but it turns out that may be a HUD bug because it will then give me 2.99 stars because I missed the last pixel of one clean job in a room (shout out to builder's sense) and it rounds it down to 2 stars despite the 3 stars being fully lit. Just add what percentage of the job is finished. It makes sense..
● No mention of HOW to raise price when flipping a house. Potential buyers no longer tell you what they even want? We're left to guess what is good or bad. That's unbelievable. How are you going to slouch on house flipping when that's the NAME of the GAME? for real?


[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
All in all it feels like a general downgrade from HF1. Some things were improved but at the cost of so many good features being canned. It's hard to tell if the devs left these things out because of a change in vision or as a way to squeeze more money out of the community by selling things that should have been in this game though DLC in the future. One would assume the devs would have put all they learned over the lifespan of HF1 into this game to start and sold dlc of things they hadn't thought of, like they did with the first one. You've already learned what the community wants, why leave it out? It makes the overall experience feel like most of the early access games I play. But atleast those are 5-20 dollars. Not 40. 

For the time being i'm going to say it's not worth it and spend my time elsewhere, which is SO unfortunate. I've been keeping up with the discord and updates since it was announced. I was as excited for this as I possibly could have been. I guess I'll wait another year or so and hope the devs update it to add these things, sadly it's in vogue to charge 200 dollars for a complete game by adding necessary features as paid dlc months down the line so i'm expecting that.

899770,Last Epoch,"Last Epoch has the pacing and difficulty of Diablo 2, with learnings from newer games in the genre such as Path of Exile, Diablo 3, Grim Dawn, etc. Their philosophy steers clear of many of the shortcomings of games like Diablo 3 (gear sets bring the primary focus, 500% damage increases dominating everything, 1 build to rule them all, etc.), and emphasizes build diversity and experimentation without overly harsh penalties for trying something new.

Skill trees and power creep issues currently dominate the 'meta builds' for many classes, but they are making adjustments as patches come through. That doesn't mean it's impossible to play your own unique build, just that there is probably a much easier version of your class that you could play instead. Still, the community continues to experiment and try out interesting new combinations on a regular basis. I'm hopeful that the new subclasses and 'old' class reworks will allow for rebalancing to effectively smooth out the power curve.

End-game needs a massive rework, and is mostly what I would consider 'legacy' at this point. The developers have continued to add new forms of content to the end-game, but have not had the chance to tweak the 'old grind' to match. This leads to your first many hours after the campaign being a slog through slow paced and easily cleared content. Once you clear that though, there are more challenging pieces of content ahead. Randomized modifiers need adjustment, but the overall feel is positive.

Many people continue to wait for the multiplayer patch which has been slated to come out this year. If you're someone who likes to play ARPGs with your friends I would recommend waiting for that patch to come.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"It has taken me several years to like and get into Crusader Kings 3. It's a complicated & intriguing game which always left me cold when my ruler died - as your precious realm is split apart by partition.

Recently I found a historical focused youtube series by 'Realm Builder Guy' (I highly recommend) who introduced me to the 'secret' of enjoying Crusader Kings:

[i]You are not there to build & defend a nation (a modern concept). Your role is to further your noble House influence and legacy, to bring stability and prosperity to your lands. CK3 is about Dynasty, not empire.[/i]

When I stopped trying to power-game the system, stopped frantically acquiring territory in a race to make a larger Kingdom, stopped making stress decisions 'out-of-character' for an advantage, the game started to click with me. Instead of jumping in trying to manage an entire Kingdom, I chose a humble English Earl in 1066 and spent 40 years tending to my family, my faith and the needs of my people.  The Pope granted us several Duchies from the heathens in Wales and suddenly we were a Duke. I had rivals, friends and a benign King who I served faithfully. It was completely absorbing.  

So that's my main advice for new players; ignore the huge kingdoms and the Irish tutorial, play someone small and navigate that persons life. Don't sweat your realm splitting up on death, focus on the wider picture of your House glory and the long game becomes much more compelling.

1627720,Lies of P,"My favorite thing about Lies of P is it's potential for player expression. You're allowed to beat the game (mostly) however you want. You can 'Perfect Guard' every encounter, dodge every enemy attack, or do a mixture of both whenever you see fit. Typically, there are better approaches to every fight, but the game will meet you on your own terms and give you the freedom to choose how you tackle it. You're allowed to build any weapon you want by combining different blades with different handles or use any special boss weapon from the various fights throughout the game. If you want to stick a giant wrench to the end of a dagger handle, you can. If you want to put a greatsword blade on a rapier hilt, you can. This simple tweak to a standard weapon selection system adds so much variety between every playthrough and every person's experience with the game.

You'll encounter several boss fights over your 30-hour playthrough of the game. Most of them are good, if not great, while a few of them not so much. Bosses are incredibly aggressive, but readable and reactable, say for a few 'Fury Attacks' which require memorization in timing as opposed to testing of reactions. I was actually surprised to see how many fantastic fights this game offers. There are several bosses I would understand seeing at the top of someone's favorite Lies of P boss list. The game is also a lot harder than I was expecting with several bosses taking over an hour, sometimes up to 3, to beat. 

Another thing to note is the game's story. I won't be giving any summary here, but I'm surprised at how invested I actually was in the characters and story surrounding them. It's a refreshing change to see a game in this genre with such a defined and explicit narrative. There were more than a few characters I grew to genuinely really like and feel for. Complementing the story is the great soundtrack through the game. This includes boss themes, as well as the vinyls you can obtain and play in the Hotel hub area. The songs used give the desolate and depressing world so much more life and context. The world of Lies of P is beautiful and feels lived-in and overrun by the puppets and corrupted roaming about. It could have done better with more impurities in the objects around the levels and architecture, but that's more of a nitpick than anything.

The game isn't perfect, however. It falters towards the end and stumbles in it's final act. After [spoiler]Laxasia[/spoiler] , you feel like you're closing in on the finale, but then it sort of just continues for a bit too long before the actual end of the game. The reason I take issue with this area is because up until this point the game has done an incredible job at making every location feel fresh with new or remixed enemy types, level design, and area visuals. But this final stretch feels like a retread of the last few areas without enough of a difference to warrant being included. You could argue that this serves as a sort of down-time before the final fight, but the enemies here are just as aggressive as usual and you'll probably end up running past all of them at this point.

All in all, Lies of P is one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory and surpassed the expectations I had for it by a  long shot. It's one of the best 'Soulslike' games I've had the privilege of playing, and I'm incredibly excited to see the upcoming DLC and whatever next game comes from this series.",favorite thing lie p potential player expression allowed beat game mostly however want perfect guard every encounter dodge every enemy attack mixture whenever see fit typically better approach every fight game meet term give freedom choose tackle allowed build weapon want combining different blade different handle use special bos weapon various fight throughout game want stick giant wrench end dagger handle want put greatsword blade rapier hilt simple tweak standard weapon selection system add much variety every playthrough every person experience game encounter several bos fight 30 hour playthrough game good great much boss incredibly aggressive readable reactable say fury attack require memorization timing opposed testing reaction actually surprised see many fantastic fight game offer several boss would understand seeing top someone favorite lie p bos list game also lot harder expecting several boss taking hour sometimes 3 beat another thing note game story giving summary surprised invested actually character story surrounding refreshing change see game genre defined explicit narrative character grew genuinely really like feel complementing story great soundtrack game includes bos theme well vinyl obtain play hotel hub area song used give desolate depressing world much life context world lie p beautiful feel lived overrun puppet corrupted roaming could done better impurity object around level architecture nitpick anything game perfect however falter towards end stumble final act spoiler laxasia spoiler feel like closing finale sort continues bit long actual end game reason take issue area point game done incredible job making every location feel fresh new remixed enemy type level design area visuals final stretch feel like retread last area without enough difference warrant included could argue serf sort time final fight enemy aggressive usual probably end running past point lie p one biggest sleeper hit recent memory surpassed expectation long shot one best soulslike game privilege playing incredibly excited see upcoming dlc whatever next game come series
1599340,Lost Ark,"For the new players that see the trailers for this game and think ""wow, this looks kind of fun!"", do not let the weird tags on the store page fool you.

Lost Ark is an 8-player exclusively title that costs $60 to play. 

""But"", you type on your keyboard, ""the game is free, why would I spend $60? Also, can't I play alone?""

No. Here is what will happen if you decide to not spend $60 on this game and do not have 7 friends to play with. You will get 50 hours into a game with the worst campaign, story, and characters you have ever seen with no meaningful content then quit thinking ""why do people even play this, this game sucks!"". Here's the rub: if you have not paid $60 for the South Vern powerpass and experienced the content that unlocks, you have literally not played the game. Lost Ark is not a game at this point of its life before the spot the South Vern pass drops you off at . It saves you 100 hours of the worst filler content you have ever seen. Trust me, there's no point touching this game at all without buying that pass, you will just have wasted all of your time.

But ok, let's see you put in that 100 hours legit since you're a masochist. You're raid ready now! Except you don't have 7 friends, so you're actually not raid ready ever. You see, the Lost Ark community is utter dogshit. You have never had the mispleasure of interacting with the most burned out, toxic, gatekeepy, sweaty fucks in your life before. If they aren't satisfied that you haven't put in thousands of hours in meaningless side content, thousands of dollars in money for more virtual numbers on your character, or god forbid both, you don't get to play with them. For the average player, this means you don't get to play endgame content at all.

So fuck them. Play with your friends. You don't wanna be a part of the Lost Ark community. You just want to be a person that *plays* Lost Ark. And you'll be much happier for doing so. Just run content when you and your friends are ready for it, and don't ever do anything in this game that you don't think is fun.

If you don't have $60 bucks and 7 friends (which I get it, it's hard to convince seven other people to commit $60 and part of their time every week for a multiplayer game), then play a different game honestly. Lost Ark is an excellent game but it's quite literally unplayable alone and for free.",new player see trailer game think wow look kind fun let weird tag store page fool lost ark 8 player exclusively title cost 60 play type keyboard game free would spend 60 also play alone happen decide spend 60 game 7 friend play get 50 hour game worst campaign story character ever seen meaningful content quit thinking people even play game suck rub paid 60 south vern powerpass experienced content unlocks literally played game lost ark game point life spot south vern pas drop save 100 hour worst filler content ever seen trust point touching game without buying pas wasted time ok let see put 100 hour legit since masochist raid ready except 7 friend actually raid ready ever see lost ark community utter dogshit never mispleasure interacting burned toxic gatekeepy sweaty fuck life satisfied put thousand hour meaningless side content thousand dollar money virtual number character god forbid get play average player mean get play endgame content fuck play friend wan na part lost ark community want person play lost ark much happier run content friend ready ever anything game think fun 60 buck 7 friend get hard convince seven people commit 60 part time every week multiplayer game play different game honestly lost ark excellent game quite literally unplayable alone free

For those looking at getting into the series, it's now much more accessible though some UI design decisions will probably leave you scratching your head until you are used to them.  This game doesn't have a learning cliff or even a learning curve - it's more of a learning slope. It's easy enough to get into and do the basics until the basics no longer work.. so you try something else the next playthough... rinse and repeat. It's impossible to do a tutorial for a game like this because there are so many things you can do right from the onset that will impact the rest of the game.

1966720,Lethal Company,"The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.

Its extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.
Hearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.
It truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.

PERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:
A monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.

"489830,1746860",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Unless there is a mod exclusive to Skyrim Legendary Edition, go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 [b][i](in layman's terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE)[/i][/b]. And if you haven't played Skyrim yet, you have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 10 years (and counting). Amazing first time RPG experience & one of the biggest modding scenes to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of replayability.

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Open-world fantasy RPG

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
After the introductory cutscene, you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let's be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehow, whether intentionally or not, end up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.

Join various factions ranging from the honorable Companions of Whiterun to the mysterious Dark Brotherhood. Complete quests to obtain various riches ranging from special enchanted weapon artifacts to brand new player housing. Follow the main quest and find out what is the reason behind dragons returning to Skyrim and what how exactly you are involved with everything.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
Skyrim SE was released in 2016 as a remaster of Skyrim LE with added graphical features including godrays, dynamic DOF, and environmental effects. There isn't any brand new vanilla content, but the land of Skyrim sure looks better in vanilla SE than in vanilla LE. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weapons, armors, wildlife, enemy types, dungeon types etc. 

In terms of performance, [b]vanilla[/b] SE runs much better than LE and is practically crash free since it isn't restricted by a small memory block like LE (that is not to say that the game [i]won't[/i] crash if you mod it with 400 mods). 

In any event, if you don't like something about the graphics, the issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing textures, adding new visual effects, adding an ENB, etc.). 

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
In the beginning, you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reason, you are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cart, including yourself, is about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sight, but fortunately it grants you freedom. After escaping, your story is up to you to make or discover.

Pursue the main quest and find out what that dragon was doing at the execution and what your role in these events is. Or choose to pursue other faction quests and enter the ranks of various guilds around Skyrim. Or ignore everything and just wander in a direction until you reach a new unvisited landmark and explore what lies ahead.

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Skyrim is reputable for having a big, open-world where one tagline for advertisement was ""if you see it, you can go to it"". In most cases, this is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim's borders). If you see a mountain in the distance, by all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thus, there is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.

•The non-radiant (non-repeatable) quests in Skyrim are pretty good. There are many stories for you to unravel and be a part of. If you are finding a questline to be a bit boring, you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future.

•You really are free to build the class/playstyle you want to; if you want to get better at Skill x, just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don't.

•[b]Mods[/b]. Modding Skyrim becomes its own game once you enter the wormhole of modding. If you can imagine it, someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a city, revamp the game's perk system, add a custom follower, or change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage, there's a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you ""I've spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point"". Most, if not all, mods are available in both LE and SE, and certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven't already been converted.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•In modern day standards, the combat of Skyrim is pretty awful, particularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn't feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attack, you won't really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very ""floaty"" and otherwise unimpressive.

•I think most players agree that the Civil War storyline overall isn't very interesting/is pretty buggy in the vanilla game.

•You will probably encounter various NPC's that share voice actors given that there are so many NPC's (usually given backstories) in the game and a limited amount of voice actors during the making of Skyrim. Although usually the important NPC's are uniquely voiced which is a plus.

•The modding process can be pretty overwhelming to newcomers. Veterans will tell you to test mods one at a time because if you should choose to install 10 mods at once and the game crashes to the desktop at launch, you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn't expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don't need.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9/10

Skyrim is a timeless game that continues to live on because you can replay it forever, but differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthrough.

582660,Black Desert,"I have now 5.660,5 hours on this account besides this I have a Beta account that I played on when the game came out. Aka let me tell you about the game that will make you lose your mind in multiple ways.

If you like exploring, traveling, following a story, questing and lifeskilling you will be drawn to this game from the get go. Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design. 

When the game just came out it was mostly grinding for a long amount of hours. For a regular player it took around 20 to 40 hours of playtime to get to lvl 50. Now the game has turned into a fresh start friendly game where you get to lvl 50 in just 1 hour of grinding. The game also gives new players tons of stuff to help you to get further into the game. This is not just a MMORPG. It's a Korean MMORPG. This means you will have to grind a fuck ton to be able to do anything besides the things i listed above here. PVP wont be possible if you dont put any time into the game.

Now to the beautiful fail stack system. This is BS RNG based but keeps the game fun if you don't have a temper. The game can make you super frustrated but when you manage to reach your goal you will have a feeling of accomplishment. 

IF RNG IS NOT YOUR THING DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!

When you read this you probably see comments about that the game is Pay to Win. This is BS. The game gives you tons of free stuff and it's easy to get the stuff you want by playing without spending money. But here is a big BUTT. If you want to lvl faster and get more money out of the time that you are grinding spending IRL money on pets/outfits could be an option.

The game end game is 100% focused on PVP. There are sometimes PVE events tho. 

This game is for the people that have a feeling that they need something to put a lot of time in. This is the solution for you. You will meet tons of people that you can play with. There are some guilds where I met tons of awesome players that don't mind to help new players out at all. 

If you checked all this text out Thanks and hopefully this was helpfull

1085660,Destiny 2,"With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:

This overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.

The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.

The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). 

With that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (""Last Wish"" from Forsaken, ""Garden of Salvation"" from Shadowkeep, ""The Deep Stone Crypt"" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). 

Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)

Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.

Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.

For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. 

The fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (""Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.

If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]

Eyes up, guardian.

Footnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:
-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.
-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.
-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. 
-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.

-----------------
TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Backstory :  I started with MS Flightsim on an amber screened IBM clone in 1987. It took several 'disks' to load, and I would go make coffee and  drink most of it before it would be loaded and ready to play. Looking back, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics to speak of, ran at less than 5 fps, and used a keyboard as input. In short, it was the equivalent of flying a very stubborn turkey. 

But I was hooked. ""One day, I mused - this will be real. One day places will look like it does in the real world. One day planes will feel like planes, not just an illusion of something clearly being tortured on a screen. 

Finally,  37 years later, 'one day' is here. 

I can nitpick little flaws in this game, like the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent, and it slows down substantially around massive built up areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. But these are minor. And  though I am sure they will be ironed out, I could also live with the game as is, because all the rest is just so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It not just great, its phenomenal. 


I've been a hopeless pilot, trying my best for years and years, and I'm still rubbish at it. However, this simulator is a quantum leap from the ones before. I can actually land every time without crashing when realism is maxed out.  The actual simulation of flight systems and avionics has been vastly improved, making it so much easier to hand fly aircraft  than in previous iterations.  It actually feels like you are flying a plane, not a simulation.  It actually feels like you are in your hometown when flying over it. (And no - that house you are flying into looks nothing like your actual house. In fact it could be mine.  )

Sometimes a product comes along that changes everything about its genre. This will change flight simulation forever. This is groundbreaking.

So seeing this being delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky,  makes me so unbelievably happy. It gives me untold pleasure to admit: ""Its finally here and its better than I ever imagined possible""

I'm not going to complain about a single thing, when, for $60, I can go fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy the world. Fly over a place and exclaim: ""This actually does look like it does in real life."" How ungrateful would I be If I lamented the hours and hours it took to download, when, by the end of it, the whole world exists on a little setup in the corner of my lounge.  Honestly, some people.

I am one very happy gamer today. Always knew this day would come. It did, and its simply mind blowing.",backstory started m flightsim amber screened ibm clone 1987 took several disk load would go make coffee drink would loaded ready play looking back simply atrocious graphic speak ran le 5 fps used keyboard input short equivalent flying stubborn turkey hooked one day mused real one day place look like real world one day plane feel like plane illusion something clearly tortured screen finally 37 year later one day nitpick little flaw game like fact frame rate inconsistent slows substantially around massive built area drone camera system somewhat cumbersome flight planning could lot user friendly adding ordering waypoints minor though sure ironed could also live game rest far ahead anything else ever seen great phenomenal hopeless pilot trying best year year still rubbish however simulator quantum leap one actually land every time without crashing realism maxed actual simulation flight system avionics vastly improved making much easier hand fly aircraft previous iteration actually feel like flying plane simulation actually feel like hometown flying house flying look nothing like actual house fact could mine sometimes product come along change everything genre change flight simulation forever groundbreaking seeing delivered get go big refrigerator sky make unbelievably happy give untold pleasure admit finally better ever imagined possible going complain single thing 60 go fly anywhere faithfully recreated virtual copy world fly place exclaim actually look like real life ungrateful would lamented hour hour took download end whole world exists little setup corner lounge honestly people one happy gamer today always knew day would come simply mind blowing
306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"[h1] Gamble's ESO REVIEW [/h1]
[i] After spending over 4000 hours i feel its time to voice my personal opinion about the game. [/i]

[b] My Own Experience [/b]
I first started The Elder Scrolls online when the Vvardenfell DLC released roughly Mid June 2017, after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again. I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universe, playing most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chance. 

I purchased the normal game standard edition which is the base game. To buy the DLC for the game there are a few options such as straight up buy the DLC which will cost you crowns (they do sometimes have offers for these) or you can buy into their ESO+ subscription. From a fresh point of view, i was thinking ""do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game"". After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out it was HIGHLY BENEFICIAL, you get a lot of perks such as:
[list]
    [*]Access to all current and future DLC's 
    [*]Unlimited crafting bag (Go nuts and pick up everything!)
    [*]Double Bank Space
    [*]10% more gold/xp
[/list]
[i] HINT [/i]
I would recommend you buy the base game first, see if you enjoy the game and if you think you will play the game longer buy ESO+ honestly that crafting bag is life, a lot of people from my experience say ""i cant live without this anymore"". and the fact that you get access to all the DLC content is just fantastic.

[b]Factions in the game [/b]
Before playing the game i did some research to find out the best race and class to choose for each role. Like other games i played i wanted to see what each class had to offer e.g. which class did the most dps, who was the best healer or the most beefy tank. When picking a race you are also choosing a certain faction depending where that race comes from in the world, which is one of 3:
[list]
    [*]Daggerfall Covenant (Blue)
    [*]Ebonheart Pact (Red)
    [*]Aldmeri Dominion ( Yellow)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Now a days there is an option to buy ""any race any faction bundle"" which some people might see as annoying and an excuse for the devs to take more of your money. However this is mainly aimed at open world pvp, so unless you are going to pvp a lot or want to be in the same faction as your friends, pick any race which you find appealing. There is always the option to make another character of the same faction to play with friends.

[b] Classes currently in the game [/b]
I remember the first Character i ever made was a Warden, As the DLC had just released and not many people had played it i thought it would be good fun. Later down the line however i learnt the hard way the bear can be annoying. There is a way to control your bear so it doesn't randomly pull mobs in trials or the boss at the end. I remember doing this many times :D  but i was never told and it was never obvious there was a button to press for your bear companion to be non hostile. 

Many of the classes tool-kits have been changed which has lead to them getting buffed and nerfed either many times or a few times. Honestly sometimes it feels like the devs are unsure how to balance some of the skills in the class. They either go from one extreme to making it powerful or not very useful and weak. Saying that now a days if you wanted to play, there are so many different sets to wear in the game to help you out, if you want more damage or need better sustain. Please see the list below of the current classes in the game so far.
[list]
    [*]Templar 
    [*]Sorcerer
    [*]Dragonknight
    [*]Nightblade
    [*]Warden (Crown Store)
    [*]Necromancer (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[b] Races currently in the game [/b]
I enjoyed the customisation different races, you get given lots of choices to make your characters look unique and different. E.g a fat male Wood Elf dressed as a belly dancer, or a fancy Orc with a moustache. Please see the list below for current races in the game
[list]
    [*]Breton
    [*]Redguard
    [*]Orc
    [*]Nord
    [*]Argonian
    [*]Dark Elf
    [*]Khajiit
    [*]Wood Elf
    [*]High Elf
    [*]Imperial (Crown Store)
[/list] 
[i] HINT [/i]
Honestly unless you want to min/max your character, you don't really have to worry about choosing which race and class to play. Now a days there isn't too much different between all the races. Other then that just have fun! Try out many classes and see which suits your play style.

[b] What is there to do in the game? [/b]
When first playing I was not sure what to expect but i knew that i wanted to have fun and see all the different things the game offered such as:
[list]
    [*]Map zones (Questing, Fishing, Skyshards, Dolmens)
    [*]PVP (Battlegrounds, Imperial city, Cyrodiil)
    [*]Trials (12 player content)
    [*]Guilds (Trials, progression, trading, Roleplaying, causal) 
    [*]Dueling (Tournaments)
    [*]Housing (Competitons)
    [*]Achievement hunting 
    [*]Arena's ( 4 player content and single player content)
    [*] In-Game Events 
    [*] Dungeons (4 player content, normal and vet)
[/list]
[b] Positives [/b]
Lots of helpful and friendly guilds, there are so many guilds in the game you could almost go as far to call them small communities, usually in a guild if you need help or are unsure they will answer any questions you have about the game.

Progression guilds, are great if you want to get into the end game content, unlike other guilds that require x amount of dps, progression guilds normally don't have such a high benchmark and love to help train new people, give advise and explain the mechanics of tougher content.

You never know when you will make friends, the amount of times i have been doing something random and then i just become good friends with a person is crazy, A lot of people are nice and are willing to help if you have any questions.

So much lore in the game to explore, as the game takes place in the past you can see what the world used to be like.

[b] Negatives [/b]
FPS seems to be an issue when pvping in open world e.g. you run into so many loading screens, or come against so many players that your PC cant keep up and your skill bar doesn't work. 

When trying to get into a dungeon, that can be quite the experience, sometimes even with a full group the finder doesn't seem to work, people can leave randomly halfway through a dungeon, they can just be rude and run most the dungeon and skip bosses. PUG AT YOUR OWN RISK! that's right your heard me, when trying to randomly enter a vet dlc dungeon yikes. It is honestly like gambling with your time, you will either get a really good group, or a terrible group of people who get mad, blame others and leave. 

Dry End game content, sadly this isn't the most challenging game of all time. When you get later into the game with more experience and understand the mechanics from the dungeons, you lose that sense of its a challenge. The same can go for trials, with all the top end raiding guilds out there, they go and smash so many of these trials in record times each patch. 

Steam Login issues, sometimes after a long maintenance you find that some people are able to login fine but people who brought the game on Steam have to wait hours more to play the game.

[b] Overall [/b]
I have really enjoyed my time playing this game, from the social aspect i have met so many people in different guilds, who have become good real life friends. Sometimes in guilds they run so many events like, make the ugliest outfit, dungeon races, fishing together in a group of 20+ or just dress the same as a guild and bombard a town by dancing everywhere. I WOULD RECOMMEND this game if you want to be part of a good community, who loves the ESO lore and wants to have fun, there are honestly so many guilds out there which offer a lot!

489830,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Unless there is a mod exclusive to Skyrim Legendary Edition, go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 [b][i](in layman's terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE)[/i][/b]. And if you haven't played Skyrim yet, you have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 10 years (and counting). Amazing first time RPG experience & one of the biggest modding scenes to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of replayability.

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Open-world fantasy RPG

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
After the introductory cutscene, you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let's be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehow, whether intentionally or not, end up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.

Join various factions ranging from the honorable Companions of Whiterun to the mysterious Dark Brotherhood. Complete quests to obtain various riches ranging from special enchanted weapon artifacts to brand new player housing. Follow the main quest and find out what is the reason behind dragons returning to Skyrim and what how exactly you are involved with everything.

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
Skyrim SE was released in 2016 as a remaster of Skyrim LE with added graphical features including godrays, dynamic DOF, and environmental effects. There isn't any brand new vanilla content, but the land of Skyrim sure looks better in vanilla SE than in vanilla LE. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weapons, armors, wildlife, enemy types, dungeon types etc. 

In terms of performance, [b]vanilla[/b] SE runs much better than LE and is practically crash free since it isn't restricted by a small memory block like LE (that is not to say that the game [i]won't[/i] crash if you mod it with 400 mods). 

In any event, if you don't like something about the graphics, the issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing textures, adding new visual effects, adding an ENB, etc.). 

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
In the beginning, you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reason, you are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cart, including yourself, is about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sight, but fortunately it grants you freedom. After escaping, your story is up to you to make or discover.

Pursue the main quest and find out what that dragon was doing at the execution and what your role in these events is. Or choose to pursue other faction quests and enter the ranks of various guilds around Skyrim. Or ignore everything and just wander in a direction until you reach a new unvisited landmark and explore what lies ahead.

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Skyrim is reputable for having a big, open-world where one tagline for advertisement was ""if you see it, you can go to it"". In most cases, this is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim's borders). If you see a mountain in the distance, by all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thus, there is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.

•The non-radiant (non-repeatable) quests in Skyrim are pretty good. There are many stories for you to unravel and be a part of. If you are finding a questline to be a bit boring, you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future.

•You really are free to build the class/playstyle you want to; if you want to get better at Skill x, just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don't.

•[b]Mods[/b]. Modding Skyrim becomes its own game once you enter the wormhole of modding. If you can imagine it, someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a city, revamp the game's perk system, add a custom follower, or change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage, there's a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you ""I've spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point"". Most, if not all, mods are available in both LE and SE, and certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven't already been converted.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•In modern day standards, the combat of Skyrim is pretty awful, particularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn't feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attack, you won't really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very ""floaty"" and otherwise unimpressive.

•I think most players agree that the Civil War storyline overall isn't very interesting/is pretty buggy in the vanilla game.

•You will probably encounter various NPC's that share voice actors given that there are so many NPC's (usually given backstories) in the game and a limited amount of voice actors during the making of Skyrim. Although usually the important NPC's are uniquely voiced which is a plus.

•The modding process can be pretty overwhelming to newcomers. Veterans will tell you to test mods one at a time because if you should choose to install 10 mods at once and the game crashes to the desktop at launch, you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn't expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don't need.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9/10

Skyrim is a timeless game that continues to live on because you can replay it forever, but differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthrough.

294100,RimWorld,"I had a cool doctor in my colony, but he got old and lost his hearing. I decided to replace his ears with bionic ones, but I didn’t notice that he was a Body Purist who hated artificial body parts.

While he was lying on the operating table and recovering from the surgery, a huge raid happened. The raiders built siege weapons and attacked us with rockets and mortars. I managed to fight them off, but one of my colonists died. It was the doctor’s spouse.

The doctor woke up with pain, grief, and anger. He dug up his spouse’s corpse and brought it to the main hall, where he laid it on a table. This made everyone else unhappy and stressed.

One of my colonists was a cannibal, and he was hungry and wounded from the raid. He saw the corpse on the table and decided to eat it. This triggered a mental breakdown in the doctor, who attacked the cannibal. They started a brawl that soon involved other colonists.

One of my colonists was a pyromaniac, and he was also stressed and angry. He grabbed a flamethrower and started to set everything on fire. The fire spread quickly and engulfed most of the base.

The doctor had an infection from the surgery, and he was bleeding and feverish. He was also the best doctor in the colony, so no one else could treat him properly. He died on the floor, surrounded by flames and blood.

By the time a mysterious stranger in a cloak came to help us (when everyone was downed and helpless), it was too late. Most of the base was burned down, and most of the colonists were dead or dying. The only survivor was the drug addict, who had taken all the drugs in the colony and wandered off to a meadow. He died there peacefully.

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"I'm incredibly happy to see the injection of new players after WoW shat the bed with Shadowlands and 9.1. I played WoW for nearly a decade of my life and through every expansion to endgame, and I have to say that Blizzard doesn't hold a candle to ANYTHING Square Enix has pushed out for FFXIV. Allow me to explain, starting with the cons of FFXIV:

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buying the game can be frustrating. There are two methods: through Steam or through Square Enix's websites. If you buy it on one platform you cannot use it on the other. [strike]I [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend looking something up to walk you through it.[/strike] Square Enix has updated their website and the Mogstation to make it easier to purchase the game and the expansions through their client. I recommend taking this route rather than through Steam.
[/list]

[h1] The Middling [/h1]
Now, this isn't necessarily a negative, but some might think so.
[list]
[*] This is a story-driven game. It can be difficult to play with friends to go through quests since many of the main story quests will have you go into an instance by yourself. There are hundreds of hours of main story quests (it's thicc af), and almost all of it is good; however, some expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other. ARR (vanilla) is arguably the worst, but begins to pick up about halfway through, and the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives I've seen in an MMORPG. The newest expansion, Endwalker, has surpassed Shadowbringers in terms of story quality in my opinion.
[*] You can skip entire portions of story quests by purchasing story skips from the Mogstation. If you have disposable income and don't really care for the story, then you can buy these. You can also purchase cosmetics, orchestration rolls, housing items, and emotes via the cash-shop in the Mogstation. I personally never look at these because there is an abundance of content in the game already.
[*] Add-ons are against the terms of service since PC players and console players are playing together and add-ons that affect the game's code create unfair gameplay between the two. However, the game functions just fine without them.
[*] Buying the current expansion also unlocks all of the expansions before it. However, the same rules apply as it does setting up your account. You have to buy the base game [b]and[/b] the expansion on the same platform otherwise it won't work.
[/list]

[h1] The Good/Excellent [/h1]
As previously stated, I've played WoW for years, and the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoyment.
[list]
[*] [b] Your character can be every single class and profession (in FFXIV terms, jobs) and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse. [/b] This game respects your time immensely. Tired of playing the Archer/Bard? No problem! Switch on over to your Gladiator/Paladin and nothing changes except your class. Not only that, but classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled class.
[*] Classes are all unique and morph into specialized classes. Class categories share a small pool of general abilities, like basic defensives or casting modifiers.
[*] There are daily quests, mostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies. You can do 12 of these a day, and they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation. It might sound like a small amount of dailies, but the reputation gain is proportional. And better yet, flying isn't gated behind getting reputation with these factions (thank god). The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it (other than faction-specific mounts and pets and whatnot).
[*] The subscription is cheaper than WoW, and they give you veteran rewards every few months that you're subscribed.
[*] Chocobo racing and Gold Saucer nonsense. Be sure the play the mini and jumbo Cactpot (I call the jumbo Cactpot the Cuckedpot though because you'll never win the jackpot).
[*] The UI is entirely customizable down to the colors of enemy and friendly health bars. No need for an add-on or anything to change stuff around.
[*] Random drops exist, but that's not really the focus of the gear game, especially at end game content. Many duties (FFXIV's equivalent to dungeons and raids) will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for [b] specific [/b] pieces of gear. This means you don't have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeks, and instead just buy an equivalent piece instead.
[*] Gearing up a class at endgame is incredibly fast so that you can get into the meat and potatoes of the hardcore raiding content.
[*] The duties are all unique and bosses rarely repeat mechanics from other duties. Most of the duties don't have artificial difficulty scalers, like arbitrarily more health or damage. Instead, bosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics. Savage, Extreme, Unreal, and Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS check, but when you're doing these you know what you're in for and what is required.
[*] Duties have their own unique soundtrack, and many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music. Honestly, most of it is top tier music.
[*] Almost all previous content is brought forward into the new expansion or content patch. Dungeons from ARR still reward currency that is usable at max level. Some unique content from previous expansions are expanded on and given new activities to do. Gear/stat scaling is applied in a remarkably balanced way. Square Enix routinely patches current and past content, all the way back to 2.0 (ARR vanilla).
[*] The game is pretty. Gear sets are unique to each dungeon, trial, or raid, and many have dyeable versions that can be crafted (I'm looking at you, WoW, with your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion). Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficulty, or they follow a certain theme. Regardless, the equipment will look different and rarely is it recolored.
[*] Raids and trials aren't long endeavors that take hours upon hours to complete, or even days. Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hour, and if you're there for more than an hour then you're doing something very very wrong.
[*] The crafting in this game is just [i] chef kiss.[/i] The same materials are used more or less throughout the whole game and can be farmed very easily. Not only that, but the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make high-quality craftables. In fact, it gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good. There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mounts, minions (pets), and cosmetics.
[*] The list goes on, but go see for yourself. The free trial includes ARR and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played. There are, however, some restrictions regarding social functions and in-game marketboard stuff.
[/list]

[h1] The Verdict: 9/10 [/h1]

It also respects your time. The free trial is also exceptionally generous.",incredibly happy see injection new player wow shat bed shadowlands 9 1 played wow nearly decade life every expansion endgame say blizzard hold candle anything square enix pushed ffxiv allow explain starting con ffxiv h1 bad h1 list buying game frustrating two method steam square enix website buy one platform use strike b highly b recommend looking something walk strike square enix updated website mogstation make easier purchase game expansion client recommend taking route rather steam list h1 middling h1 necessarily negative might think list story driven game difficult play friend go quest since many main story quest go instance hundred hour main story quest thicc af almost good however expansion better others theme build arr vanilla arguably worst begin pick halfway rest expansion excellent shadowbringers one best narrative seen mmorpg newest expansion endwalker surpassed shadowbringers term story quality opinion skip entire portion story quest purchasing story skip mogstation disposable income really care story buy also purchase cosmetic orchestration roll housing item emotes via cash shop mogstation personally never look abundance content game already add ons term service since pc player console player playing together add ons affect game code create unfair gameplay two however game function fine without buying current expansion also unlocks expansion however rule apply setting account buy base game b b expansion platform otherwise work list h1 good excellent h1 previously stated played wow year following game mechanic feature completely outstrip wow term functionality enjoyment list b character every single class profession ffxiv term job switch literally click mouse b game respect time immensely tired playing archer bard problem switch gladiator paladin nothing change except class class receive something called armory bonus increase experience gained maximum leveled class class unique morph specialized class class category share small pool general ability like basic defensive casting modifier daily quest mostly form beast tribe daily 12 day reward unique currency spend faction along reputation might sound like small amount daily reputation gain proportional better yet flying gated behind getting reputation faction thank god reason pro due fact hold bearing anything else game nothing locked behind faction specific mount pet whatnot subscription cheaper wow give veteran reward every month subscribed chocobo racing gold saucer nonsense sure play mini jumbo cactpot call jumbo cactpot cuckedpot though never win jackpot ui entirely customizable color enemy friendly health bar need add anything change stuff around random drop exist really focus gear game especially end game content many duty ffxiv equivalent dungeon raid reward random drop token currency trade b specific b piece gear mean grind raid trial specific drop week instead buy equivalent piece instead gearing class endgame incredibly fast get meat potato hardcore raiding content duty unique boss rarely repeat mechanic duty duty artificial difficulty scaler like arbitrarily health damage instead boss rely complex interesting mechanic savage extreme unreal ultimate bos fight also scale health damage require certain dp check know required duty unique soundtrack many boss also unique soundtrack battle music honestly top tier music almost previous content brought forward new expansion content patch dungeon arr still reward currency usable max level unique content previous expansion expanded given new activity gear stat scaling applied remarkably balanced way square enix routinely patch current past content way back 2 0 arr vanilla game pretty gear set unique dungeon trial raid many dyeable version crafted looking wow reskinned gear set every dungeon expansion harder difficulty content duty reward equipment look completely different previous difficulty follow certain theme regardless equipment look different rarely recolored raid trial long endeavor take hour upon hour complete even day almost completed le hour hour something wrong crafting game chef kiss material used le throughout whole game farmed easily game incentivizes use crafting ability make high quality craftables fact give option craft quickly take time really get good good also different type crafting activity involve item classified collectable reward special currency nifty mount minion pet cosmetic list go go see free trial includes arr award winning heavensward expansion level 60 restriction amount time played however restriction regarding social function game marketboard stuff list h1 verdict 9 10 h1 ffxiv one best mmorpgs currently available storyline hook deep gill game many quality life feature surpass competitor also respect time free trial also exceptionally generous

2338770,NBA 2K24,"Alright, I will leave an actual review, instead of just calling 2k ""racist towards pc"" (which they are). I personally am enjoying the game, but that is because I play with my brother and I took 2k23 off, so I have been waiting over a year to play 2k.

In this game, 2k really did less then the bare minimum. Literally the only thing new in this game is the park design. Everything else is the same (or has been completely removed).

This game is not next gen, which is a huge slap in the face to the PC community, since PC hardware is so much better than that of the PS5 or XBOX. They say nobody plays the game on PC, but clearly that is a flat out lie based on all of these reviews.

Aside from not being next gen, here are the other issues I have with the game:

1. No voice chat - This has been an issue on PC for forever, and makes the game feel kind of lonely. Why is voice chat not enabled? I cant talk to the people I play with or attempt to make new friends over the game. Not having voice chat in 2024 is just unacceptable.

2. No myCareer story - They removed the story entirely, so there is basically no reason to play single player myCareer. If I want to play single player games, I will just use player lock on myLeague. 

3. MyCareer is too hard - I usually play myCareer on HoF difficulty, but this year it is impossible to do so. My teammates cannot make a single open shot and ALWAYS take contested layups or midranges. On the other hand, the CPU makes everything they take, even if they are contested. I even dropped the difficulty down to allstar, and it is still not enjoyable.

4. No Myteam - Never really got into myteam, but they basically took it out entirely. I feel bad for anyone who actually bought 2k for myTeam.

5. Season progression is WAY too fast with NO rewards - I have played 16 rec games in 17 hours on the game, and I am already lvl 40 on the season pass with 39 days until the season ends. What am I supposed to play for now? There are no good rewards in this game that warrant me to put the time in. I feel bad for anybody that bought the season pass, because the rewards are awful. You unlock mascots, but not really. You unlock the OPPORTUNITY to spend $100 worth of VC to buy one.

6. Too many hackers - There has got to be an anticheat...there just has to be. Park is LOADED with hackers, like literally one on every court. Rec isnt as bad as park, but I have played with one on my team, and it just made the game not enjoyable. This is only day 5, I am sure they will get worse as time goes on.

7. Everything is too expensive - 2k forces you to spend money on VC if you want the game to be at least somewhat enjoyable. The 100k VC I got from the League pass edition only put my character to a 72 OVR, that is just not fun. Now I can only get 1000 VC per game, which means I have to play like 300 games just to get my player to a 99...Ill pass on that.

In conclusion, these are the main complaints I have, but I am sure as I keep playing I will find more. The fact that they took away more features than they added - and charged FULL PRICE - should be illegal. This game can be fun, and I am sure I will enjoy myleague (I hope), but it should be $10 MAX.

2338770,NBA 2K24,"This is one of the worst releases in the history of Video Games. 
I wanted to start off by mentioning that 2k is worth Billions of US Dollars, by the 2800 reviews already, not a person is happy with their NBA 2K24 steam gaming experience. The 2K developers clearly don't listen to the community and they think this is fair charging full price for 2017 Technology. This game is current gen on a single platform server, no cross platform. 
My ultimate question is why my $4,000 PC with a 4070ti graphics card cannot run the current Generation NBA 2K24. Or at least why it isn't an option to buy the ""real"" game. 

If I could get a refund I would but unfortunately was gifted the game via Amazon giftcard as a Birthday present. Sadly the worst thing I got for my Birthday which is what lead me here to this review. After a couple hours on the game, not a thing feels optimized, the graphics are so underpar even on max settings it' crazy to think the 2K creator teams think this is worthy. I just want the 2K17 experience back where there was a wide range of skill, builds, as well as creativity.

The last thing to mention is that in the first week of release, somehow half the player base is 99 overall with ridiculous myPlayer clothing that is practically priceless. If you're not cheating with 99 overall your'e simply not WINNING.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"I've never really enjoyed playing MMOs, and I've tried [b]MANY[/b] of them. Most of the time those games were Pay2Win, with bland combat mechanics and uninteresting story with generic quests such as ""kill 3 big ugly monsters"" or ""I'm too lazy to harvest a flower I really need to brew my potion, grab it for me"", and so on. 

SWTOR is different. You have 1 storyline per class and there are 8 of them. 4 Empire, 4 Republic. It took me around 15 hours to complete the PROLOGUE of my first class, without even exploring a lot or doing a bunch of side quests. And let me tell you, the story is fantastic and your choices matter. It's a BioWare game after all. 

Deep character customization, tons of different playstyles and an unbelievable amount of content to keep you busy for a long while. 

Absolutely recommended.

899770,Last Epoch,"Hello, 

credentials: 78hrs in Last Epoch, 3000+ hrs in PoE and other top down ARPG's.

My main comparison will be PoE as its the bench mark for the genre but by most means both games are not perfect.

Pros;
- Less Complex that PoE
- Fluid progression
- Easy to understand Game mechanics
- Easy to understand Endgame mapping system 
- Good Graphics
- Good immersion
- Good Music

Cons; 
This is a big one for me but if all you need is the then play the game but i will be doping it. 
- Meta Builds

Explanation: the game developers have selected a couple of abilities from each class that are viable for a beginner player then a several more skill viable once you have an established account e.g. have access to certain unique(s) that change a build from zero to hero. 

My experience is a Sentinel main class with Forge Guard Specialisation sub-class, using the ""Forge Strike"" as my main skill manual casting it.  I use Smite, Sigils of Hope, Ring of Shields, and a controversial shield bash which gets swapped out depending on the end game boss i'm fighting (for the guaranteed stun and block). 

However despite spending 13hrs with about 2hrs of intermediate break so about 11hrs and 39 attempts at killing a boss, the developers show to me that the game is better to play with the meta top 5 to 10 builds for beginners then if you want to play end game pick from the other meta builds once you have obtained the unique from your first build. 

This shows just like PoE despite having 1,000,000 build variants 5 to 10 are given love, then a had-full more. Don't get me wrong I understand the a very good game will require the illusion of diversity, but this game only offers surface level diversity. 

that why on one hand I would recommend the game if you have £30 to spend, but on the other hand you have PoE 2 and Diablo 4 just around the corner, which have promised to improve on these systems. 

thanks for taking the time to read.

"489830,1746860",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition,"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!

Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.

Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.

Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.

If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment; worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""

I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
Elden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I've ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft's 'Souls' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. 

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Fantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, 'Souls' game

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
Elden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain 'runes"" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. 

'Sites of grace' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.

Elden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.

[h1]GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:[/h1]
Elden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). 

In terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn't break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well. 
 
[h1]STORY:[/h1]
The long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a 'Tarnished' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to ""order"". (All of the details in between for NPC's and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Combat feels the best it has ever been for 'Souls' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.

•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn't.

•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)

•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.

•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough

•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.

•Just when you think you're near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.

•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring's story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•PC performance isn't stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. 

•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn't fully ""exit"" when you quit out until a while later.

•Early game bosses reappear as 'mini-bosses' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.

•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.

•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items

•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a ""connection error"" and the game boots you back to single player. 

•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don't just give up.

•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don't invade, but I've seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.

•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).

•'Great Runes' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. 

•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC's quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
9.9/10; easy recommend

Elden Ring has set my bar for 'open-world RPG' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game's action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can't wait for future DLC.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"I say No, but I mean 'not yet'. a lot of nice improvements were made, UI is ""better"" for the most part when in game, or at least more in-line with modern 4x games, as well as in closer parity with Conquest of Elysium games. My thoughts after only an hour or two:

- The idea of mount separation, while cool, seems like it's vulnerable for some balance issues with MR of mounts being significantly lower than basic units. 

+ separating planes, again borrowing from Conquest of Elysium 5, is a positive in my opinion. tethered with more terrain altering spells and it makes for fun possibilities

- several bugs, such as a LESS intuitive (or nonexistent) way to actually use saved pretenders? Dom5 had a 'load pretender' on the pretender sheet, yet that was decided to be removed? 

-/+ controls for positioning units seems a little more clunky in army setup screen, though I like that I can arrange all units without going in and out of each

+ new civs seem cool from first impressions, but havent played through any yet. still getting sea-legs on changes/additions

- Price, this game is listed at 45 USD (current sale at 38 USD), and releases around 6 years after Dom5. Initially this feels like a mistake given the peaks and valleys of quality when it comes to sprite use/work on new units and civs, seems less cohesive than Dom5 and ultimately to a lower standard.

Ultimately its a grab-bag of good and bad features and changes, that could, and will be a great game... just not yet. I expect a year from now I would be able to withdraw my criticisms if the past experience with IllWinter is anything, they often do an excellent job with patching and updating their games post-release

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Oh, where to begin?
Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike.
So...

What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on.
Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.

When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.

Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years. 

The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.

When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. 
So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?

First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating.
This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.

There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones.
Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled.
The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.

Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. 
Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.

I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has.
Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows. 

Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","I love this game, I really do. I'm a huge 40k nerd and love the setting, hell I even played VT2 and loved that. But there is no excuse for the game to be in the state its in, and you should wait for it to go on sale or avoid it entirely for 6 months - a year. Even at 40$ it's not worth the money, and here's why:

Terrible optimization
- Many players are incapable of running this game at acceptable frames if they're able to at all. It's not uncommon to see complaints of rigs capable of running much more graphically intensive games at well over a hundred FPS struggle to maintain 60 after decreasing resolutions and lowering settings. This isn't even mentioning how inconsistent it can be on lower end machines, from running better than several thousand dollar rigs, to locking up one's system entirely. Memory leaks, random client-side crashes, and inconsistent at best servers which have a nasty habit of disconnecting people at random times in matches or preventing people from even logging into the game to attempt to play. While its better than it was in the beta, it's still common enough to be a reoccurring complaint.

Missing Content and Micro-transactions
- While the game has released in a half finished state, not even having a fully functional crafting system which was a selling point of the game, one which has been walked back and clumsily so by the CM's from what was promised in marketing and hype vs what is being delivered (over the course of December if the updates are to be believed), the game has a fully functioning Micro transaction store which is several steps back from vermintide's system of buying cosmetics direct for cash. This one uses a premium currency, and had until very recently employed FOMO tactics by placing the MTX store on a weekly timer (the timer is no longer in the MTX store, though the stock has failed to refresh for some reason). I personally don't mind a MTX store, or premium currency, though I preferred VT's implementation. But having one implemented in the ""Full Release"" before the crafting system, full arsenal of promised weapons (some of which are in promotional trailers and on the box art and aren't in the game) and supposedly the other 3/4 of the game is a slap in the face.

Anti-Player Tactics:
- While many are split on the implementation of the Coherency mechanic present in Darktide, many of the ""achievements"" (penances) for character progression are designed in such a way that it encourages players to either completely subvert or nearly actively troll matches to accomplish them. Some can't be completed without a full stack of coordinated players, and while there should be rewards for difficult things, they should be for all those who participate in a difficult challenge, not a moderately interesting T-Shirt for one team member. There are many more balance, design, and account issues which contribute to this beyond in game achievements, and I suggest you peruse the forums for a more varied series of accounts on this like the lack of either any or commensurate reward for completing challenges, beating optional bosses, or completing secondary objectives and the absurdly designed loot/shop systems with completely RNG weapon selection and weapon stat/blessing rolls.

Balance and Jank
- The game's servers have severe issues with hit-reg, spawns are janky and inconsistent, dodges don't dodge they temporarily break tracking so even if you're far enough away from an enemy to watch them whiff their strike you'll take damage, dodging with a ranged weapon doesn't break tracking so you'll get hit regardless, key combat components don't function consistently (suppression, melee challenging shooters, dodging disablers, the ""you're about to be hit from behind so you need to turn around/spidey sense"" noise not triggering consistently, etc), the game will spawn enemies directly behind you after clearing areas allowing enemies to get free hits, weapons are under powered across the board which makes the few properly tuned weapons stand out like they're op juggernauts, many talents (perks/skills) are broken/worded poorly/don't function at all/ or are severely underwhelming, the Veteran class dominates the game as it is one of the most optimally tuned classes with a solid answer to everything despite being marketed as a back line ""sharp shooter"", Zealot and Psyker have been significantly nerfed since the Closed Beta Test, stagger from incoming toughness damage often puts players in a death spiral on higher difficulties due to it staggering your movement and preventing you from getting out of fire, **as of 12/15/20 zealot's ultimate has been fixed**, every class in the game barring ogryn can nuke elite enemies faster than the dedicated elite hunter (psyker), blessings and perks on weapons can be counter intuitive and useless (like a reload speed bonus on weapons that don't use ammo), and many many many more issues. I again suggest looking on the forums for a more complete understanding.

Zero Endgame or Story
- One of the game's marketing tactics was to advertise that Dan Abnett, writer of the critically acclaimed Gaunt's Ghost's and Eisenhorn 40k Book Series wrote the story for this game. Much like the rest of the game, most of the story is missing as well. While I won't spoil the little that is provided, it's fair to say that the development team got confused between implementing the story and implementing the story board, as (and I say this without hyperbole) have read sparknotes with more detail and complexity. If Dan Abnett wrote this, they must've stolen the basic outline he wrote on a coffee shop napkin and ran with it. Additionally, there is no reason to max level your character other than to unlock the whole talent tree. You get no higher drop chance for better weapons, there are no incentives other than money (which is plentiful) to complete more difficult missions, you get no special missions or new modifiers. The best you get are decorative cosmetics and some changed voicelines among ambient NPCs in the HUB area. Everything is designed around artificial player retention, and a level 30 player with 30 hours on a character, due to the RNG, may have the same gameplay benefits as a level 30 player with 300 hours, personal skill not withstanding. There are 5 difficulties and 13 maps (supposedly), many are thematically identical, and while 40k is supposed to be grim dark, the series has a wealth of environments to choose from, even in a hive city which could've been implemented to introduce meaningful variety.

The End
- I could keep writing reasons why you shouldn't buy this game, but I will not as many have done so before me already. The core gameplay loop is amazing, despite its flaws, and here in a year or so i'm sure it will polish out. But you shouldn't buy this game. Fat Shark already made two tide games, the second entry in the series being a prime example of a phenomenal change from bad to good as the team polished the game up significantly over the years. But all of that progress is gone, all of the strides they'd made with QOL and gameplay, balance, combat, communication, transparency, etc have all been washed away. Somehow being the third Tide title, they've taken 2 steps backwards and none forwards. The entire community is very confused as to how the game has turned out as it has, and the fumbling of the Community Managers with regard to responding to these questions and criticisms has done nothing but evaporate goodwill and seed doubt. Despite what Hedge (a prominent community manager) will tell you, this game is in Early Access, and if you've played it you know it, regardless of how fun and enjoyable it may be. The game is not finished, and even with it being as fun as it is, it's not worth 40$ by any stretch of the imagination. Buy it if you like fun early access games or being a beta tester, but if you want a polished product you'll be left wanting.

1222670,The Sims™ 4,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE SHIT OUT OF IT!!


Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)

With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**

Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)

Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)

Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)

Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)

Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)

There is also a shit load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.",tldr buy base sims 4 buy heavily discounted bundled one major expansion season pet mod shit base sims 4 nearly unplayable due lack content repetitive easily manipulative emotion system overall feeling restriction damaging game series designed around player freedom also many irritating quality make seem like fine tweaked enough every single sim social butterfly get stop talking five second take long eat lot small empty nearly nothing sims 3 heck even sims 2 brought horse car pool restaurant grocery store fun recreational activity ect said classic sim fun game able get heavily discounted price get bundled one major expansion would recommend either pet season would also highly recommend downloading plethora mod fix vast majority system base sims 4 make enjoyable mod thing would think twice purchasing game one easiest game mod fyi mod recommendation like seriously even play base sims 4 downloading mod sims 4 mod manager raxdiam necessary convenient easy way keep track mod user friendly 100 work meaningful story roburky mod pack effectively revamps mood emotion system sims 4 make system feel waaay fleshed realistic significantly le manipulatable better romance simler90 add rule check sims romance one another base sims 4 basically always guaranteed succeed romance quite literally way fail mod expands heavily upon making trait sims impact whether accept advance wonderful whim turbodriver go great better romance compatibility issue aware add attractiveness system first impression personality archetype even menstrual cycle birth control system equipped design sims overall sexuality sexual life hugely rewarding designed perfectly seem like natural part game also shit load cc custom content like clothes hair building sims ect mod sims best place find spend money stuff pack stuff included find free made someone online usually look nicer

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"Well after almost 130 hours played I think I can tell my opinion about this game. 
So don't get me wrong I absolutely love it, I love ARK and I wouldn't have bought it again if I didn't BUT I just can't recommend it in its current state. It's just BAD, from the optimization which is absolutely garbage, trust me this has to be the most unoptimized game in the history of unoptimized games even with a decent PC you still barely hit 60-70 fps and if you are in a place with a lot of vegetation or a lot of creatures around you attacking and stuff like that the game drops to 30-40 fps or in the most extreme cases you have a fps drop to 15-20 fps. To all the bugs that it has, old (same bugs from the original game) and new ones and constant crashes which I don't understand how it is not an urgent matter for the devs to fix. You trying to do a cave? Killing tons of creatures attacking you? crash, you try to fly across the map on your dino? crash, you literally just stay in one place breathing? crash. It's mostly random sometimes you can go hours or not at all without a crash or you can crash 5 times in a row trying to do something. I once had the game paused watching a video on YT and my game just crashed. Your dinos ascend to heaven or they mesh through the ground, many times I found my creatures falling through the ground in my base or after I died in a cave and went back I found them outside the map in the void. The game auto save option doesn't work in single player so combine that with the random crashes if you forget to manual save from time to time and your game crashes you lose your progress for whatever amount of time since you last saved. At the moment of writing this the ascension seems bugged too.. you don't get your beta/alpha implant or the achievements for defeating the boss on beta/alpha difficulty.",well almost 130 hour played think tell opinion game get wrong absolutely love love ark bought recommend current state bad optimization absolutely garbage trust unoptimized game history unoptimized game even decent pc still barely hit 60 70 fps place lot vegetation lot creature around attacking stuff like game drop 30 40 fps extreme case fps drop 15 20 fps bug old bug original game new one constant crash understand urgent matter devs fix trying cave killing ton creature attacking crash try fly across map dino crash literally stay one place breathing crash mostly random sometimes go hour without crash crash 5 time row trying something game paused watching video yt game crashed dinos ascend heaven mesh ground many time found creature falling ground base died cave went back found outside map void game auto save option work single player combine random crash forget manual save time time game crash lose progress whatever amount time since last saved moment writing ascension seems bugged get beta alpha implant achievement defeating bos beta alpha difficulty

899770,Last Epoch,"If you're looking through the reviews trying to find why it was review bombed, it was because at one point the devs had made the decision to not add trading after saying they would from the beginning. They had since lifted that decision. They came up with their own solution to the reason they initially said they weren't going to add it. 

You can see more on the trade news here: 
https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/trade-development-update-introducing-merchants-guild-and-circle-of-fortune-factions/51994

As for negative reviews complaining that development is slow. It's not like they're some massive triple A studio that can pump out games at will. They're just a group of remote indie devs. I rather them take this route and make sure they release a proper and polished game, instead of an unfinished mess like Wolcen.

That being said, this game is worth it. It definitely scratches that ARPG itch.

105600,Terraria,"So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: 

- This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements
- It has an incredible amount of content to it
- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)
- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy
- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight
- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)
- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! 
- Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!
- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING

Cons? Hmm.

- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!
- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.
- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.
- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. 

Other thought: 
- If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.

Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):

I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.

Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.

There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"I would give this game a 7/10 for potential. 

Pros: 
-Fun for creative types
-Decent art style
-Good concept
-Decent City Management for a Casual Player

Cons:
-Lacks Content
-Lacks AI
-Lacks Challenge
-REQUIRES Improvements

Improvements?
- Could use some cost tweaks for early game buildings, especially a Forester building. 
- Potential to add things like wizards, clerics, paladins, druids, rogues...
- Potential to add things like a sewer system beneath the city, buildings for the units above, wild game hunting for food source.
- Upgrades to existing buildings in the UI... (improved arrow turret, balista, windmills, taverns, etc. )
- Add a ""Boss"" wave of enemies and add some variance to the rate that vikings and dragons attack. (both started arriving simultaneously, and it stuck that way)
- More options for existing buildings, such as a large graveyard...  
- Castle options to simplify costs of building towers or allow for planning out walls/castle areas, new turret types, etc... 
- A non-building plotting tool for laying out where you want future buildings to go so you can plan out a city better. 

Review:
I enjoyed Kingdoms and Castles and will probably play a bit more of it to hit achievements and efficiency goals. What I found was not terrible, and in fact had some major potential. The game needs a bit of work in several departments. I think that some aspects that could add a ton of enjoyment would be things like AI scripting for your recruits, so they will actually go fight the incoming vikings. I would like to see more buildings that maybe creates a new unit type or new hero type. I was playing for years on purpose with a low population to prevent the first wave of vikings. This allowed me to build up a huge castle area before building more houses. I forced the game to delay those attacks by not building houses. After it was just wait for the waves and shoot them down whiles expanding the castle. 

I finally got to a mid-game population, and built heroes and mercs. When I placed them on the road into town, they wouldn't attack the vikings coming into the town on their own, and half the town caught on fire. The AI of your units is no-existant other than plant, harvest, repeat. There was also a lack of risk with the raids of dragons and vikings. There should be a loss of gold or other resource when they raid and pillage, but instead, they just burn stuff. The game also seems to think that a disease or food shortage is a good way to amp up the difficulty... When people got sick, the plague ended in seconds due to the hospital, but the happiness of the entire town dropped over it. My favorite was when the graneries were full to the brim, yet somehow there was a massive food shortage. This is false difficulty in game design and it is kind of bad. The developer needs to consider making a lot of the buildings capable of getting an upgrade. For example, once you build a balista, you should be able to pay to upgrade the range, damage, or add effects of it. Some quality of life improvements would go a long way. 

I'm just hoping that as they complete more of the game that the game gets fleshed out a bit more than it currently is. For that, I give the game a 7/10... if there are no further improvements, then that drops to a 5/10. Adding about twice as much would make it feel like a better game and improve the value.",would give game 7 10 potential pro fun creative type decent art style good concept decent city management casual player con lack content lack ai lack challenge requires improvement improvement could use cost tweak early game building especially forester building potential add thing like wizard cleric paladin druid rogue potential add thing like sewer system beneath city building unit wild game hunting food source upgrade existing building ui improved arrow turret balista windmill tavern etc add bos wave enemy add variance rate viking dragon attack started arriving simultaneously stuck way option existing building large graveyard castle option simplify cost building tower allow planning wall castle area new turret type etc non building plotting tool laying want future building go plan city better review enjoyed kingdom castle probably play bit hit achievement efficiency goal found terrible fact major potential game need bit work several department think aspect could add ton enjoyment would thing like ai scripting recruit actually go fight incoming viking would like see building maybe creates new unit type new hero type playing year purpose low population prevent first wave viking allowed build huge castle area building house forced game delay attack building house wait wave shoot while expanding castle finally got mid game population built hero mercs placed road town attack viking coming town half town caught fire ai unit existant plant harvest repeat also lack risk raid dragon viking loss gold resource raid pillage instead burn stuff game also seems think disease food shortage good way amp difficulty people got sick plague ended second due hospital happiness entire town dropped favorite graneries full brim yet somehow massive food shortage false difficulty game design kind bad developer need consider making lot building capable getting upgrade example build balista able pay upgrade range damage add effect quality life improvement would go long way hoping complete game game get fleshed bit currently give game 7 10 improvement drop 5 10 adding twice much would make feel like better game improve value
739630,Phasmophobia,"BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SCARY/FUNNY CO-OP GAME OUT THERE
THIS IS THE REAL SHI*

[h1] What is Phasmophobia [/h1]

• This is not a stupid jump-scare game, it's ghost investigation with 3 other people.
• It is also a great game to spook your friends or just mess with the ghost !
• The game's concept is really original and the sense of accomplishment from a mission is great.
• Complete tasks using certain equipment, find evidence,(Ghosts have certain evidences which helps us determine their type.)Use evidence to figure out which ghost it is.Talk to the ghost ?Take a picture of the ghost !
•Note down your evidences and ghost type in the journal,get into the van and leave.
• You earned money for your performance, use it to buy more and better equipment for further ghost hunts.
• You might hate horror games but you will love Phasmophobia ; ( I can't normally play horror games but this is too much fun and not that scary,because it doesn't have a Story.Most of the really really scary horror games have deep stories;Such as Outlast,Layers Of Fear,Amnesia,Alien Isolation...)


[h1] Example Scenario of a Mission [/h1]

[b]Tasks [/b]: 

• Find a room under 10 degrees celcius.(pick up thermometer and check the rooms)
• Use smudge sticks.(Ignite smudge sticks / fume sticks hold them in your hand and go around the room and spread the scent.)
• Detect ghost activity with an EMF Reader(Easiest way to do this is to anger the ghost,but usually you can get an EMF reading in the ""Ghost Room"")

[b]Info[/b]: 

• [b]Spirit Box [/b]: The ghost can hear you anytime,even if you don't use the push-to-tallk keys,the game still picks up your voice.But with the spirit box,the ghost can talk back to you !

•[b] Bone Evidence[/b] : You might find a small bone on the ground in a room.To earn any money from the bone : 
(If your hands are full drop something and pick up the Bone,it doesn't take up space in your 3-slot inventory.You can pick your dropped equipment back.)

• [b]Ghost Writing[/b] : If you find the cold room,leave a notebook on the ground and check if the ghost writes anything.If it does that's an evidence.Put it in your Journal !

• [b]Ghost Orb[/b] : It looks like a yellow flying small circle,a speckle of dust,a small firefly which can be seen in the camera-night vision.Orbs are usually in or near the ""Ghost Room""(Place a video camera in the Ghost Room and check the room from the monitor in the van)That's an evidence. Put it in your Journal !

• [b]Fingerprints [/b]: Certain ghosts leave fingerprints on the objects they interract with.
Things which the ghost can leave a fingerprint/handprint on : Doors,Light Switches,Windows,Closet Doors.

• [b]EMF Level 5[/b] :You used your EMF Scanner and found Level 5 EMF Activity.(Equip EMF Scanner and look for the Ghost's Room + You may anger the ghost by calling out his/her name also.
That's evidence. Put it in your Journal !

• [b]Freezing Tempratures[/b] : Find a temprature below 0 degrees celcius.(Check every corner of the Ghost Room and be patient after finding a room below 10 degrees.)

•[b] Extras[/b] : Sometimes,especially if the ghost likes to walk around :D,the temprature might drop down suddenly and go back up.This means that the ghost just passed through that place.You can also find readings with the EMF in places which the ghost been in before.

[b] Putting in evidences but not writing down the ""Ghost Type"" doesn't give you any reward.[/b]

• If the evidences are : EMF Level 5 + Ghost Writing + Ghost Orbs = Ghost Type (Shade) Put it in your Journal !
Congratulations ! You have completed all your tasks successfully.

[h1] Stuff You Should Do Before Starting The Game [/h1]

1 - When playing with your friends don't use any voice chat application in game.For the full Phasmophobia experience use the in game voice chat. ""V"" key for close speech - ""B"" key for long-range radio telephone. 

2 - Before you get into the building;Read the tasks,Equip your items ( You can only carry 3 items at once ) Pick them up with ""E"" and drop them with ""G""

238960,Path of Exile,"If you like action role-playing game (ARPG) but have not played this game yet, you must. Grinding Gear Games, an indie gaming company with their entirely free-to-play game, have created one of the most complex, in-depth and innovative ARPG in the gaming industry.

[h1]Business Model[/h1]
First of all, this game has one of the most fair and ethical business model you could ever see in the free-to-play market. Absolutely nothing you can get with real money gives you advantage over other players. This encourage players to support the game because they actually want to donate for the developing and its developers and not because they are forced to progress.

[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]
The developers have stated that they ""are sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoonish RPGs. The art style [they] chose for [i]Path of Exile[/i] is dark, gritty and realistic"". The graphics are beautifully detailed, the music is iconig and the voice acting is outstanding.

[h1]Gameplay & Mechanics[/h1]
The customization and character progression in [i]Path of Exile[/i] is complex and impressively in-depth, with a vast diversity in their mechanics.

[b]Classes[/b]
Each one of the 7 classes starts at different location of a passive skill tree, composed by 1325 nodes, with non-linear progression (the tree is actually a web).

[b]Items & Gears[/b]
Set items is a horrible decision for builds diversity, so this is not what you will find here. Of course there are Unique items, but having a full set of Uniques of the same theme/type does not grant you bonus mods. This is meant to be this way to avoid forcing players to play with sets, breaking their character building freedom.

The item drops: maps, divination cards, jewels, gear items (their category, rarity, mods, gem sockets and links), are randomly generated.

[b]Jewels[/b]
There are socketable nodes in the Passive Skill Tree that makes possible to socket Jewels that grants bonus and special attributes to your skill tree. These jewels have rarity, mods and can be crafted too.

[b]Skills[/b]
The skill system made by gems makes possible that the characters are not limitative to a few skills, so the game does not dictate how the player is going to play. These gems have level and attribute requirements according to their color (Strength, red; Dexterity, green; Intelligence, blue), they can be leveled up, have quality % and can be corrupted for bonus mods.

[b]Divination Cards[/b]
This kind of items are collectibles that gives you a specific item once you have gather enough cards of a set. Each card is dropped in a specific areas of the map. This system allow players to systematically work their way to the acquisition of the items they want, without having to rely on an eternal grinding.

[b]Maps[/b]
Their structures and pack of monsters are randomly generated, and is the main focus of the end-game, since they can be crafted.

[b]Currency & Crafting[/b]
There is no gold in [i]Path of Exile[/i], there are 25 currency items (orbs) that have crafting functionality. They can add/remove/re-roll the mods of the items, modify the sockets (number, colors and links) of the gear items, they can corrupt the items, change their rarity, etc. Basically people trade items for items they are going to use, and not for gold. This makes the trade highly in-depth and open.

[b]Forsaken Masters[/b]
There are 6 Masters (NPCs). Each one of them can be leveled up to level 8 by doing daily missions, and they offer crafting bench and hideouts that can be decorated and customized as the player wish.

The variety of builds and the hideout customization is so open that the developers runs two series called Build of the Week and Hideout of the Week.

[h1]Developers & Support[/h1]
The developers work along side with the community to improve the game and add new content. They do a great job balancing the game and deploying constant patches and updates. The support is surprisingly responsive and open to any kind of feedback.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
All these elements makes the different ways a character may progress literally infinite, and the game always encourage to make new builds and try different mechanics. Some players likes to experiment with builds and other players likes to break the ""rules"" and metas to come with insane mechanics. The developers are, as explained, the most ethical and responsive gaming company you could find out there considering the success of their game.

I was wrong as poultry with dentures!!

in-depth doesn't even start to describe it, the gameplay might scare you away but it's efficient once you grasp the goals at hand. just act with your best judgment

first game in a year:

- me and a friend meet up near muldraugh, when I get there he tells me he's got attacked, he's wounded.

- fleeing the undead, he got lost and bumped into an abbandoned lumber mill with solid metal doors.

- he gives me directions. I see where he is.
 while I struggle to get drugs, bandages and disinfectant, he discovers the joys of stitching oneself.

- we join and, while he recovers from his wounds, I board the place up and gather all the wood and tools I can.
 we sleep in the break room. they're 5 feets away, clawing at the boards. they never break in.

- after a few days we start scavenging the suburbs, just what we need, we have projects.

- a few weeks later, we're settled, the crops we planted on the roof after transporting some dirt there is flourishing.
 days passed by, peacefully. the place is clear and we start to feel in control.
 he picks up cooking.

- one night, I hear moans and cracks, the building's on fire. whole groups of them came to see it.
 my friend passed out while cooking and canning food for the winter.

- he almost dies in the fire to save the seeds and tools we couldn't survive without.

- once set up in a smaller building, we heal and consume all our reserves, the meds are gone and the water shuts off.
 we peek outside.

- the Z's have massed, we can't reclaim enough terrain for a field or rain collectors.
 after making an inventory of what's left we decide to loot the gun store, one town away.
 we'll have to get out anyway and at least, if we go there, we could clean our home afterwards.

- the way there is easy, we're well rested, fed and hydrated.
 we run there, only stopping for the night in a gas station half way

- just before we arrive, we're starving. we ate all our food, drank all our water.... we see a supermarket!

- we drink soda and eat meat for the first time in a month. we're safe in the offices, the stairs are broken.
 we can rest peacefully and the shop is within a stone throw.

-the next morning we silently climb down the roof with a rope made of bloody clothes.

- the score is easy. I distract them, shooting our few last bullets and run into the woods while he brings down the metal roll-up door of the gunshop as fast as he can with a sledgehammer.

- we've got 'em! we're armed to the teeth and we paint our way out of town red.

- I already aim better by the time we reach the gas station.
 it's a tough fight to reclaim it and I get scrached. a cold gives me fever and I freak out at the idea I might be infected.
 I drink and smoke all night to forget the worries.

- by the morning I'm all better (besides the hangover but who cares, I live!) but my friend is nauseous.
 he didn't rest and looks sickly. he tells me he thought we were above use-by dates.
 after surviving what we did. he couldn't just die from bad cabbage... could he?

- a few miles later, he can't run anymore. I run my lungs out, straight to the city.
 he'll die if I can't get him supplies.

- before he stops answering he says this: 
 ""I can't run anymore. I'm exhausted, sick, wounded. they'll catch me soon""
 I have to go back.

- I put the gun bags down, raid the first house I find for basic pharmacy goods and just run his way.

- I battled to find his bright orange shirt in what's left of his last stand and found him. 
 brought him peace, losing some flesh on the way.

-I was now the one wounded, exhausted, sick and lost.

 alone on a country road with a dead friend, his murderers and three sports bags full of guns and bullets...

686810,Hell Let Loose,"Team17's inherent ineptitude and complete lack of a stakeholder engagement strategy is on full display following U14. As a community owner and server provider, I am extremely disappointed with the level of communication we've had through official channels both prior to game updates/patches, and afterwards when we've encountered issues. 

Communities such as mine form the backbone of the broader Hell Let Loose community. We host 6 servers across three regions ($780 AUD/month), attract and retain new players, promote the game to our broader audience, and contribute to the game's social fabric. To say I am disappointed that I cannot elicit answers from Team17 on the most basic hosting questions is an understatement. 

The lack of a PTE (or anything outside of developer QA) prior to the latest updates is nonsensical, and it really shows in U14. Other reviews have articulated the myriad of bugs better than I can, but needless to say, the amount and severity of the bugs is unacceptable for an established $70 game made by a large studio. The QA processes need an overhaul, and desperately needs broader community involvement.

1063730,New World,"After 1k hours on live and open beta I decided to quit. On the new world forums website I made a post about my reasons for quitting, and included in that post was fair criticism. The post gained significant traction with 2.5k views and over hundreds of comments. A day later my post was remove and my account was suspended because I ""no longer am an active player"" (referring to me mentioning im quitting). This is a rather obvious attempt at censoring what was a popular thread containing discussion about the frankly atrocious state of the game. I went to reddit to post about my ban and obvious attempt at censorship, that post was taken down within seconds. I made a 2nd forums account and included in a new post screen shots of both the reddit post being taken down and my initial forum account being suspended. My 2nd account forum was then suspended a 10 minutes after making the new post which was a PSA for the policing and censorship going on. In that post I asked people to screen shot the post so that in case i was censored again, there was proof to share and raise the alarms. 

This game is in an atrocious state, and the developers dont care to communicate. You can watch a youtube video from any reputable content creator and they will highlight the state of the game in a better way than I could here in a steam review. What I can tell you, is that the Officials, developers, community managers on forums, don't care about you. They have shady business ethic and are looking to actively silence fair criticism of the game.

1336490,Against the Storm,"(Played this on Epic for a year)

Do you ever think to yourself ""dang, I'd love to play a game of Civ 6 right now"", and then you do. But once you're getting further into the game you're like ""man, I'm kinda done, that's not what I was looking for"", or you just dread the upcoming length of the game.

Or you think to yourself ""Northgard sounds good right now"" but then the fighting comes and you're like ""urgh , let me build in peace"".

Simply put, you love base building, but only the early stages? Do you have attention issues? Look no further, I present to you:

Against the Storm A roguelite city builder!

""But Chris, how does that work!?"" Well, you see, you live in the Smoldering City, and the queen tasked you with establishing settlements, these settlements, once done, give you meta-progression resources, that allow you to upgrade your main city. Every so often, after a few settlements, a storm comes in and wipes the map. You have to start again. But with the upgrades, you'll be able to be more efficient at base building, you'll have more options, you'll be able to build further, which will give you access to rarer resources, which in turn will allow you to unlock better meta upgrades!

Maps are randomly generated, with different difficulties, and modifiers. There are glades in the fog of war, those glades sometimes have resources, sometimes dangers (which when resolved give you stuff for your current settlement), sometimes both! The queen also gives you objectives while you're playing, which are ever changing. When completed, they give you reputation. Reputation unlocks blueprints, which will give you access to new buildings. You also have ""cornerstones"" which are permanents passive buffs for your settlement.

That's right! Not every building is always unlocked, you gotta choose your path, no two games are the same.

This game takes inspiration from several other games, but it's also its own thing.

- This Game Monetises EVERYTHING it is extremly P2W don't believe the people who play who justify it as a company needing to make money.
- P2W Components= As Examples.
- You need Pets to loot for you and keep up your grind pace.
- You use up a limited amount of contribution to expand your worker network and storage meaning CASH SHOP to increase without contribution. This means you can have more workers, more nodes without the encumbarance on your contribution amount.
- Enhancing Gear lowers durability you will want to use Cash Shop Artisan Memories to repair when your durability goes down due to enhancement failures. This reduces your repair costs by 4x and with Boss gear we are talking millions - billions in repair costs.
- Easy mode to get TET gear; Buy Costumes on the Cash Shop and burn them for Cron Stones to ensure enhancement failures don't de-rank your gear.
- Costumes, Pet Costumes, EXP Scrolls, Inventory Scrolls, Weight Limit Increases. There is no limit to the amount of money you can spend in this game for improvements that are so vast it is P2W. Ex. Increase your weight you can grind longer, fish longer, without having to go back and forth. Silver in this game = power the more efficient you are the more power you have access to. People will say this is pay for convenience but when we are talking about  4 - 100x more efficiency I think you can realize for yourself that you won't ever keep up with players for free.
- This game is expensive and you will always find yourself in need of something from the cash shop.

Enhancing in this game sucks and you have to enhance pretty much everything so be ready to deal with failures and RNG expenses, spend hours faming materials and building fail stacks so you can eventually succeed.

294100,RimWorld,"My entire colony was saved by a tortoise.

This won't be a review like the ones I normally do, going over the pros and cons. Rimworld's a story generator, so I thought I'd share my story. I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing this, and set up a small colony. The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoise, who I named ""Old Timer."" We set up a small farm, and once we found a female tortoise (who I named ""Henrietta Peach""), they had kids. And their kids had kids. Soon enough, I had too many tortoises than I knew what to do with, so i tried selling them, and the nearby colonists loved them. But things took a darker turn.

Around 5 days after buying rimworld, my IRL dog, of 15 years, passed. It was sad, but what hit extra hard was old timer's death only a few hours later. Both were blind, both had bad backs - it hurt, and I cried. I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timer, and laid him to rest in it. But this is not where his story ends.

A few ingame hours later, I got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward. In that moment, I knew what I had to do, as the end goal of my playthrough.

I couldn't save my dog from old age, but I sure as could save this turtle. Old timer was going to space.

After quickly gunning down some tribals and getting the serum, I needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship. Luckily, an ancient ruin was on my map, and after an intense fight with some killer robots, I safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guarding.

Not much happened relating to him. Henrietta died of old age herself, and over the four or so years it took me to complete the ship, old timer's children numbered over 500. i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ship's supplies, like plasteel and uranium, and at long last, I placed old timer in the now-finished ship and turned the reactor on.

When you power on the escape reactor, rimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense game, with a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged. This wasn't a big deal - I had troops in power armor with miniguns, and we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths. Right as the reactor was at full power, and I told my colonists to enter the ship, things took a dramatic turn. A solar flare knocked out all my defences, leaving me without any kind of fire support. I hurredly got my colonists in the ship, but right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to it...

Pirates airdropped into my base. I was screwed.

I was about to launch without him, when salvation came in a way I hadn't expected: A tortoise (number 493, to be precise) didn't take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepers, and bit a pirate enforcer on the leg. This caused the pirate to hit him with his club, and after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the base, who promptly attacked back. And, in the ensuing chaos, my last colonist boarded the ship and we escaped.

Old timer, a blind, crippled, undead tortoise repaid me for saving his life - by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escape, but who also protected me in my darkest hour of need. This game is a gift, and I cannot reccommend it enough. Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you want, it's still a story worth telling.

10/10: The first game to make me cry.

108600,Project Zomboid,"Alright, its time for the review. What is Project Zomboid? Is it a mix of Runescape and the Sims with a dash of zombie apocalypse?  Is it Day Z mixed with Stardew Valley where every neighbor is trying to marry their teeth into your jugular? I'm glad to report that its all of these things. With the inclusion of Project Zomboid's most recent Build 41.60 Experimental Multiplayer update, the game has taken the formula, and cranked it up to 11. 11,000. I have spent 1430 hours in Singleplayer, visiting each spot in this massive recreation of KY, learning, dying, and repeating, each time coming closer to the question the devs originally sought to answer, ""Would you survive in a zombie apocalypse?"" The answer turns out to be a resounding no. Every run cut short by careless mistakes, overconfidence, and lack of preparation. This games mechanics run deep, and if you adopt the mindset of ""can I do this in real life?"" You'll begin to do well in KY's abusive apocalypse landscape. Lets look at some of my favorite aspects:

- Sandbox settings.
You can alter every facet of the game world, from the day you start on (full 365 days a year to choose from, 4 seasons), the type of zombies and how many of them you want in your nightmare scenario, how much loot spawns, the chance the house you're looting is locked, if it has a house alarm, if it is a special loot house. It's all here and what I mentioned isn't even a fraction of the settings you can change. 

-Kentucky.
The map in this game is based loosely on the real world locations of various towns and cities of Kentucky. The games map has never felt this complete with 41.60. Louisville has been inserted into the world and boy, is it MASSIVE. Louisville truly feels like endgame content, as my group of 5 fought their way into the exclusion zone in the middle of a thunderstorm, guns blazing and only half of us made it into the center of the city and we lost our supplies to the horde. Every run feels fresh because of the versatility of the map. You can plan, build, farm, craft, camp, fish, forage, cook, become a car mechanic, Rambo your way down Muldraugh's strip, and create your ultimate scenario no matter where you end up. 

-Mods
Speaking with some mod developers and first hand creating my own mod with the help of the community, I can say that making mods in this game is fairly easy. Not to say that making a complicated mod is easy, and you can see with Autotsars mods, KI5's, iBrRus, Blackbeard, Azakaela and many other creators I haven't mentioned, are a staple to the community and Project Zomboid would not be the same without them. The list of content creators for this game is large and I expect to only increase as this game becomes more popular. Seriously, play this game vanilla, then try out some mods to add to the immersion of the game, you won't regret it.

-MULTIPLAYER
Finally. The big one. The multiplayer of Project Zomboid is not necessarily new, but it is a new inclusion of build 41.60. If you haven't enrolled in Build 41 already, then we are not playing the same game. The features this build brings far outweigh any reason to play the stable branch anymore. I played 12 hours of MP recently and DAMN. Just DAMN. Our first group of 12 tore through West Point, created a base on the outskirts of town, prepped for a journey to Louisville, and got slaughtered in Valley Station. We raided hardware stores, supermarkets, bookstores, shooting ranges, and car lots. Making the final push to greatness is without a doubt, far more enjoyable with friends. Hell, I never even met my group before we started, but we all became friends by the end of our survival. Most mods work with MP and while PvP and a few desync issues need to be ironed out, the potential Multiplayer brings to the game and its roleplaying implications will be quintessential to the success of itself in the coming years.

-Cons
+ Here is where I lay out some of the problems I have with the game. But if you have already seen how many hours I've played, you know this list is short enough. The development progress in this game is slow. The team behind it is small, but growing every year. The devs truly care, but they also do not care to release content before they think it is ready. That means waiting months for updates, and often a year for bigger updates. Luckily, the dev team has been transparent about the development with the community and there's a biweekly newsletter that lets everyone know what they're up to. If you want constant updates that bring fresh content to the game every week, this game may not be for you. If you like watching a game bloom from inception and grow into something special, this game is right up your alley. In the meantime, the community has mods for your every whim, so it's never been a huge issue for me. It's modding scene is beginning to rival Skyrim's or Minecraft's. 

+ The bugs in this game have been consistent for a while. While every update seems to squash a few dozen, a handful pop up from time to time, including zombies that flip on the ground, lag when driving fast vehicles and audio related bugs, missing or broken textures. Nothing that has ever been game breaking, but unfortunately, were immersion breaking. The devs have trackers and generally respond well to issues the community has, but again, you may have to wait a while until your specific issue may get fixed. 

+Vanilla content/Feature creep. When comparing my vanilla games to my modded games, the modded games always are superior. Some mods I can't imagine playing without now. The devs have done a great job setting up the foundation of the game, it now just needs some polish in some areas. Vanilla guns need more variety. The selection is weak and pistols, shotguns, and rifles are all fine in the beginning, but can become a detriment when facing hordes in the late game. The game does not include enough full auto weapons to handle these scenarios efficiently, but mods once again solve this issue. Throwing grenades and molotovs in this game is also absolute trash. These systems haven't been touched in ages, and with more content to soon follow, one wonders if the devs will ever revisit these sections again... Blacksmithing is mentioned in the game files, but has not been implemented yet. Car armor has yet to be implemented as well, and all of these things I'm mentioning ask the question, have the devs extended too far? I guess we will find out.

+Hardware specs. As the game begins to mature and add more features, lower spec machines are being left behind. You may begin to experience lag if you fall below the recommended specs and it doesn't look like that trend will change anytime soon. There are enough options to keep the FPS high, but I feel soon that wont be enough. If you are lower spec, I would try out the free demo in the Steam store to figure out if this game is right for you.

Final thoughts/ TL:DR:
If you didn't read any of that, then you don't need me to convince you. Buy this game. Its 14.99. That's the price of a craft beer 6 pack. This is the best RPG I have EVER played and my most played game time.

The ""much improved"" traffic AI they claimed would eliminate the first game's traffic problems? It just makes cars teleport to their destination if they're being too slow.

These are a just a few examples, but every single thing they claim is being simulated, isn't. It's all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection.

892970,Valheim,"[h1] Odin won't let me go outside anymore and I have Stockholm Syndrome [/h1]


Early in the year 2021, I heard about this game a decent amount of people were talking about: ""Valheim""

It appeared to be some sort of Survival Craft / Sandbox title taking place in a Norse mythology setting, and since I love both, I thought to myself: ""Hey, let's give this a try!""

Several months later, I'm unable to tell if that grunt I just heard came from some creature in the game or my own stomach because of the pasta I ate raw in order to minimize the time spent on something else than building, slaying monsters and gathering materials.
Social interactions are a distant memory, time is irrelevant and I could swear the other day my cat attempted to speak norwegian while sporting a fake beard in order to try and get my attention.

Now allow me to at least try to explain to you why you should drop everything and make Valheim your new and only religion:


[b] -The game's not good; it's [u] amazing [/u]. [/b]

At the time I'm writing this, [i] Valheim [/i] is still in early access. This is something I genuinely have to regularly remind myself because so far, it actually feels like a finished product.

In my 900+ hours of play time ( [strike] shut up [/strike] ), I could count on a single hand's digits the times I've run into bugs, and all of them were minor things that a simple log out/ log back in immediately fixed, with no consequence whatsoever.

From gameplay to graphics, every aspect of the game is so polished that when you take into consideration the fact that this is a work in progress made by a small team of indie developpers, it's enough to put some of the biggest names in the industry through such amounts of shame that they'd wish they were Activision Blizzard right now.


[b] -Ok, but what is this game about? [/b]

Basically, [i] Valheim [/i] is some sort of cross between Survival Craft, Adventure and Sandbox set in an open world.

The (pretty huge) map is comprised of several different biomes you'll have to explore in order to find crafting and building materials, fight monsters and eventually face bosses. It is procedurally generated at world creation, which means that no two maps will look the same, thus contributing to a unique experience.

Progression is based on the improvement of your gear through crafting, which requires materials you'll get from various sources in the world; some of which you'll only have access to after defeating bosses.
Recipes are unlocked either by putting said materials into your inventory or interacting with crafting stations for the first time. This means that if you join a world in which the other players have already defeated bosses and stored materials, breaking into their homes and rummaging through the crap they've been hoarding like a real Viking should allow you to catch up on their progression without having to do the exploring and fighting yourself (and possibly ruin your experience in the process, as well as earning yourself the title of Lazy Bastard).

To help you achieve your goals, you have a system of ""skills"" which are improved through pure practice. For example, the more you sprint, the higher your sprinting skill value gets, which progressively allows you to sprint for longer while using less stamina.
In other words: practice leads to efficiency.


[b] -Sounds nice, but what's so special about it? [/b]

If you've played other Open World Survival Craft games before, like [i] Ark: Survival Evolved [/i] or [i] Conan Exiles [/i] (which are pretty damn good in their own right), you might notice some similarities with Valheim in terms of mechanics and gameplay.
What [i] Valheim [/i] does that others don't in that regard, is either improving on or getting rid of these elements that happen to mostly cause rectal discomfort in other games from the genre.

Ever spent four hours farming the stone required to build the three missing walls from your crappy shack in hope of preventing your untimely death from pneumonia caused by a sudden summer breeze, only to be on your way home and suddenly die of dehydration because more than three minutes have passed since the last time you drank?
And then you spent two more hours just running to your corpse on the other side of the continent, dying 475 more times in the process because some local flock of seagulls have deemed you the perfect sacrifice to their dark god?
But when you finally managed to reach the location of your body, you only found undisturbed dust and sand as even the scorching sun seemed to laugh at your absolute despair?

No such tragedy in [i] Valheim [/i].

Although you can -and will- die in the welcoming embrace of your friendly neighborhood wildlife, the game is designed in such a way that most of the frustration you'll experience could only be blamed on your own lack of foresight.

Examples of this would be the following:

- [u] You cannot die of hunger or thirst, although eating is necessary to increase your health and stamina in order to survive encounters with monsters or sudden falls from steep cliffs [/u]

- [u] The amounts of materials required for crafting and building can be gathered without necessiting to quit your job and survive on potatoes bought on the internet with healthcare money [/u]

- [u] Weather only affects your health and stamina regeneration rate (except if you plan on climbing snow-covered mountains in your birthday suit, but I'm no one to judge, we've all tried this IRL at least once) [/u]

- [u] Player corpses have no time limit and will never disappear, even after a server restart [/u]

- [u] As long as there's four walls and a roof around them, beds can be placed anywhere and the last one you interacted with will act as your next respawn location until you manually disable it [/u]

Now don't get me wrong: the game absolutely does not lack anything in terms of challenge, and at times you may potentially suffer flashbacks from that time you tried [i] Dark Souls [/i] while drunk with your neighbors' newborn baby howling like a tasmanyan devil in the background.


[b] -Have you considered seeing a therapist? [/b]

Don't need to; don't want to.

Plus I don't have to do anything you tell me to since you're not even my real mom.


[b] -Sounds a bit too perfect, there must be at least some downsides [/b]

There are, but as surprising or dubious as it may seem, there aren't many in my humble opinion:

- [u] Technical optimisation isn't the best as of yet. I'm more specifically thinking about the fact that being in an area with several player-made structures can cause severe framerate drops, even on decent computers. This can go to the point of unplayable on lower-end computers, as it happened to one of my chums who eventually stopped playing for now because of it.
Hopefully it will be fixed with an upcoming update. [/u]

- [u] The damage dealt to structures by some higher-tier creatures just feels like the equivalent of card castles in a room full of chimps with ADHD. [/u]

- [strike] (Used to rant about auto-pickup here, turns out I'm just blind) [/strike]

Keep in mind, however, that the game is still in early access at the time I'm posting this review.


[b] -Final words [/b]

Somewhere in-between thrilling and relaxing, [i] Valheim [/i] is a very well-balanced game made with love and passion, and it really shows.
The ability to alter the terrain by digging / flattening / raising the ground is pretty dope.

Regardless of what you think about the retro-ish style of the graphics, this game is [u] gorgeous [/u]. You'll know what I mean.

From the very first time I got ganged up on by a group of monsters while peacefully picking berries, to when I took a sip of mead as I watched the horizon from the top of my fortress decorated with the heads of their brethren, I enjoyed every second of this journey I'm still far from being done with.

If you are tempted, just buy the game; I promise you won't regret it.

1286830,STAR WARS™: The Old Republic™,"One day when I was a child, I received a random copy of Star Wars Insider magazine.  On the front cover was a Jedi staring determinedly ahead, a green lightsaber ignited in one hand, her other palm stretching outward, breaking free from chains around her arms and neck.  Emblazoned across the image were the words ""The Old Republic"".

Something about that image captured my imagination, and has never quite let go.

Every day after school was finished I would log onto swtor.com and watch through the marvellous catalogue of videos there.  I couldn't wait to see what new material awaited me as I logged in.  Perhaps it was another instalment in the ongoing history of the galaxy as narrated by Jedi Master Gnost-Dural, who hoped the uncover the origins of the Sith and forge a pathway for peace by looking to the past.  Maybe it was another developer dispatch, where you could hear excited employees talk passionately about what they were working on - a writer discussing ever branching character paths, a concept artist creating the design language for a new faction, a composer crafting the soundscape for a strange new world...

By the time the game was finally released, I had already fallen completely in love with it, and to my great satisfaction and lasting joy, the game deserved every bit of that love.  Even now, some 12 years later, the original 8 class stories constitute hundreds of hours of pure Star Wars delight.  Every planet is oozing (sometimes quite literally) with atmosphere, every companion is wonderfully fleshed out, every class is satisfying to learn, and every story is a little slice of Star Wars distilled into its essence and served to you on a silver platter.  And that's just the base game!  A decade of DLC and new material has been added to the game, and it's horizons have been pushed ever onward.

Of course, over the years my interest in the game has waxed and waned.  It's has its share of issues - it's far from a perfect game, and there's plenty within it worthy of criticism and improvement.  But the truth is that in spite of everything, I still love this game.  It captured a little bit of magic for me as a child, and somehow that bit of magic always seems to be waiting there for me when I come back.  4000 hours is quite a bit of time.  5 months, 3 weeks and 6 days - that or thereabouts.  Quite a bit of time for me to sum up my experience of.

One day, eventually, the game will come to an end, as all things do.  When that time comes I'll be able to look back over all those hours spent on my ship with Kira, Scourge and Doc, with Mako, Torian, Gault and Blizz, hours spent battling the evils of the Empire with my Jedi Knight, raising Cain as my bounty hunter, and talking my way out of trouble with my smuggler, hours spent raiding the palace of the dread masters with friends, duelling it out in the sand dunes of Tatooine, endlessly rearranging my strongholds, and exploring the galaxy from the Core Worlds to the edge of the Unknown Regions.

And so, when I look back on all those hours spent and all those cherished memories, I know I wouldn't have it any other way.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!",disclaimer survivor main play game fun competition dbd community really get get bad killer face camp oh well die move next game get good killer find immediately hook bc juke whoop patrol camp 100 ok biggie next game please think lot community salt killer come dealing rank one survivor actually play game properly run around flash killer face legitimate strategy take away fun game opinion killer horrible one also called name survivor tell get gud older player ruin newer player player put 1000 hour relax fun game pip always next game said game crazy fun let saltiness community keep buying game grab fun ignore anyone might give hard time fixate much ranking process unless absurdly highly competitive reason also fine try let push spout anger even recognize jerk play game like game fun compete

1245620,ELDEN RING,"[h1]Honest Review from an Old Codger[/h1]

[b]First impressions and on the fence: [/b]

I am an older gamer and a father of 4 boys. Elden Ring was the first game for me in the ""Souls-Series"" that I have really played. I did buy Dark Souls 3 and try to play that once it released on Steam, and it took me nearly 3 hours to kill Gundyr; only to find myself constantly invaded, and relentlessly killed when I was trying to play with my youngest son, Griffin afterwards. Needlessly to say, I quickly put that game down and moved on with my life. Years later, my sons showed me Elden Ring and I fell in love with the trailer. My wife encouraged me to try it and be open; maybe this would be a better experience. Time would tell. My gamers of all age and creed, I have put in 1000 hours in and I have no intentions of stopping. 

 I told myself that I would give an honest review from my point of view if I ever played the game for 1000 hours.

[b]Arising as a Tarnished: [/b]

I can safely say that this game is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life; I have played many. I have experienced such a range of emotions of this game, and no matter how many times I failed at a boss or a mechanic, I always knew that I could better myself if I applied myself; a nice lesson learned in life that transcends quite well into the gaming universes. Once I was able to get my noodle around the mechanics of this game, I fell in love and I could not put it down; I still cannot. You just have to be patient with yourself and believe in yourself. That is one of the many cornerstones of life that leads to success and in these Souls games, it is no different. You can quite literally play the game however you want. Any build you can think of, any style you desire, you can do it here.  Your limits are only set on your imagination and will power.  I have created many different kinds of builds for my complete playthroughs and I never get bored beating the games and repeating the content as a different character from the hit MOBA: League of Legends. 

[b]Support beyond the Fog[/b]:

As an older gamer, and father of 4 boys, my time is limited, and it is always an opportunity cost when learning how to play a new game. The community that surrounds Elden Ring are amazing as well, which was very strange at first. I did not expect a game, that is heavily singleplayer, to have an immense amount of care, and support from a community. From this community, the amount of resources of knowledge and guidance they give, often reminds me of my first time playing Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest and the original World of Warcraft.  From wikis to video playthroughs, and everything in between, anything you could possibly want to know, and answers to the questions that you did not think you could have, the community has your back. Keep this in mind if you are ever stuck in this game, or on the fence about this game. The resources are there for you, the support from the community is there for you both in and out of game.

[b]A Seamless Land, that is as vast as the oceans[/b]

When I reached the 25 hours mark, I told my wife that this game reminded me a lot of Nintendo's 1998 hit classic ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"". That world space was so vast for its time, it was like nothing that the world of gaming has ever seen before.  Seamlessly wondering around, adventuring around, didn't matter if you got lost or hit a dead end, I was so engaged back then to explore and find what wonders and secrets held, low and behold, Elden Ring delivered that same experience that I had in my youth. That was so captivating for me and it really left an impression on me of what it means to explore in a game and actually enjoy yourself. It has been literally decades since any game has been able to deliver that experience again and trust me, I have bought nearly all those AAA open world games that have sucked in comparison on delivering a wholesome experience. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

When I buy a game, I invest my hard earned money AND my limited time in it. I expect to have a good time with my family and friends that also play that game. I took a leap of faith with this game; especially after my first experience with a FROMSOFT game was quite miserable (LOL not anymore, I have nearly 100% Darksouls III and absolutely love the Dark Souls games, yes including DS II). Needless to say, this game has not only surpassed my expectations, but it has been quite sometime (I would say 5 years) that I have thoroughly enjoyed myself playing a game. Gamer-Rot is a hard experience to endure and live through as a passionate gamer, and Elden Ring got me out of it. Elden Ring has paved the road for me and my sons to spend more quality time together. Thank you Elden Ring.

386360,SMITE®,"A game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company.  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago.  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant here, to be honest. Oh, and a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyance.

[b]God Design[/b]
I have been an active player of this game for about 5 years, (Athena's release).  As a reference, this is about midway through beta.  I've got 2440H and 55M, so almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam.  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less.  During beta, and early season 1 + 2, there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch.  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything that's come out during the past year or so, (I will admit, I do love Cerberus.)  But when you compare gods like Chernobog, Achilles, Hachiman, and Thoth to gods like Tyr, Ah Muzen Cab, Janus, and Scylla, you can just tell there really isn't much actualy originality being dumped into these kits.  They may have one mechanic that is new and exciting, but other than that, its just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh.  (It isn't)

[b]Chests[/b]
Now you've got the community wide absolutely hated chest mechanic.  Originally when chests came out, they were all right.  There was a chest with approx 55 items in it, including voice packs, higher tier skins.  It was pretty cool.  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin.  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearance, but they had nice little gimmicks.  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules model's tiny head and took it further, giving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack.  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on.  These two skins were not exactly incredible, but they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the (much smaller) cosmetic inventory.  Now, every single patch that comes out, there is a new chest (Sometimes even three), slapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldn't be in the game either.  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released.  Everything was a gamble.  And that is bullshit.  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crap, 

[b]Community Relations[/b]
Last year Hi-rez also had many of their employees be let go, quit, or fired.  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well known, well liked asset of the community.  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that don't seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community.  SNK8Four is my prime example.  This man was absolutely adored by the community, the pro scene, and pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days.  He was very much the face for many people that began early.  Then just one day, he's gone.  (To be fair, Hi-Rez no longer deserves him.)  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective.  The new character design lead is just full of shit, the new artwork / effect guy (HiRezChuck or some shit) is just a flat disppointment with everything, (WE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS). Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has had, especially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skulls, and now they are just fucking everywhere.  Its edgy and annoying.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]
Here's one that was brought up in the comments, and should rightfully be added.  I guess I'm just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing.  The matchmaking in this game, is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  The queues are diluted because there are so many.

Here is a list of all game modes and a short description
[i]Conquest[/i] - The tried and true three lanes and jungle MOBA format.
[i]Siege[/i] - Two lane smaller map, with 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing.  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquest.
[i]Arena[/i] - 5v5 Death match, minimal wave farming.  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other.  This is the game that is ranked as the most popular.
[i]Clash[/i] - Also kind of a mini conquest, however its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungle, as the lanes are closer together.  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective boss.
[i]Joust[i/] - 3v3 Single lane, small side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion.  Also a more popular game mode than Conquest.
[i]Duel[/i] - 1v1 Joust on same map.  Ranked only
[i]Assault[/i] - All random gods 5v5 one lane.  No backing until death.
[i]Mode of the day[/i] - Random garbage that cycles through every day.  (All same god no cooldowns etc)

EDITED 
Smite has shifted to a timed queue system, so now you only sit for 3mins at a time for casual conquest.  Matchmaking still seems pretty random skill wise.

[b]God balance[/b]
This is Hirez's biggest problem, in my opinion.  I get the skins in chests thing.  I get the god design thing.  I get the business/employee thing.  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each other, is it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect?  New gods are horribly bloated, every ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten ""This ability will hurt people in front of you"" mechanic.  Old gods are left to rot, unless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kit, buffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtuned, of which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more.  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect.  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came out, (Buy all the items throughout a time period = approx 140$USD), Ullr managed to sit at 100% P/B rate for Months.  MONTHS.  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustment, but it was incredibly shallow and obvious.  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirable, he was hit with multiple nerfs, bringing him in line. When a new god is released, there are two possible scenarios.   

Scenario 1) This god is unstoppable.  He can do everything by himself, requires no assistance, and will absolutely make everyone else have 0 fun, if the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this god.

Scenario 2) This god is absolutely horrible.  The kit is just a mishmash of clashing abilities which in no way shape or form synergize together and will just serve as three random situational abilities with an ult that hopefully does something, (Looking at you Chernobog).  


This game is a huge part of my life, and I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the years, including a +1500$ to the world championships in January of 2015.  (EDIT - I forgot I also attended in 2016)

But, it is also a huge regret and a downward slope.  HiRez needs to get their shit together, because this game could easily be so incredible, but they refuse to take the proper steps.",game absolutely deathgrip bad decision driven company game longer

899770,Last Epoch,"I recommend the game to any ARPG fan, but it's a ""mild"" recommendation for now. The game has a lot in it, and definitely worth playing, but as I reached the endgame, some things started to bother me more and more. Below, I'll talk about three biggest issues I have with the game, but please keep in mind, as an Early Access game, things might change; I hope they'll change. 

[h1]Map Variety[/h1]
Last Epoch has no procedural map generation. In the endgame, the ""Monolith""s you choose will often feature the same subset of maps, along with same subset of enemy archetypes. You'll face similar enemies on the same maps over and over in other words. Sometimes, you get to play on the same map that you've just finished. 

In my opinion, in ARPGs, a map is a canvas, and having a different canvas' each time keeps things fresh by putting you under an illusion that keeps your mind away from the idea of you doing a repetitive task over and over. This is certainly not the case in this game. 

A proper procedural map generation is urgently needed in short. Without it, I get burnt out rather fast, and it could be the same case for you as well. Other aspects of the game has been keeping me from feeling the burnout so far, but I'm afraid I'll buckle before reaching 100+ hours just because of this reason alone. I've started making other characters to keep myself interested further.

[h1]Endgame: Monoliths, Echoes[/h1]
I like the base endgame, you select a monolith (storyline) that is available to you, and essentially design your own maps as you progress through echoes (maps). After each echo, you are given two options to pick from, which adds a modifier to the enemies, and may last a few echoes, stacking the difficulty up. I really like it. However...

At the end of the monoliths, you get to choose one blessing among three, and these blessings are drawn from their own pool, and has a power rating attached to them. They could be simple drop rate boosts, to a vital stat improvements that'll enhance your build. You need to complete 3 quest echoes, and while the first few monoliths are easy, the later ones require you to maybe go through 30 echoes in order to finish a monolith, or even more as encountering a quest echo is chance based.

The problem with this is, if you were after these blessings, you only get a chance after a long patience, and are at the mercy of the RNGesus to get a blessing you want with a good roll. If we could improve our blessings somehow; like incrementally raising their power roll for each completion, it wouldn't be a big issue for me as the long wait would yield something rewarding. But right now, the reward for completing a monolith could be extremely unsatisfying.

I hear you asking; is the game about loot, or is it about blessings? Well, blessings are part loot in essence, but let me stop being a smartass for a second. It is of course about the loot, further enhancing your character at the core. And the next part is dedicated to the itemization & crafting, specificly in the endgame.

[h1]Itemization & Crafting[/h1]
At first, the game might look like the complete opposite of the PoE, especially crafting. You use affix shards to add up to four affixes you want to an item, or improve their tiers up to tier five. You have support runes and glyphs that you can use to do different stuff, like removing an affix, randomizing affix values on an item within their tiers, and so on. However, with each crafting done on an item, you add instability to it, and higher instability may cause a fracture during crafting, at which point, the item cannot be worked further on.

When you get to the endgame, you realize that there is another rarity for items: ""Exalted"". The affix tiers go up to T7, but you can only craft up to T5. Exalted items are rare items that feature these higher tier affixes on them, and you can only get them as drops. This makes crafting more of a supplement; before this tier; it's a pre-determined risk & reward to progress your character further to the max, but with this tier, getting to the max is entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.

Some affixes are extremely hard to come by. From my experience, the class-specific affixes found on class relic items are extremely rare, for example. If you fracture (damage) an item while trying to add these, or shatter (salvage) an item in order to try and get your affix shards back and get nothing, it's extremely annoying. 

To put my experience in crafting for this game in PoE terms, you have ""orbs of annulment"" in the form of a rune, but the affix removed is one at random. Then you have ""exalted orbs"" in the form of affix shards, but the added affix is pre-determined, and the same affix shards can be used till you reach tier 5. Then you have ""divine orbs"" in the form of another rune that randomize the values within their tiers. However, every craft action will add some sort of instability, and the higher instability the item has, the higher chance a fracture may occur. Fracture is similar to ""corrupt""; cannot work on the item any further, and you may lose some affix tiers in the process if it is anything but a minor fracture.

Lets say you want to craft a good item. Due to the added instability, trying to craft an all affixes @T5 item from the ground up from a white item is highly improbable; the higher quality items, will have much less instability on them for the affix tiers they've got, and you'll have a better chance to craft the item through those. If you want a specific T6/T7 affix, you'll definitely need it drop anyway. So you seek an item with the affixes you can work with as a base, and try to add the affixes you want, remove the ones you don't want, or improve existing ones up to T5. 

If you are unlucky, a fracture occurs. You can use glyphs (crafting supplements) to have a chance to reduce the added instability, or mitigate the damage of the fractures. A minor fracture locks the items, major / destructive fractures lower the tier of some affixes in addition to locking them. 

During crafting, if the affix you want gets removed, or de-leveled, or if the item gets fractured before you are done with the affix you really want, the item is essentially bricked. And I've bricked way too many items without any wins in between as RNGesus told me to fuck off even with a 1% fracture chance. Yeah, I'm mad...

I really hope that the devs will add very rare crafting supplements that'll protect your item when you are working on it, or something like a very rare ""magic glue"" to put the fractured item back together, because finding a good base is a big hassle, and when you do find one, seeing it fracture is extremely annoying, especially if the fracture occured on a very low percentage, and/or on the last step of the crafting.

In short, crafting is still as dependant on RNGesus as any other ARPG out there, and you [i]will[/i] brick good items. There is a risk involved in crafting, and you'll experience extremely unsatisfying results, and reliefs here and there after a successful craft. Just because I have some negative views on the matter due to my bad luck (streak) doesn't mean you'll definitely have a similar experience.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I've listed (cried about) the points that I don't like very much about the game but could be improved. If some of the things I mentioned bother you, you might want to think twice; I want to highly recommend the game, but these things make it a ""mild"" recommendation for me. 

The developers seem to be listening to feedback, and not entirely disconnected from their playerbase or from their game like some other devs (*cough*PoE*cough*) are. As a game still in Early Access, nothing is set in stone. 

If you are in-love with ARPG as a genre, get it. It'll keep you busy for at least 20-30 hours even if you are not that into ARPG as a genre, in my opinion. A solid entry to the genre, I hope it won't get bloated over time.

1551360,Forza Horizon 5,"I made a mistake, when I first bought the game. The first few hours were great, but then after that I just got bored. I was just like ""Where the hell am I seen this already ?"", and ahh yes, in Forza Horizon 4. The sad truth is, that I do not really see the point buying this when you have and played with Forza Horizon 4. The game is exactly the same, but it has a lot of improvements and a new map, and basically that's it. The problem is, that I already spent 100+ hours in the predecessor game, and this one just got boring. Worst part is that I bought the Premium Edition (although it only cost me 62,99€ instead of 99,99€) and never touched it since October 19, yikes. Maybe at some point in my life I'll play it again, but not now.

In my honest opinion, only buy this game if you did not played FH4 to death, otherwise you will end up in the same shoes as I am.

[b]1.Gunplay Par Excellence:[/b]
The gunplay is a symphony of power and precision, delivering impactful, satisfying shots. The handling feels robust, and there's an unmatched thrill in sniping an opposing guardian. While there's room for some balance improvements, the core gunplay is undeniably excellent.

[b]2.Dungeon and Raid Mastery:[/b]
The dungeons and raids seamlessly blend puzzles, combat, parkour, and epic boss battles. To conquer a raid, communication is key, particularly when your team comprises friends. However, with random team members, prepare for potential chaos.

[b]3.Exquisite Exotic Perks:[/b]
Destiny 2 shines through its exotic perks, offering a wide spectrum of abilities that can revolutionize your playstyle. From health restoration on melee kills to reflecting projectiles while sliding, these exotics enhance replayability and experimentation

[h2]Cons[/h2]
[b]1. DLC Dependency:[/b]
Although the base game is free, accessing endgame content and unique gear necessitates investing in DLCs. Playing Destiny 2 without these feels like munching on plain fries without salt – possible but significantly less satisfying.

[b]2.Lone Guardian's Lament:[/b]
For those without friends in the Destiny 2 universe, navigating endgame content can be an arduous task, often marred by random teammates who may not be on the same page. Playing Destiny alone can become monotonous, and the solo experience is, for some, mentally taxing.

[b]3. PvP Pandemonium:[/b]
The broader Destiny community may seem welcoming, but the illusion of friendliness crumbles in the crucible of ranked PvP. The prevalence of entitled, non-communicative players who vent frustration after underperforming can sour the PvP experience.

[b]4. Content Vanishing Act:[/b]
Destiny 2's practice of ""vaulting content"" – removing previously paid-for content with the promise of potential reintegration – is deeply frustrating. It's a surefire way to alienate players, as entire planets vanish, extensive storylines disappear, and certain gear becomes unobtainable.

[b]5. Matchmaking Mayhem:[/b]
Destiny 2's matchmaking can be bewildering, leading to situations where you and your friend face opponents with thousands of hours of experience, while your teammate barely contributes. Serious gameplay requires pre-made teams.

[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]
Ghost melee attacks and unreliable revives are a source of understandable frustration. In critical moments, these issues can lead to unexpected defeats, causing irritation, anger, and even disappointment.

[h2] Technical[/h2]
With an i5 10400f, 2070 Super, 32GB RAM, and a 280Hz 1080p monitor, you can comfortably run Destiny 2 at mid-to-max settings, maintaining an average of 180fps in PvP. While occasional drops to around 140fps may occur, stability issues are rare. A decent PC setup should provide smooth performance.

[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]
Destiny 2 offers a thrilling and enjoyable PvP experience, complemented by unique armor and weapons, as well as outstanding dungeons and raids. Yet, the game's drawbacks are too prominent to overlook, warranting a 7/10 rating. It's good but not without significant flaws.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!"" Well, that's the funny thing about this game. You don't really realize what you're getting into until you reach the true endgame. I'll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. 

First off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there's certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.

I reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn't coming from your friends, or other players, no, it's coming from the devs. They're laughing at you. ""Look at this loser"" you hear them say, ""he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot"".

Now I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it's very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. 

The last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself ""Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don't, quit, and live a happier life?"" So I did.. at least for a while, i'll explain at the end. I don't think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...

Basically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.

In conclusion, I didn't like how this game made me feel anymore. Pheons and just thinking about cutting an ability stone make me want to alt-f4. Overall, this game started to feel like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to sell me some smack and hang out with them. Fuck that. Admittedly, I still fire it up from time to time to enjoy some combat, but I could never take this game seriously the way it is.

Oh, and the game's bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.

*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn't played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more recently to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon's are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It's not worth it. As new games and MMO's come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on.

(Disclaimer: I'm a software engineer myself)

(UPDATE) I never thought this would get so much attention. Before you read the rest of this review, please keep in mind that this - like any other review out there - represents my _opinion_ about this game and mine alone. Since the game is still in development, my criticism is mostly pointed towards the acutal development of this game rather than the game itself. There might be a one in a 1000 chance that I might change this review around by the time the game gets officially released.

With a sum of almost 590 hour in this game, I've given up hope on this. We (my family) started playing about 2 years ago and it really wasn't bad back then. Of course there were bugs, things were incomplete, but that's to be expected from an Early Access game.

However, as I've been closely monitoring the development progress of the game, I see so many things going wrong in the development team, I almost feel the urge to take a plane, fly there and put some people in their place and teach them a thing or two about priorities.

It's been almost two and a half years since the release on steam, the game is far worse than it was 2 years ago. In a long period of time, Bohemia managed to keep implementing 'content' to keep the players happy, while they should've been working on engine-related systems instead. [i]Now they have to ""refactor"" every single piece of content to make it fit with the 'new engine'[/i]. As an engineer myself, I know how much time and effort this takes. The person responsible for prioritizing content over enigne should be fired and never to be allowed in game development again.

If you follow the development updates on their forums (forums.dayzgame.com), you might notice that the team works in an agile method using 'sprints'. We do the same in our office. However, usually there is one person responsible for prioritizing tasks and planing them ahead. This person clearly thinks from a business perspective instead of something to improve the quality of life of the software (maintainability, easy-adopting and stability), and it hurts me to see this happen to a studio like this.

While DayZ started the 'hype' of zombie/survival-games, a lot of much better alternatives got released in the meantime. I'm not here to advertize or suggest anything in particular since I gave up on these types of games after the horrible taste in my mouth that this game gave me.

Just to sum up some highlights of the things that happened in the past 2 years:

[list]
 [*] Dean Hall left. No more proper leadership.
 [*] Brian Hicks took over.
 [*] Content was released that needed total refactorization for the new engine (who the hell thought this was a good idea?)
 [*] Looking at the speed things are being implemented/fixed, I'm guessing there is less than a handful of actual programmers on the team.
 [*] Loot tables got completely messed up. It still isn't fixed. Central Economy? Who thought this up?
 [*] Server side programming is utterly horrible! Lag doesn't even begin to describe the rubberbanding/desynchronisation  happening in this game.
 [*] Lastly; Somebody messed up the entire world (height shifts in entire sections of the grid, floating/flying buildings, etc.)
[/list]

Especially the last point of the list above dazzles me. They have an internal testing process. They have an experimental process. Who in their right mind would push these things to a production environment? If you introduce a bug like that (which isn't a byproduct of a feature but just a complete and utter f*ck-up), you bloody FIX IT.


So, to answer the question if I would recommend this game to ANYONE:

The answer is NO. 
No you shoulnd't. Go spend your money on something more useful like a tray of sodapops or some food for the coming week. 

If anyone of Bohemia reads this, here's the proper way to ""port"" a game to a different engine:

 - Find a game to port (in this case, the DayZ mod for Arma II)
 - Build a new Engine for your game to begin with - you already knew the limitations of Arma when you guys started.
 - FINISH THE ENGINE!
 - Build a toolset for designers and artists to populate the game with content.
 - Once you have a MVP (Minimal Viable Product), go early access, AND NOT BEFORE THAT!
 - Go fix bugs, implement content - finish the game.

Apparently, people with absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in software engineering in general had leadership over the development of this ""game"".

In all seriousness though, big kudos to the team that's been there since day one. All the negative crap they get over themselves right now would completely ruin any form of motivation to even keep working on the game for me.

 17 Actual job + that creepy guy who want to be your friend by any means ( Blue Mage ) and if you insist on being a friend with the weird blue guy it will be 18 job in total. it also has non fighter classes which divided into 2 types the first is Disciples of the Hand and has 8 jobs (crafting) and the second is Disciples of the Land and has 3 jobs (Gathering).
The best thing about this game is that you don't need to create new character for each class/job, basically you can master all classes and jobs in single character and level them all to the max level (80 for now)
Each job/class has it's own questline which is good.

Simple and neat. nothing fancy but you can get pretty cool designs. 

and lots of other things i've never explored yet. if you got interested about the game play the free trial it gives you access of the most features of the game and let you level up all your classes/jobs till level 60.

           it has potential but needs a LOT more work

As at early 2024 the game is initially fun, though some tech required for some challenges is difficult to locate or not available until 3 or 4 other techs have been researched whilst the difficulty that triggered it continues. Currently 8 cultural levels in the HQ, when you get to levels 4/5 disasters start coming thick and fast and the game ceases to have any enjoyment. A *lot* of tech balancing still needs to be done. The tech tree is very linear, each band has 4 or 5 techs, generally one needs to be done to unlock 2 others, which must be done before the other 2 become available. Also some techs are unlocked by developing your HQ/CityHall. When building you have several tabs -resource, production, housing, etc. - and each tab has 4 or 5 further tabs for tech levels, searching for what you need to build to stop morale plummeting can be difficult and neither the ingame encyclopedia, the tutorial, nor the developer's responses to questions on forums are very helpful (they seem to think that their game is the only thing that you have going on in your universe and that you are going to happily play for hours trying to figure out how to deal with an issue that severely affects worker morale for a couple of game years before the required tech becomes available for research).

Personally I have had too many instances of developers biting off more than they can chew and dropping projects when it gets beyond their competence, and I am concerned that this might be another one. I bought this on special, so not too big a loss if they throw in the towel, but at this point I would not recommend paying full price.

Love the new music. Easy to use multiplayer lobby is a big step forward. Dominions are internationally simple in the economy and province upgrades department and super complex in it's magic system, forging and war. It offers a sandbox experience in three different ages (bronze, medieval, high medieval) with around 30+ unique nations to pick in each. Factions develop and diverge through times with an interesting take on lore and history inspired by many different mythologies. At one step they are barbaric. At later they form feudal kingdom with newly formed breakaway nations. Mythical giants and magic beings disappear making place for inquisitors, blood mages and heavy armored warfare. Random events spice things up. Small things like new trade route increase your income. Magical tournaments in the astral plane offer an opportunity to combat champions from all other contenders to win a powerful artifact. A demonic invasion, vampires or werewolves may occur to snatch control of your province.

2511500,Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator,"I think Illwinter have knocked it out of the park with this one! Dominions has always been a wonderful game but it's just getting better and better.

The big change here is most major game mechanics have been changed to facilitate bigger battles (the battlefield is huge with many more units onscreen at once than Dom5), with more focus on rank n file troops for longer, more gradiation in how spell AoE effects scale up and better controls for commanders and squads. This all goes together to make combat more nuanced, interesting and tactically rich, as more areas of the battlefield can be focused upon for assaulting, for defence, for more complex formations and so on.

A drastic improvement over Dominions 5 in terms of it's single player experience, the UI is a lot better with more info available at a single keystroke and drag n drop unit selection in the battle-setup screen, and much, much bigger battles. New planes to explore, riders and mounts being separated into individual units with some really cool rules.

Even the graphics have improved, with many new sprites and some of the older ones being redrawn, while Illwinter's random map generation now makes somewhat nicer looking maps too.

The new nations are all really interesting, some of them are on the more difficult end to learn (nice for veterans) and the lore written for them is as excellent as ever.

This is top quality work from Illwinter, and whether you're playing multiplayer or singleplayer, there's a lot to love. I fully expect this will be the biggest selling Illwinter game yet owing to increase in accessibility and overall user experience.

105600,Terraria,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.

[u]Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool.[/u] You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses. 

Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic. 

Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.

So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.


[u]And Now for the Parts of the Game You Might Not Find so Cool.[/u] First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)

Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games. 

One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki) 

I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long. 

So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever.",terrarium one top rated game steam honestly deserves think damn good game say perfect game certainly thing know buy happily give recommend u let begin game make cool u start basic sword axe pickaxe middle nowhere first step get wood build shelter protect zombie night next need dig get ore make better gear 2d minecraft well let continue need decent armor weapon fight tougher monster live underground fight boss yep boss boss one defining element game boss big imposing play awesome adrenaline music summon lot terrarium music awesome btw huge variety boss floating eye aggressively charge big worm creature break smaller worm damage angry plant fought claustrophobic jungle cult leader summons mirage make game bullet hell many projectile spit boss punishing building crafting game build arena platform jump wall protect attack craft potion boost speed health regen armor damage fact tackle boss term arena one interesting part game really make bos fight feel epic killing boss main way progress game killing give kickass loot let access part world discover kickass loot lot loot game pretty cool loot get staff call meteor sky fireball staff sword shoot fireball machine gun rocket launcher different kind ammo go gun yo yo yo yos really cool weapon boomerang tool summon monster turret fight tool let jump real high useful dodging bos attack vehicle let move real fast grappling hook going spelunking boss kill progress powerful interesting loot get seriously getting new loot feel absolutely wonderful game yeah would say mining bos fighting collecting loot meat game plenty gravy maybe want take break bos fighting fishing get chainsaw fish also potion ingredient well probably want create pond throughout world probably want set minecart track teleporters get pond quickly maybe want set mushroom farm mushroom good potion well crafting late game armor well want create several row dirt mushroom plenty surface area spawn want harvest mushroom manually set bunch conveyor belt wire mushroom fall come maybe part world corrupt corruption spread slowly may want dig trench around keep quarantined buy special gun clean corruption outright maybe need bunch unicorn horn could go part world unicorn spawn kill flaming yo yo could dig big pit every time unicorn come fall pit dy pit full lava spiky trap crafting game enemy another crafting resource setting death pit farm unicorn logical thing plenty stuff terrarium plenty way u part game might find cool u first difficulty specifically boss boss kill boss tough give boost potion armor dodging attack best bet difficult bos charge rapidly shoot dozen ball lightning need learn attack pattern boss need train reflex mentioned bullet hell earlier really think game bullet hell element stand bullet hell game probably want avoid terrarium since difficulty pretty subjective thing may want look video review terrarium see bos fight combat another thing want mention sheer amount stuff learn prepared spend lot time terrarium wiki crafting game need look crafting recipe well get ingredient also game fighting giant boss need know summon boss probably want read tip making arena want build garden fishing pond want know certain herb bloom much water put pond building complex structure may want look tutorial youtube game gone several update though youtube tutorial date personally kinda enjoyed learning game get weird item inventory immediately going wiki see could realize everyone want study wiki play video game one interesting part game building fighting hybrid kind game cool time really annoying time say underground building arena fight bos bat fly stop building take weapon kill bat try get back building another bat spawn kill one game literally formula detects enemy near spawn new enemy constantly fight annoying enemy trying build mine mention tool help deal enemy harassment need know get reinforces point need read wiki really like terrarium endgame early midgame consists exploring building crafting occasional action packed bos fight thrown like offer nice variety however endgame back back combat fight bos fight bunch minibosses fight another bos fight four living tower spawn fast dangerous enemy fight another bos first playthrough game stopped playing got endgame want slog fighting actually like combat liked fighting boss throughout game simple combat system fighting loses charm long review turned longer expected guess wanted thorough first played game got pretty frustrated time prepared toss game altogether got bit learned mechanic better actually really liked despite flaw probably one favorite game ever

• Great mix between management and rogue-like game

scary in real life.
• Has an addictive flavour to it and it's difficult to put down.
• Great art-style with cute characters.
• Great and satisfying music and sound-effects.

• For those who are looking for a more in-depth

a full-fledged system.
• Has unfortunately an ending if you're looking to go 
over and over again. Great for me, but I've heard that

	[td]Cult of the Lamb is a fun and addictive game that welcomes casual rogue-like or rogue-lite players to the genre. it's cute art style and interesting setting makes it very enjoyable and unique. A game worth playing and as it did for me, it may fit in your top 10 best games of 2022.[/td]

[/table]

Cult of the Lamb casts players in the role of a possessed lamb saved from annihilation by an ominous god and must repay their debt by building a loyal following in his name. You're tasked to defeat those who has wronged you and from there your adventure begins.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

The game is split in two ways of playing. Town management, where you build and look after the level, hunger and faith of your cult followers and the rogue-lite aspect, where you try to survive and fight your enemies and for each run you become stronger and stronger, slowly crossing each boss off your list. It's a fun and simple mechanic that anybody can pick up with little rogue-like/rogue-lite experience.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2861267618

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

I've enjoyed most of my time in the game. Although at the end, I felt I've rather cleared everything and I no longer required faith points to get, I wish there was more to it than that and offered a more complex and advanced experience.

[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

Cult of the Lamb has a similar art-style with Don't Starve Together, where you're presented with an interesting 2.5D paper like art-style. It's very distinct and unique and I'm sure most people will find it interesting.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

Music and sound effects in this game are very satisfying to listen to. Although repetitive as sound, it's overall an enjoyable track that never gets old. The combat music is well felt and is right in its place to hold tension and control. Sound effects, like gathering faith points is SO SATISFING. Great sound overall. The voice-acting is gibberish, but it's fun to listen to.

[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★☆☆

The story behind this game is rather simple, but interesting. It's not something I'm personally interested in, but it served its purpose quite a bit. To keep it short and spoiler free: You're a Lamb that is to be sacrificed, but you're saved by an omniscient god that asks you to serve it and in return he offers you power and asks you to defeat the other gods that attempted to kill you. Your journey starts from there, where you meet interesting new characters and get stronger every time.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2861267756

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3]

🔲  Short
☑️ Average
🔲 Long 
🔲 Unlimited

The game is rather average in length. For more experienced soul-lite players you can complete this game under 20 hours for sure. But if you're a casual, like myself, 25-30 hours should be enough to clear it.

[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3]

🔲 Easy
☑️ Normal
☑️ Hard
🔲 Brutally Hard
🔲 Impossible

The game has its difficulty spikes here and there and some bosses felt harder than others to defeat. Paying attention to projectile spreading and other hitboxes is what will keep you alive and victorious. Learn the attack patterns of each individual monster and you'll become successful.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3]
Cult of the Lamb has been a great entry for me in the rogue-lite experience and one of the first games I've picked and played through using my newly purchased Steam Deck. It has been a fun game that I recommend to anybody who would like to manage and coordinate a cult, but as well have some intense boss battles.

I really enjoy this game. Things I don't like: They need to add a bigger variety of trucks, they really need to add Freightliners, and a few more models of each one. Like the classic Freightliner and Pete, some cabovers and some more of the newer models as well. I guess the one thing that bothers me the most are the truck stop gas stations. I don't know about in other countries but In the U.S. they don't have 2 pumps in one row like a car gas station. They have 1 pump in each row and the one on the driver side is where you swipe your card and put in your info and the passenger side is just a pump so you can fill both tanks, so at ever truck stop there is a pump on both sides of the truck in every row. If SCS reads my review I hope you all will do some research into US truck stops and hopefully, even though I'm sure it would be a little bit of work, would redo the truck stops to be more realistic and maybe even get the licenses to re-name them. I would love to see a Pilot or Petro in the game. Other than that I do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes simulated driving games.",rl truck driver think done amazing job game regarding physic graphic basically everything else especially float gear like real life steering wheel shifter really enjoy game thing like need add bigger variety truck really need add freightliners model one like classic freightliner pete cabovers newer model well guess one thing bother truck stop gas station know country u 2 pump one row like car gas station 1 pump row one driver side swipe card put info passenger side pump fill tank ever truck stop pump side truck every row sc read review hope research u truck stop hopefully even though sure would little bit work would redo truck stop realistic maybe even get license name would love see pilot petro game highly recommend game anyone like simulated driving game

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Do I recommend this game? Yes. But...

If you're happy to pay £18-£23 for a game that will keep you entertained for around 12 - 25 hours, (£1/£1.50/Hour) then by all means, go a head with the purchase. You will have fun if you're into this genre and you will get engrossed in it. But then you'll just stop.

You'll enjoy getting yourself set up, building your first village and investing in who you want to work in it.
You'll enjoy laying it out, and doing the side quests and getting it to look pretty.
You'll enjoy the atmosphere, hunting game, and growing your dynasty as you explore and unlock more things.

But then, all of a sudden, you'll realise there really isn't that much more to do.
All of a sudden you'll realise just how bad the AI is at operating in its current state,
you'll realise that after all those villagers joined your town, and they're all working for you, that you still aren't making any gains in your resources.

In it's current state, this game isn't finished, but it never said it was. The game is enjoyable, but it's just not there yet. The management side for me, was one of the biggest draws to this game. I want to make a village, have it thrive and use that as my base village to leech off of, so I can go and make a better, bigger, more planned main village. However, at the moment, this just isn't possible.

So, would I recommend this game? Yes, I would, BUT, don't go expecting a completed game. I think if the developers stick to what they're trying to achieve, this game will become a classic - We've just got to hope they stick with the original vision. I love sandbox games, and I love management games.

What does the game need:
+ Better UI displays, making it clearer what villagers are up to, where you need to place tools and what symbols mean
+ More buildings orientated around the growth of your city - E.g. Inns,  (Enabling sleeping in other cities, drinking in your / other cities, money to go back into your city), Stores (So you don't have to keep going and selling berries to the nearest town), Guest houses, (for passing hunters, miners, travellers, traders), localised laws, etc etc.
+ Life, it needs character - At the moment, your villagers wake up, go to work, and reappear before the nights end, to go to bed. That's as close as you'll get to your villagers. After you've got yourself a wife, I saw no point in even engaging with any of them apart from the odd quest to benefit my dynasty points. I want villagers to have dinner together, to hook up together, to celebrate years end together, things like that.
+ Transportation: At the moment, if you wanted to go live in a nice empty space next to a river, you'd have to do SO many walks back and forth to build up your buildings. We need something like The Forest has, that enables you to transport logs quicker than only being able to carry the max of like 13 I think? Further more, if you decided to base yourself somewhere away from the starting town, you'd have to continuously travel back and forth to this town, just to follow the main story line.
+ Difficulty: I just started a fresh save, and within the first 15 minutes, I had killed numerous deer, 2 wolves and a bear. If you've got a spear, and you can aim at a head, all you need to do is crouch up to them, and hit the head. GGWP you win.
+ A more detailed explanation on how processes work: For instance, if you were to make a lumbercamp, and set a worker to it, you'd presume that would mean that worker would collect you wood. And for a while, it 'wood'. However, if you do not continue to put axes in the chest of THAT lumbercamp, then eventually they'll collect sticks instead of wood. But, your only way to notice this, is if you keep inventory of your resources and log that your logs aren't going up, whilst your sticks are. I built a workshop and assigned someone to that, but I've no clue what they were doing other than lowering my sticks. I put someone in a tavern, I think they made food but I'm not sure. Do they needs tool? I had people working my farms, they'd do fine when there was something to harvest, but they never managed to re-sow anything. I had someone working as a farmer in my barn, but they never processed any rye into flower - It's just all a bit unclear.
+ Travelling NPCS - Apart from the people in the town, you'll encounter no one on your travels. This makes the whole area seem very.. empty. I want to see people going from town to town, trading or visiting family. If carts or something similar were added to this (I'm sure it's planned), this would help a lot.

TLDR: Yes, I recommend the game if you're willing to play around 10-20 hours in it's current state. But, just please be aware, this is an EA, you're putting your trust in this developer (which I recommend you do at the moment, the updates have been coming in thick and fast), they've stated their intentions of what they want this game to be, I just hope to god they make it, because this could be bloody fantastic!

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"There are a lot of games like this, most notably Banished, Life is Feudal: Forest Village, the Settlers series, the Tropico series,  Hearthlands, etc., etc., although each of them tries to add on its own twist (first-person view in Forest Village, no food requirements in Settlers, politics in Tropico, ""tech-trees"" in Hearthlands, etc.).

The formula boils down to the same thing each time: balancing the economy.  An abundance of X is a waste of your efforts, especially when there is a shortage of Y that you need to address.  This is what Kingdoms and Castles does amazingly.  The neat twist it puts on this genre: your town must now do tower defense, against a random opponent who won't wipe out your city completely, every 10 years in-game time or so.

What can go wrong in these types of games?  If you overproduce just one commodity sufficiently, it will flood the distribution channels and cause traffic jams (Hearthlands) -- restart game.  If you run out of medicine or clothing or some required item that you started out with a stockpile, then everyone in the village dies (Banished) -- restart game.  If you harvest all of the iron on the starting map and use it on toasters instead of swords (Settlers) -- restart game.  If you build a city that's so big that citizens can't do adequate path-finding in time (Tropico) -- restart game.

In Kingdoms and Castles: (1) producers auto self-regulate to prevent over-production, (2) lack of food is the only thing that can cause mass starvations, and it's temporary, (3) all mines may produce limitless quantities, (4) path-finding is notoriously accurate and almost error-proof.

For $10, this is a GOOD BUY.  I hope they add more content, though, without messing up the economy.  From what I see with patch updates so far, I'm excited!

These are my impressions so far:

-Runs great, to the point that I haven't had a single instance of frame drops after 26 hours in.
-Looks clean and crispy.
-Good level designs.
-Huge enemy varieties.
-Great Boss designs and fights.
-Good music.
-Great amounts of good looking weapons as well as the ability to customize them. More specifically, you can attach blades to other weapons handles, which come with their own abilities and scalings (which you can also change). And this isn't all. There's also Legion Arm with it's own customizable abilities and upgrades, etc.
-Decent amounts of outfits.
-Sometimes a little campy, but so far the story is pretty well crafted and quite interesting.

I can just keep going on and on about how great this game is, but the bottom line is that, if you're a soulsborne fan (especially Bloodborne), this game is gonna scratch that itchy spot, that you're so desperately trying to reach.

289070,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"When I first played Sid Meier's Civ 1, I played to exhaustion, watching a friend's apartment, fell asleep on the floor for a few hours, and played again, until he and his wife came home.  He let me keep the game.  After a week, I settled down to a few hours per day, back when my disabilities made employment harder to find.  That game, and Civ 2, 3, and 4, helped keep me going.

With Civ 5, another friend talked me out of the kiddie pool of lower difficulty settings, and I discovered how much fun each of the 40-some sides could be.  The same friend gifted me Civ 6, for last Christmas, and I liked it so much, I gifted the $80 every-DLC-as-it-comes-out edition to another friend.  I put about 15,000 hours into Civ 5, and have already put over 4,000 hours into Civ 6.  

My first impression was as bewildered as had been my first encounter with Civ 5.  Gorgeous as Civ 6 is, my main thought was channeling UPS: ""What can brown do for you?""  But eventually I figured out how to assign envoys.  Now I can even interpret the graphics for developed hexes in others' empires' sepia tones.

Occasionally, the map gets stuck scrolling, and I have to save, exit, and restart the game.  But I go weeks without that happening.  I haven't run into any other annoying factors.

So far, I've played Pericles' culture-focused Greece, Russia for a religion win, China for wonder-spamming and science,  Tomyris' unstoppable Scythians, and my favorite so far, the peaceful Canadians.  Each one has been full of unique fun.  I hope you enjoy this game.  There are lots of good video play-throughs on YouTube and Twitch, of course.

1627720,Lies of P,"[h2] I am absolutely floored [/h2]
I was buying this game to get a discount Fromsoft game, but what I found instead was truly special in ways I did not expect.
Lies of P wears its inspirations on its sleeve, so it is easy to assume that many people who think about buying the game (and reading this review as a result) want to play something like Bloodborne and are contemplating if they should buy this one.
This review is for people like that. I have 100%ed every FromSoft game including Bloodborne, so the described experience might be completely different for a new player to the genre.
Let's cut to the chase - I think Lies of P is a much better game than Bloodborne. Before you leave a clown award on this review, please give me a moment to explain.
[h2] Combat [/h2]
Before we start, it is important to note that I absolutely love Bloodborne. But, in my opinion, people really tend to overhype it for what it is. The main game Bloodborne has 2 or 3 good bosses with literally every other boss being ""strafe right hit R1"". Bosses like Paarl died without me even understanding what just happened. Lies of P avoids this issue completely, and nearly every single boss (with a single exception, looking at you Chapter 10 gang) feels amazing to fight.
It scratches the same itch as good Sekiro bosses do. You get into this flow state where you can parry attack after attack and it just feels incredible. Bosses in Lies of P rarely die on a first attempt. Game really demands you to learn the attack pattern of each boss and perform well throughout the whole fight.
[h2] Difficulty [/h2]
If you are a newer player I think Bloodborne will be a much better starting point. Lies of P is rough. I would even go as far as to say that this is the hardest souls-like game I’ve ever played. But as usual, you have your options. Summoning NPCs to draw boss aggro away, using absolutely busted throwables, or a shield-hand will make the experience a ton easier if you are looking to tone down difficulty a notch.
[h2] Exploration [/h2]
While the level design in Bloodborne might be less linear, it kinda feels homogenized to me. The entirety of Yahrnam just feels the same, I can't name any non-DLC area that isn't a city or a forest. At the same time each area in Lies of P feels distinct to me. It might be more linear, but level design is equally as great. A bunch of nooks and crannies to explore, secrets to find and shortcuts to open.
[h2] Progression [/h2]
One of the biggest issues I have with Bloodborne that this game avoids is the lack of gameplay variety. Sure, trick weapons are cool and all, but not being able to change your build to try out new weapons funnels you into using just a couple of weapons during your entire playthrough. You don't get enough upgrade materials to upgrade some random weapon on a whim and play with it for a while.
Both of these issues combined resulted in me playing the entirety of Bloodborne start to finish with a cane-whip thing because it felt like the most effective weapon at nearly all times. Sure, I might’ve found something better along the way, but I couldn’t risk spending precious upgrade materials to check out the weapon at its full potential. Lies of P is extremely generous with weapon upgrade materials but strikes a perfect balance where you wouldn’t be able to upgrade everything under the sun immediately either.
[h2] QoL [/h2]
While might not seem important, it’s the little things that add up during the playtime that decide your overall enjoyment of the game. For example, the fast travel system in Bloodborne is horrible, zones are split into different fast-travel objects with no images attached to names of locations, and sometimes it's infuriating to try and remember which place was which. I don’t even have to mention the fact that healing items not replenishing on rest.
Lies of P, on top of improving everything I just mentioned also goes the extra mile by having a bunch of QoL stuff, like training dummies in the hub to check your weapon damage and movesets, tells you when a certain NPC wants to talk to you, and reminds you where you picked up that quest you just completed so you don't have to teleport around the entire game trying to remember who wanted this bottle of wine you just found.
[h2] Story [/h2]
Both games have great stories, but I liked the story for Lies of P more. This point is completely subjective though, more so than everything else. Characters in Lies of P were interesting enough for me to come back to Hotel Krat to listen to what they had to say each time a new dialogue became available. There’s just something so magical about the Hotel, the music, the ambiance, I just can’t get enough of it.
[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
At this point it might sound like I just hate Bloodborne, but no, not at all. I think it was a brilliant game, but isn't a gift from gaming Gods that many people make it out to be.
Is Lies of P without faults? Of course no. Some of the boss attacks aren't clearly telegraphed, the difficulty balancing can use more work. The endgame is rough with chapter 10's gank boss absolutely sucking and climbing the tower in the end being rather tedious. However, these issues don't stop the game from being absolutely fantastic in my opinion.
Overall, I don't think most people would ever agree that this game is better than Bloodborne simply because of how iconic Bloodborne has become over the years. But for me Lies of P is so much more.

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,"I know what you're thinking. Like me, you probably see this on a sale, and think it's gone down in price, it was a hot topic a while ago, and maybe you should take advantage of the opportunity that you see before you and pick it up while you have the chance. It's been out for a while, and they've probably cleared out most of the bugs by now, and it's *probably* a pretty good game at this point. 

It is. Kind of. You'll probably be able to make it through the main story, and a few of the most important side quests relatively bug free. The story is great. I think it's partially worth it on story alone. But because of that, you'll be longing for more. You'll keep seeing it in your steam library a month or two later, and feel guilty that you haven't picked it back up again. But you'll know that as soon as you do, you will continually be disappointed.

It feels unfinished outside of the main story. There's content there, but it gets repetitive really quickly. There are tons of opportunities to buy new vehicles, and do more side gigs. But half of the time spent playing the game outside of the main story arc is spent searching through articles and forum posts about how to get an event to trigger that you missed, or to hack your way around an issue here or there. Mission events that are totally out of your control like waiting for a phone call just don't happen. And the worst part is, yes, you can get it to work. You can *technically* play everything that exists in the game in its current state. But eventually the workarounds will become too cumbersome. You'll let it sit on your recently played list for a while, until the next sale, when you can replace it with something better.

I'm just here to tell you that when this time inevitably comes, it's okay to let it go. You had a great run, but there's no shame in uninstalling.

1449850,Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel,"[h1]A very real review from a Yu-Gi-Oh! vet and ive played since 99 for reference.[/h1]

Listen ill be blunt, dont come to this game if you thought it was gonna be anything like those old gameboy games we once played with updated graphics and pretty animations. The game as is has lot of balance issues and has a lot of things that need to be added, but its not rushed in any way or form and you can tell they have spent a lot of time polishing things to look great and feel as smooth as possible on launch. That being said it can be smoother and it can be tweaked to fit the current player base. But for the vets that wanted an old school game this isnt for you...YET!

This game can honestly be their next longevity game but they have to add some things and help balance the game so meta decks dont run rampant and people are not compelled to go to the other community based ones. that list is as followed and please add things as you feel needed that way we can hopefully get this the attention it needs and people can see a real review and Konami can see some things that will greatly improve there game!

1. Timer needs to be much lower to force people to play there combos faster and know there cards better and ultimately streamline the game, you either know what you are doing and do it quickly or suffer because you sat there for 3 minutes doing absolutely nothing but trying to read your own card. My suggestion is 2-3 minutes per turn which is more than enough time to get your combos out, and with each successful card use it adds 2 seconds which may not sound like a lot but after 10 cards its 20 seconds and can help stabilize longer combos.

2. implement 3 other modes outside of ranked mode ,Casuals, Ranked gen 1, and ranked gen 2. Casuals needs no explanation , so for ranked gen one its a ranked mode for all people who wish to test there might against all other who use only cards that involve ritual and fusion cards, nothing past that, no synchro no XYZ nothing, now that doesnt mean they cant use cards like the new blue-eyes max and such but it means they have to fine tune the deck to be more inline with literally just fusion and ritual monsters at their core. and rank two is the same thing but it goes all they way up to synchro and XYZ summoning and doesnt include pendulum and link,thus creating a more 5Ds era of ranked and dueling. By doing this it opens up to a more wide range of players and people can compete without feeling power crept by all the new gen cards and it can even bring in old school people who know how to make a ruthless toon deck.

3. A few more ways to earn more in game gems even if it takes a bit longer, also a way to unlock secret packs permanently. for this i believe for more in game gems maybe have weekly missions that people can do throughout the week that give them 1k gems for a 10 pack draw a week, not to much but atleast something to look forward too. now as far as secret packs i believe that once you get 1 of every copy of the featured card on the secret pack list maybe it should be opened permanently or for every 1 time they get every featured card on secret pack maybe its time is extended exactly one week, because at that pint all they need is maybe a couple of copies and if they have a weekly mission that gives them 10 pulls that will literally be there time frame (hopefully that makes sense).

4. A Banlist please... good lord having three copies of maxx C is insane and man is that hilarious, i crafted exactly one copy because i know its gonna be limited, but please make an updated banlist and limited list.

5. Community engagement, you guys have a chance to make this one of the best games Yu-Gi-Oh! has seen since duelist of roses( dang im getting old) and that can easily be done so long as you listen to the community and watch for the trolls and dont cater to the top 1% and streamers, please understand i dont hate streamers and the 1% because ultimately they help grow the player base, but when you cater to them the game literally slowly but surely dies off and thats when things get to being unbalanced and none new player friendly.

There are more issues but those are the ones off the top of my head and hopefully the community here will add some that they feel is important and i will edit this and add them as i see fit. these next issues are something that can be added for QOL and just to help maybe a few people.

6. More animations for boss monsters I.E special attacks and effects for their cards. For example if someone summons blue eyes and they attack it could have its own special attack animation, along with certain spell cards and popular cards having really unique animations to bring the game to life in a new way. like if Halberd Cannon uses its effect you literally get a small animation of him using it etc.

7. Some deck features that could be nice like a few more cards sleeves,  a few more search functions and maybe a few more deck slots.

8. More in-depth tutorial. Newer players might not skip the tutorial but they also dont get a lot from this one, having a more in-depth one that actually teaches them the ins and outs for cards and uses could improve the longevity of this game.

Now this issues is a specific one for those that do like to spend money and dont mind uses mommies credit card.

9. You guys seriously need much better gem prices and i mean way better, look at what happen to halo with there prices when they were not good, they had to go back, apologize and revamp half their store, it was crazy. soon you guys will definitely hear the backlash of your gem prices i can assure you that because 25 bucks is 1 10 pack pull and thats insane i would argue that every 16-17 bucks is about 10 packs thus thats like a 7 dollar difference per 10 packs which is 35% i believe. Now while i understand that its new and the game hasnt had any balancing and such and basing things off 10 pack purchase isnt always wise this is again for those whom wish to spend money and after ding math and looking at TCG and OCG card box prices which this should be based off of because its virtual and there are other cosmetics and such people will want to spend money on, its wise to slightly lower the price of gems to help people who do want to spend money and not have them feel ripped off, the happier they feel the more they want to spend Just saying.

10. Cosmetics, Yes i know the game just released and they have some cosmetics and such this is just saying that adding more will definitely be a good idea and i believe the price for them is spot on, maybe even a bit cheap but again i digress it a great thing, please add more and maybe even have community votes and such on what can be added.

11. Add in character mates. Joey wheeler or Jaden as my mate sounds freaking amazing and i believe they should be 800-1k gems over the other mates and have a few more animations and should have special animations when summoning cards they either used or know bringing the game to life once again in a unique way.


If you have made it this far i thank you and hope that you will add what you believe the game needs to help balance it and give it more life for both the community sake and the game sake.",h1 real review yu gi oh vet ive played since 99 reference h1 listen ill blunt dont come game thought gon na anything like old gameboy game played updated graphic pretty animation game lot balance issue lot thing need added rushed way form tell spent lot time polishing thing look great feel smooth possible launch said smoother tweaked fit current player base vet wanted old school game isnt yet game honestly next longevity game add thing help balance game meta deck dont run rampant people compelled go community based one list followed please add thing feel needed way hopefully get attention need people see real review konami see thing greatly improve game 1 timer need much lower force people play combo faster know card better ultimately streamline game either know quickly suffer sat 3 minute absolutely nothing trying read card suggestion 2 3 minute per turn enough time get combo successful card use add 2 second may sound like lot 10 card 20 second help stabilize longer combo 2 implement 3 mode outside ranked mode casuals ranked gen 1 ranked gen 2 casuals need explanation ranked gen one ranked mode people wish test might use card involve ritual fusion card nothing past synchro xyz nothing doesnt mean cant use card like new blue eye max mean fine tune deck inline literally fusion ritual monster core rank two thing go way synchro xyz summoning doesnt include pendulum link thus creating 5ds era ranked dueling open wide range player people compete without feeling power crept new gen card even bring old school people know make ruthless toon deck 3 way earn game gem even take bit longer also way unlock secret pack permanently believe game gem maybe weekly mission people throughout week give 1k gem 10 pack draw week much atleast something look forward far secret pack believe get 1 every copy featured card secret pack list maybe opened permanently every 1 time get every featured card secret pack maybe time extended exactly one week pint need maybe couple copy weekly mission give 10 pull literally time frame hopefully make sense 4 banlist please good lord three copy maxx c insane man hilarious crafted exactly one copy know gon na limited please make updated banlist limited list 5 community engagement guy chance make one best game yu gi oh seen since duelist rose dang im getting old easily done long listen community watch troll dont cater top 1 streamer please understand dont hate streamer 1 ultimately help grow player base cater game literally slowly surely dy thats thing get unbalanced none new player friendly issue one top head hopefully community add feel important edit add see fit next issue something added qol help maybe people 6 animation bos monster e special attack effect card example someone summons blue eye attack could special attack animation along certain spell card popular card really unique animation bring game life new way like halberd cannon us effect literally get small animation using etc 7 deck feature could nice like card sleeve search function maybe deck slot 8 depth tutorial newer player might skip tutorial also dont get lot one depth one actually teach in out card us could improve longevity game issue specific one like spend money dont mind us mommy credit card 9 guy seriously need much better gem price mean way better look happen halo price good go back apologize revamp half store crazy soon guy definitely hear backlash gem price assure 25 buck 1 10 pack pull thats insane would argue every 16 17 buck 10 pack thus thats like 7 dollar difference per 10 pack 35 believe understand new game hasnt balancing basing thing 10 pack purchase isnt always wise wish spend money ding math looking tcg ocg card box price based virtual cosmetic people want spend money wise slightly lower price gem help people want spend money feel ripped happier feel want spend saying 10 cosmetic yes know game released cosmetic saying adding definitely good idea believe price spot maybe even bit cheap digress great thing please add maybe even community vote added 11 add character mate joey wheeler jaden mate sound freaking amazing believe 800 1k gem mate animation special animation summoning card either used know bringing game life unique way made far thank hope add believe game need help balance give life community sake game sake
216150,MapleStory,"I genuinely enjoy the game, but I feel that it is morally incorrect to recommend the game to others and downright evil to recommend the game to friends. The game itself is fun, and the skills and combat can feel very satisfying. Each of the many jobs offers a different play-style so players have some options with how they want to interact with the game.

The problem is that the game feels fun and inviting at first, but as soon as you start thinking ""Wow, I like this character, I wanna see how far I can go with it,"" Nexon has already won.

First, you have to get a character from level 1 to level 200. This will take a few days at first, but each character you do this with will take a shorter amount of time to reach level 200. If the first climb to level 200 already felt too grindy, I recommend stopping immediately because it will get much, much worse.

Each of the different jobs have a special skill called a ""Link Skill."" For some job, these link skills have only 2 levels. Getting level 1 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 70, and getting level 2 in a link skill requires getting the character to level 120. Some characters have a third level to their link skill which is gained at level 210.

Link skills are special in that they can be transferred or ""linked"" to another one of your characters in the same world. The character that the link skill comes from always has that link skill active whether it's linked to another character or not.

So if there is more than one job that you enjoy, you can have those characters give each other some link skills to make them a bit stronger. You may swap out link skills among your many characters up to 10 times per day, but after changing out a particular link skill 3 times, you have to spend some in-game currency if you want to swap that skill another 1 to 7 times.

Another mechanic of the game is called ""Legion."" You're given a special board called the Legion board, which looks like, and is, a large grid. You're also given a number called your legion rank. Your legion rank is equal to the combined total of all your levels on each character in a particular world. As you level up a character, its levels are added to your legion rank. Additionally, at certain level thresholds, you are given a ""legion block"" that represents that particular character. These blocks look like and work similarly to Tetris pieces.

These blocks can occupy a number of spaces on the legion board depending on the character's level. At level 60 a block can occupy one space, at level 100 a block can occupy two spaces, at level 140 a block can occupy three spaces, at level 200 a block can occupy four spaces, and at level 250 a block can occupy five spaces.

The legion board has spaces that grant stats when legion blocks are placed on them. So, for example, if you place a block with a size of 3 in the ""Str"" or ""Strength"" region of the board, each of your characters on that world will gain a flat +3 str or strength to their stats. Additionally, each character provides its own legion bonus that also depends on the number of spaces that it takes up on the board. For example, a Hero class will give a flat +10, +20, +40, +80, and +100 strength at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

""Flat"" means that the stats gained aren't affected by any other modifiers.

Each of these legion ""bonuses"" that a particular character provides can only be gained once. So if you get two Hero classes to 100, the strength bonuses from that particular class won't stack and will only be counted once.

So now that I've taken the time to explain Link Skills and Legion, why should these systems matter with whether or not the game should be played?

Here's the problem: Reaching ""endgame"" or somewhere close to it in this game essentially means getting every possible class to either level 200 or level 210. Level 200 when the character has a level 2 link skill, and level 210 when the character has a level 3 link skill. This is to get every character to provide at four spaces minimum on the legion board while also getting every link skill to its maximum level.

Levels 200+ are usually considered to be where ""real game"" starts nowadays, and pushing just a single character from 200 to 250 takes considerable effort, to the point where getting a level 5 legion block with every character could be considered a lifetime achievement.

Getting a character beyond 250 (the level cap is currently 300) is generally only feasible with about 3-4 characters at best, so most a lot of emphasis is placed on about 1-2 characters, which are a player's ""mains.""

You need to get every character to 200 or 210 in order to funnel the majority of your time, energy, and resources into one single character.

And that's all before mentioning that most of the content is massively time-gated, enhancing equipment to be suitable for late-game or end-game is ""pay-to-win"" in regular worlds, and cosmetics you buy with REAL MONEY from the cash shop only last 90 DAYS. That's right, you don't get to keep the digital cosmetics that you spent money on.

You CAN get permanent cosmetics by purchasing and opening the ""Surprise Style Boxes"" (SSBs) in the cash shop, but it's completely random which cosmetic equipment you'll get. You could potentially spend hundreds and not get the cosmetics that you want from a particular ""SSB"" rotation. The same thing goes for royal hair and face coupons. If there's a particular hairstyle or face style you want and it's listed on a royal hair/face coupon? Gotta roll for it.

I play the game because I don't mind grinding and sometimes even enjoy it while listening to music. It's something I kinda do mindlessly when I want to relax for a while.

I love the lore of this game and I'm usually excited to learn new bits of info about it. The story and writing is often cheesy and silly, but I think that's part of its charm. The music in this game can be repetitive, but personally I don't really get tired of it and find some tracks to be relaxing and/or awesome. The combat can be very satisfying and a lot of fun. The game makes you feel powerful as you take down swarms and swarms of enemies per attack.

I think the game itself is fine and even enjoyable and fun. There's simply no other 2d game, or mmo that feels quite like maplestory, and that's why some players find it to be so difficult to leave. There are parts of it that I love and genuinely enjoy, but it's plagued by subtle and extremely predatory monetization practices and a company that goes to any lengths that it can to exploit and take advantage of the player-base. Nexon simply does not care about the players in the slightest, and tries to pretend that they care whenever something happens that might affect the money they're making.

To summarize: It's a great game plagued by a terrible company and terrible pay-to-win practices, and getting further and further in the game requires exponential levels of grinding.

I feel I must re-iterate that I feel that to recommend this game to others is to subject them to the same issues that the current player-base is dealing with and as such would be morally questionable.

Recommending the game a friend and having that friend actually get into and enjoy the game might end up ruining their life with the levels of grinding this game requires, and as such I think to do that to a friend would be downright evil.

If you read all this and think you'd be fine with it, then proceed, but again I CANNOT and WILL NOT recommend this game to others.

----
Updated Full Review as of 2020-08-20

After testing the simulator for a fair bit of time, I wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulator. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator graphically speaking, is simply the best we've had in a flight simulator. For the longest time, clouds rendered in simulators like P3D or X-Plane 11 were 2D and flat (albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds) but with FS2020, we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulation. 

The weather system is great but has a flaw that I've seen. The METAR will sometimes be outdated by 1 hour and show weather that is not representative of what the weather actually is at a certain airport. It can sometimes be significantly behind or sometimes be accurate to the weather currently at an airport but hopefully with time, these issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue. The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted. Gives the wind a more ""alive"" feel.

The aerodynamics have been improved from the days of FSX and P3D. In those sims, it felt as if you were on rails. The aerodynamics are not comparable to X-Plane 11 which I feel has the better flight model (though it does feel too exaggerated). Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcade-like which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera. I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdown.

The biggest selling point to the game in my opinion is the use of satellite imagery and AI to create autogen. The ground scenery is some of the best ever seen in a flight simulator to date. It uses Bing Maps which is not as good as Google Maps in my opinion but it does the job well enough to make for a realistic experience.

Some of the aircraft have problems with autopilots not functioning correctly, missing features in the GPS systems such as in the G1000 where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIM, and just general performance issues. They look really nice but don't have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them. They should however, try to make really good avionics. Kind of like how X-Plane 11 has a fully functional G1000, GNS430 and GNS530 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default. Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinion.

The biggest problem I have with the simulator is how buggy and unoptimized the simulator is. I feel that the simulator needed more time to be ironed out with the bugs (such as not being able to click anything in the cockpit upon loading it up) and the performance issues (only 50% gpu usage in the A320 cockpit, glass cockpits suffer hard on performance). The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally. The best place to test your performance is in a major city like JFK.

Overall, I'm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there. It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long time, I have hope that many of these issues will be fixed.",buy game recommend try xbox game pas get 1 month first month otherwise 6 month download xbox game pas also use downloaded file launcher steam version want go later sim fantastic feel well worth wait update full review later get hand experience simulator updated full review 2020 08 20 testing simulator fair bit time wanted give input feel simulator microsoft flight simulator graphically speaking simply best flight simulator longest time cloud rendered simulator like p3d x plane 11 2d flat albeit p3d truesky significantly improves cloud fs2020 finally able get overhaul one significant problem flight simulation weather system great flaw seen metar sometimes outdated 1 hour show weather representative weather actually certain airport sometimes significantly behind sometimes accurate weather currently airport hopefully time issue sorted weather provider meteoblue gust however great frequency shown able adjusted give wind alive feel aerodynamics improved day fsx p3d sims felt rail aerodynamics comparable x plane 11 feel better flight model though feel exaggerated flying third person camera however feel kind arcade like dislike enjoy flying cockpit flying third person camera feel aerodynamics need work done plane tend tail heavy experience pitching much upon touchdown biggest selling point game opinion use satellite imagery ai create autogen ground scenery best ever seen flight simulator date us bing map good google map opinion job well enough make realistic experience aircraft problem autopilot functioning correctly missing feature gps system g1000 make difficult near impossible fly network like pilotedge vatsim general performance issue look really nice greatest functionality default aircraft expected everything work however try make really good avionics kind like x plane 11 fully functional g1000 gns430 gns530 avionics system work really well included default payware plane end using default avionics strong base avionics must simulator opinion biggest problem simulator buggy unoptimized simulator feel simulator needed time ironed bug able click anything cockpit upon loading performance issue 50 gpu usage a320 cockpit glass cockpit suffer hard performance game really need beefy computer run optimally best place test performance major city like jfk overall enjoying simulator love fly around friend fseconomy flight enjoyable experience far team wanting support game long time hope many issue fixed

582660,Black Desert,"Alright, so I've played many MMORPGS/online service games from time to time. Genshin Impact, GW2, Warframe, Destiny 2, Neverwinter, ESO, New World, so I got the general idea around them. And somewhere along the way I'll try to provide comparison to Black Desert Online (BDO) so you'll have an insight. Here we go.

[h1] The Good Things [/h1]
Nice graphics. BDO got a remaster not too long ago, and it turned out pretty good. Even by today's standards. The environments, equipments, character models, they are all good. They really have a good graphics design team. Up-to-date-graphics with little hardware cost. Good job devs, on that one. Some other games are a bit less optimized (New World, Bless Online, looking at you both).

Fantastic combat. I like an RPG game where the combat represents what I wanna do. When I wanna move left, the character moves left. When I wanna move right, the character moves right. I don't stand in one place and pretend we fight like we're having a family argument. Whether we like it or not, those old style combat (tab-targeting or whatever) are severely outdated and unrealistic. While BDO's combat is not. It's impactful, responsive, flashy, and configurable. I dunno about you, but BDO kinda represents how I would like to actually fight in a fantasy world more than most MMOs. And I can still pull it off with just 10 fingers, a mouse, and a keyboard. No need to band-aid with gamepad. Just as it should be for a proper PC game.

Animations inside & outside of combat are done well enough. Although, it still needs more proper running, climbing, and interaction movements. Kinda feels clunky but is it the engine? And why do you WALK backwards too in-combat? You're in a battleground, not in your house. Is it a feature or a deliberately mistreated animation? So weird. But overall, it's still better than other games like GW2 or Neverwinter.

BDO also has a (seemingly) generous & steady flow of event/minigames/quest/etc rewards that players can get for free. So much, that I become really confused which one to take in first.

I also like the whole node systems. It kinda puts a lot more feature than just fighting enemies. You can craft stuff, cook stuff, manufacture stuff, and sell them for profit. You can basically make a trading network out of it. And it can raise your non-combat skills too (BDO calls it life skill). So those are what I like about the game in a way that it's got both style and depth in features. It's a lot of fun, but it has boundaries.

[h1] The Bad Things [/h1]
Like I said, so many rewards. Which means you're gonna need inventory space & item knowledge. Before you take one item, you gotta know EXACTLY what you're gonna use it for, and the corresponding NPCs that may be involved. You can't just leave it in your bag or even storage cuz it's gonna take too much space. So if you're a hoarder kind, just hold on & keep playing the game until you have enough space for everything you want. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad because the game only tells you very little about inventory management stuffs. Is it deliberate? Do they intentionally obscure the facts to mislead people into buying inventory spaces at the premium currency market? Beats me.

The combat progression in this game contains a rather obstructive RNG, namely the enhancement system. It's a bit...I dunno how to call it. Cheap? Lazy? Discouraging? To compare, in ESO, you can craft stuffs and already get better. In Warframe, yes you get stuffs by RNG but once you get it you can power it up however you like. In BDO, getting endgame equipments alone contains RNG, and then they added even MORE RNG to enhance it. I'd be fine if it's just about failing and succeeding. But in BDO when you fail to enhance, it's gonna reduce your equipment's durability or even destroy them. It's not even lore-friendly, I mean the game has blacksmiths so why not use them to enhance anyways? As the players, I need to admit that we all seem to be really, REALLY untalented at enhancing. We are supposed to be fighters by nature, not blacksmiths, oh and we already paid to play your game so we deserve a little help and compensation. Hear that, devs? Maybe, change the system a bit so you can have even more players?

Also, this may not be significant but with all due respects devs I personally find your game trailers and the trailer music really miss the mark. You use them for advertisement, yes? If so, then please show us more about the game. All I've seen from the trailer is combat. That's it. I don't get the point. Okay, those people are fighting, but then so what? Where are we going from there? Is this game a Dynasty Warriors simulator? Do you want it to be a Dynasty Warriors simulator? If not, then please put more context into them. Try to communicate better with the players/potential customers. Look how New World went down (as per 2021) just because they have no idea how players filter out their games. You've been here longer. You should know.

Oh and the trailer music. I'm really sorry to say this, but they suuuuuuck like hell. Please, use better ones. Just take the in-game musics and pick the one that has the PROPER mood to each trailer. Every time I watch your trailers, BDO, I'm always turned off. Plus the whole trailer-concept-doesn't-have-clear-context-thing. If you want the game to be successful, you have to present them the right way.

[h1] Conclusion, or TL;DR [/h1]
So for you guys out there who wants to play BDO, I suggest to play just to have enough harmless fun but beyond that, I you wanna go further and become a semi-veteran player, you have to prepare to have lots of time due to the heavy grind and RNG nature of this game. It's not for everyone, and there are currently obvious better choices than this (ESO, FFXIV from what I've heard, Warframe, Destiny 2 if you can ignore the scummy content scrapping stuff). I would say BDO is 7/10. This is some of the games I really hope to get better in 2022. If done right, BDO can become larger than Warframe or New World. Whether it happens or not will be up to the players and the devs.",alright played many mmorpgs online service game time time genshin impact gw2 warframe destiny 2 neverwinter eso new world got general idea around somewhere along way try provide comparison black desert online bdo insight go h1 good thing h1 nice graphic bdo got remaster long ago turned pretty good even today standard environment equipment character model good really good graphic design team date graphic little hardware cost good job devs one game bit le optimized new world bless online looking fantastic combat like rpg game combat represents wan na wan na move left character move left wan na move right character move right stand one place pretend fight like family argument whether like old style combat tab targeting whatever severely outdated unrealistic bdo combat impactful responsive flashy configurable dunno bdo kinda represents would like actually fight fantasy world mmos still pull 10 finger mouse keyboard need band aid gamepad proper pc game animation inside outside combat done well enough although still need proper running climbing interaction movement kinda feel clunky engine walk backwards combat battleground house feature deliberately mistreated animation weird overall still better game like gw2 neverwinter bdo also seemingly generous steady flow event minigames quest etc reward player get free much become really confused one take first also like whole node system kinda put lot feature fighting enemy craft stuff cook stuff manufacture stuff sell profit basically make trading network raise non combat skill bdo call life skill like game way got style depth feature lot fun boundary h1 bad thing h1 like said many reward mean gon na need inventory space item knowledge take one item got ta know exactly gon na use corresponding npc may involved leave bag even storage cuz gon na take much space hoarder kind hold keep playing game enough space everything want necessarily bad thing bad game tell little inventory management stuff deliberate intentionally obscure fact mislead people buying inventory space premium currency market beat combat progression game contains rather obstructive rng namely enhancement system bit dunno call cheap lazy discouraging compare eso craft stuff already get better warframe yes get stuff rng get power however like bdo getting endgame equipment alone contains rng added even rng enhance fine failing succeeding bdo fail enhance gon na reduce equipment durability even destroy even lore friendly mean game blacksmith use enhance anyways player need admit seem really really untalented enhancing supposed fighter nature blacksmith oh already paid play game deserve little help compensation hear devs maybe change system bit even player also may significant due respect devs personally find game trailer trailer music really miss mark use advertisement yes please show u game seen trailer combat get point okay people fighting going game dynasty warrior simulator want dynasty warrior simulator please put context try communicate better player potential customer look new world went per 2021 idea player filter game longer know oh trailer music really sorry say suuuuuuck like hell please use better one take game music pick one proper mood trailer every time watch trailer bdo always turned plus whole trailer concept clear context thing want game successful present right way h1 conclusion tl dr h1 guy want play bdo suggest play enough harmless fun beyond wan na go become semi veteran player prepare lot time due heavy grind rng nature game everyone currently obvious better choice eso ffxiv heard warframe destiny 2 ignore scummy content scrapping stuff would say bdo 7 10 game really hope get better 2022 done right bdo become larger warframe new world whether happens player devs

That being said, I very much enjoyed playing this game. I appreciate that I can pause the game in single player and take the time to set actions for everything before unpausing. The anomolies are fun to explore. Awakened empires were a pain in the beginning because the game doesn't warn you that out of a 200 year game, an empire will ""awaken"" within the last 30 years to absolutely dominate and ruin your game if you're not prepared. A warning or heads up for that would have been nice. I do wish the 10+ DLC's were not so expensive per piece. I'm not convinced to buy them unless they go on sale.

1158310,Crusader Kings III,"In the year 931, my sister and lover was murdered by my friend and brother-in-law. He burnt her at the stake with my babe in her belly. He was a powerful man, my sister married well, his family spread far across Europe with many of his kin in the most influential houses of the developed world. 

I spent the next 350 years erasing everyone who shared his blood, starting with my niece and nephews. By the time I was done, his family was erased from history, lost to obscurity and time. All my focus and hatred had left my own family nothing more than a poor Duke, so heavily consumed by a hate he didn't understand that by the time it was all over he took his own life before he fathered an heir. Thus, I lost my own family to obscurity and time.

After gaining nothing and losing everything I pondered for a moment whether or not it was all worth it... 

The next day I started a new campaign this time I would play properly, I would get it right...

238960,Path of Exile,"One of the best (and true to form) ""Free to Play"" games currerntly available.
Positives;
~ Monetization is 90% cosmetic, %10 item storage upgrades; Neither of which is an obvious ""Pay to Win"".
~ Near limitless replayability with Maps and character building
~ Extremely open-ended character building system. You are, in no way, restricted to any particular role or build with each starting class.
~ Crafting system is fairly robust.
~ Hideouts are a neat little private space and hobby.
~ ""Power creep"" does not really kick in until end-game (Maps, lv70+)
~ Boss fights are usually fairly well put together and the major attacks are telegraphed.
~ The Labyrinth is a neat system for checking one's build and is fun to explore.
~ Trade system is especially easy to get involved with. Their ""Public"" tabs automatically load things you place in them to a trade website, without you having to register or post them, yourself. The public market is fairly well established.
~ Leagues generally add an interesting mechanic of some sort. Popular mechanics are added to the ""Standard"" league and made a part of the core game.

Negatives;
~ The program is not the most well optimized and there may be some performance issues, but this seems to be less of a problem as time matches on.
~ Hideouts need an item cap higher than 750 items. (This is me nit-picking)

So, yeah, I would say that this game is plenty of fun to play and their business model is one of the most generous available.

[list]
      [*] [b]The community can be toxic as hell. There's three basic types of toxicity.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] New players who are uninformed (not your fault) who do things the community considers bad manners.
            [*] Experienced perfectionists.
            [*] People who enjoy other's suffering.

      [*] [b]Higher learning curve than some expect. [/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Learning survivor and killer perks is important regardless of what you main.
            [*] Common tactics to avoid getting downed or looped.
            [*] Prioritization/situational awareness. Where is everyone, what are they doing, what should you be doing?.
            [*] Community slang.
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired. [/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Inexperienced paired with experienced... but in a ""one gets dunked on"" arrangement, not teaching.

      [olist]
            [*] It takes 9000 iridescent shards, which are gained through leveling one's account up.
            [*] The Shrine of Secrets changes every week, and potentially has perks from DLC characters available.

      [*] [b]Friends not required but make experience better.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] No in-game voice chat for survivors, some use Discord instead. 
            [*] In-game emotes used to communicate, as well as crouching. 
            [*] Relatively easy to find new friends if you're nice, most people who play survivor want full SWF crews.

---------------------------------------

[h1]UPDATE (May 28 2021):[/h1]

[list]
      [*] [b]New content is still being released![/b]

      [olist]
            [*] More mechanics are being added to the game, which changes how survivors play. Ex: Zombies being added in the R.E. chapter (in Player Test Build at the time of this update). 
            [*] Some cosmetics can be purchased with shards, unlocked through game-play, or redeemed via codes released by BHVR.
            [*] Periodic events. Currently, there's an event to find Gnome Chompski once the exit gates are powered. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Map and graphical updates.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] The game generally looks a lot better now.
            [*] Multiple variants of maps.
            [*] Maps tend to be smaller now, which can be both good and bad. Gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]The Rift[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] A battle pass has been added to the game.
            [*] Auric cells (paid currency) are part of the reward system- if you complete the Rift you actually get your money back!
            [*] Players are rewarded with cosmetics, lore (The Archives), and various forms of in-game currency. 
            [*] Challenges from the Rift add an extra layer of fun (or psychological distress and anguish) to matches. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]Matchmaking... Again[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon/evening.
            [*] I'm a filthy survivor main heathen, so I can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon/evening. 
            [*] Still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair, but it's better than it used to be. 
            [*] There's a lot more player consistency in terms of skill, but also toxicity, in higher ranks. 
            [*] If you want to meme and enjoy, the higher ranks tend to be very serious... 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]HIT BOXES MAKE ME CRY.[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] This is just a game.
            [*] Please, self... It's just a game...
            [*] [i]Sobbing intensifies.[/i]
            [*] In all seriousness though, the hit boxes need some improvement. Lag, frame-perfect timing, and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face. 
            [*] I may be a survivor main, but if a Huntress nails me across the map, I'm impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer's behalf if it doesn't register. 
      [/olist]

      [*] [b]What accessibility options?[/b]

      [olist]
            [*] Changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences. 
            [*] An option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful. A fade-in, solid color, then fade-out screen aura might be a good option for this? It would preserve visual information without giving an 'unfair advantage' to players.
            [*] For the record, players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else. If your primary concern is giving players an 'unfair advantage,' please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set-back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field. 
      [/olist]
[/list]

[h1]I'd say that the changes boost my rating to a 9/10, but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2/10.[/h1]

To BHVR, if they ever stumble their way into this review: 
The new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes. Accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated [i]and[/i] it would increase audience reach and profitability. Keep up the good work.

- Crossplay, and a Free Edition (you can try) it will never run out of players to fight with.
- You can use Crystals to Protect you from pressure or use them to extend a combo in a case of need.
- Combos aren't really too long or hard to perform(there is a limit on how long they can be as well)
The pace is somewhere between Slow and Fast, specially if you like SF cause its a slow game or you like anime cause they are faster pace... this game falls right in the middle of both.
- 28Characters to pick from, its more than twice the amount that the 1st game started with!
- 2B from Nier Automata is comming as DLC!

How does this game feel?
- Its feels like Street Fighter, lots of foot work and less about jumping around like a mad lad as in anime games, but slightly faster paced compared to SF.
- Compared to the last version(non-rising), its a bit more faster now, with slightly more options to combo and Get'off'me solutions.
- Cast is very varied and different to play, hard to get bored
- Got bored of fighting? Go play some GrandBruise instead to relax!(if you cant find a match just switch to another server until you find one.
- You can also play solo in a peculiar and unique story mode, up to 2 players on screen co-op couch/online
- Art Style is very good, music is superb and mechanics aren't overwhelming and allow lots of options.

Any good characters to start the game with?
- Grand (ur typical Shoto/Ryu)
- Katalina ( Similar to grand but more Medium range pokes)
- Vira (get a grab or transform and rush down ur enemy in your shiny armor)
- Anila (fluff your opponents to death with your army of little sheeps)",pick game 1st fighting game newcomer fan streetfighter game easy input crossplay free edition try never run player fight use crystal protect pressure use extend combo case need combo really long hard perform limit long well pace somewhere slow fast specially like sf cause slow game like anime cause faster pace game fall right middle 28characters pick twice amount 1st game started 2b nier automaton comming dlc game feel feel like street fighter lot foot work le jumping around like mad lad anime game slightly faster paced compared sf compared last version non rising bit faster slightly option combo get solution cast varied different play hard get bored got bored fighting go play grandbruise instead relax cant find match switch another server find one also play solo peculiar unique story mode 2 player screen co op couch online art style good music superb mechanic overwhelming allow lot option good character start game grand ur typical shoto ryu katalina similar grand medium range poke vira get grab transform rush ur enemy shiny armor anila fluff opponent death army little sheep

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"Disclaimer:  I don't recommend this game for people in hectic households (toddler etc.) due to the lack of a pause function, or for people who are too busy to play for more than brief periods at a time.  The gameplay involves long periods of stalking and waiting and is more suitable for those who can spare 1-2+ hours of uninterrupted play time per session.

Furthermore, given the abundance of negative reviews reading some variation of, ""I ran around for hours and didn't see any animals, 0/10,"" I want to point out that this is a hunting simulator and not an action FPS.  The game models noise and scent as well as vision, and you are usually in pursuit of animals that have much better hearing and/or senses of smell than humans.  Running in the game is only suitable to get from point A to point B and should be avoided while actively hunting.  Walking through bushes and tall grass should also be avoided on hunts (although it's not too noisy on trails).  The animals will otherwise hear you coming and flee before you know they were there, and even if you spot their tracks you'll never catch them just by running after them.  

I have only played for 9 hours, but my player stats show that I have scared off via noise almost *600* animals.  I have only seen 40-50 so far.  The animals are there, you just aren't going to stumble across them while running around as if it were Skyrim.  The game requires long periods of slowly creeping around and sitting still in blinds or foliage using calls and peering through scopes or binoculars.  

Review:

As a person who has not only never gone hunting but never held an actual firearm in their 36 years of life, I bought this on sale just to see what it would be like.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The base game includes two large ""reserves"" (maps) to play on.  They are beautiful and populated with sufficient species to keep the hunt interesting for tens of hours if not longer.

Visually, the game makes good use of modern hardware and looks very pleasing.  It isn't next-gen level, but it looks great at 1080p with an RTX 2060s.  The animal models are perhaps the weak point here, as they could stand to be a little more detailed.  Their animation, however, is realistic and looks good.  

The audio in the game is fantastic.  Wear headphones and enjoy the realistic ambient sounds of nature.  Listen for the calls of animals and identify where they are (just as they're doing when you make noise).  The voice acting is limited but well done.

There is a rudimentary story implemented, but it functions as a series of challenges to complete in exchange for lump sums of experience and cash.  You can ignore them and will probably complete them organically in time as you play, or you can use them to get a feel for the gameplay and map layout.

There are functional RPG elements via a skills menu and a perks menu.  You acquire XP for killing animals, discovering landmarks and completing challenges.  You get one skill point or one perk point per level, alternating.  Skills vary from extremely useful (make less sound when you walk / steadier aim) to fun but unnecessary.  Most players will therefore likely wind up building their hunter along similar lines.  I feel that this is one area that could have been fleshed out a little more, but it's acceptable as-is.

The hunting gameplay seems realistic to me (as a non-hunter, so take that with a grain of salt).  Unlike a game like Skyrim, you won't stumble across animals every 50' the moment you walk off a trail.  You need to listen for their calls, use calls of your own to attract them, follow tracks and make use of ""need zones"" where animals congregate at certain times of the day to eat, drink or rest.  By default the game uses visual helpers like glowing tracks and call indicators to help you, but you can turn those off if you want the realism and challenge.  Note that this will invalidate some of the skill choices that adjust the indicators, so you'll want to build your hunter accordingly.

There is a lot of slowly creeping around and waiting.  Expect waits of 5, 10, 15 minutes or longer at times depending on your prey and the conditions of the hunt.  Going after elusive Diamond-rated animals can allegedly take over an hour real-time for some people.  If you enjoy stealth games and delayed gratification you'll feel right at home.  If you need constant action to stay immersed, perhaps give the game a pass.

Lastly, I want to address the DLC elephant in the room.  Yes, there are a lot of DLC, and yes they add up if you buy them all at full price.  Fortunately, the DLC are completely optional.  I bought the game on sale and picked up the well-reviewed Yukon and Tundra maps, and then later the Safari map (mixed reviews, but I want to experience an African map) with one gun pack and one lodge for a total equal to a lunch.  Not bad.  After reading descriptions and reviews I decided I didn't need any of the other DLC.  I say get the base game and maybe one map that really interests you and wait for a sale to grab anything else if you decide you like the game.  Overall the maps cost as much as a coffee and donut on sale (excepting the newest one, which is a bit pricier).

I haven't played multiplayer and recommend checking out other reviews to see how that's like.  I'm a singleplayer-only gamer.

Overall an experience that even a non-hunter like me finds enjoyable.  Relaxing and tranquil at times, tense and dramatic at others.  I wouldn't hurt a fly in real life, but after experiencing long hunts in this game and bagging a gold-rated deer or coyote, I think I understand better why real-life hunters enjoy hunting.  If you're a real hunter I think you'll enjoy the game even more than someone like me.  I've seen some positive reviews from actual hunters, but take a look for more if you're still on the fence.

9/10 game.  Surprise hit for me, having never played a hunting sim before.

UPDATE:  At almost 50 hours in I'm still finding this game to be engaging, which is more than can be said for a lot of games I've played.

2338770,NBA 2K24,"NBA 2K24, just like its predecessors, is a classic example of how a franchise can become stagnant, offering very little innovation year after year. As a PC and Steam player, my experience with this game has been nothing short of disappointing, plagued by inequality, mistreatment, bugs, and server issues. i think if me and my friends attempted to learn computer programming for two weeks we can come up with something better than this garbage. my park is completely unplayable and pay to win.

The biggest gripe I have with NBA 2K24 is the lack of innovation. It feels like I'm playing the same game as the previous versions with a fresh coat of paint. The gameplay mechanics, graphics, and animations hardly seem to have evolved since the last installment. It's disheartening to see a franchise with such potential stuck in a never-ending cycle of repetition.

On top of that, PC and Steam players are often treated as second-class citizens in the NBA 2K community. Console players receive updates and content much earlier, leaving PC players in the dust. It's frustrating to see this level of inequality, especially when we're expected to pay the same price for the game.

Bugs and glitches have been a long-standing issue in the NBA 2K series, and NBA 2K24 is no exception. The game is riddled with numerous bugs that can significantly impact the gameplay experience. From AI issues to game-breaking glitches, it's clear that quality assurance is not a priority for the developers.

The servers in NBA 2K24 are yet another source of frustration. Frequent server outages and lag spikes make online play an exercise in patience. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and money into a game only to be constantly reminded of its technical shortcomings.

In summary, NBA 2K24 continues the unfortunate trend of offering little innovation while perpetuating inequality and mistreatment towards PC and Steam players. The prevalence of bugs and server issues only adds insult to injury. It's high time the developers take a long, hard look at their franchise and start delivering a truly fresh and engaging basketball experience, rather than repackaging the same game year after year.",nba 2k24 like predecessor classic example franchise become stagnant offering little innovation year year pc steam player experience game nothing short disappointing plagued inequality mistreatment bug server issue think friend attempted learn computer programming two week come something better garbage park completely unplayable pay win biggest gripe nba 2k24 lack innovation feel like playing game previous version fresh coat paint gameplay mechanic graphic animation hardly seem evolved since last installment disheartening see franchise potential stuck never ending cycle repetition top pc steam player often treated second class citizen nba 2k community console player receive update content much earlier leaving pc player dust frustrating see level inequality especially expected pay price game bug glitch long standing issue nba 2k series nba 2k24 exception game riddled numerous bug significantly impact gameplay experience ai issue game breaking glitch clear quality assurance priority developer server nba 2k24 yet another source frustration frequent server outage lag spike make online play exercise patience incredibly frustrating invest time money game constantly reminded technical shortcoming summary nba 2k24 continues unfortunate trend offering little innovation perpetuating inequality mistreatment towards pc steam player prevalence bug server issue add insult injury high time developer take long hard look franchise start delivering truly fresh engaging basketball experience rather repackaging game year year

414340,Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,"Hi, friends. This is gonna be a long one.
I don't often review games nor do I often feel the need to review games. But with Senua's Sacrifice I felt like I just had no choice. I was tempted to just leave a joke review, something like, ""average day with ADHD"", but Senua's deserves more than that.
I first bought this game three years ago on my Xbox One. Funnily enough my therapist, who's big into story games, is the one who recommended this to me. I'm a person who's dealt with schizophrenia for around 7 years at this point-- I'm 19 now, so if you can imagine a 12 year old trying to deal with that then you can try and sympathize. I wish there was more to say about it other than that I just woke up with it one day and it hasn't gone away since. It felt catastrophic at first. I felt like I could never know what was real-- like I never knew if I was still dreaming or not. That's probably the best way to put it. I was balancing my middle school and high school years with trying to cope with what felt like an undeserved punishment from God. Or that, there couldn't possibly be a God who would thrust this upon a child. But it got better. I got medicated, and with a lot of trial and error (and even more self-acceptance), I've gotten to a point in my life where I feel like it doesn't affect me. It comes in waves and now, thankfully, most of the time I'm all good. I haven't had a harmful episode in about two years, and with continued support from my psychiatrist and therapist, I know I will be able to live the rest of my (hopefully) many years on this planet. I'm at peace with myself, or at least I think.

I bought Senua's Sacrifice three years ago, like I said. This was immediately following a pretty bad episode that led to a lot of discord in my family. A few of my ties with family members were really strained and they still haven't really healed yet. I had gotten on new medication and it helped tremendously. I didn't know much about Senua's when I bought it-- all I knew was that it was meant to represent what having schizophrenia was like, or something like that. My therapist thought that it might help me deal with what I was feeling at the time, knowing that games can be a good escape from reality. So, I opened the game and sat through the opening scene, where Senua is in the boat. Or at least, I tried to. After most of the way through, I had tears welling up in my eyes and I felt my heart beating out of my chest. I threw my headphones off and cried in my bed for half an hour. I couldn't stop thinking about the voices in the game: ""Go back!"", and ""What is she doing?"" kept ringing in my head. Those two lines really hit close to home. After I pulled myself back together, I shut the game off and forgot about it to play some more Overwatch. I tried my very hardest to completely forget about Senua's Sacrifice.

Fast forward a year later and I'm scrolling through my Xbox library and find Senua's eyes staring at me from the menu. I was hit with the memories of her voices talking to you through the screen and felt like crying again. But it had been a year, and I thought I was ready. So, I started the game back up and managed to get through the opening scene without freaking out. But that was where it stopped-- the tears came back in full effect once she got off the log raft. But that didn't stop me from playing. I kept through the tutorial area with tears in my eyes, but fully invested in the game. I knew the voices weren't mine, as much as they sounded like it. I knew they were Senua's, and I wanted to be here to experience them for her. Honestly, I played through the game with tears in my eyes for most of it. I had never in my life felt so connected to a game before. Every voice, every doubt, every encouragement-- I felt it deep in my soul. While obviously I can't speak for every schizophrenic person, and while the game certainly stylizes some things for the sake of gameplay: this game is a heart-rending masterpiece, a melancholic and beautiful representation of something I've lived with for so long. And I hope other people who live with schizophrenia will play this game, if they can get past the very triggering aspects that it certainly does have. Thank you, Ninja Theory, for creating something that so masterfully represents a thing that almost no one can explain.
[b] And for any schizophrenic person who's reading this, whoever you are, do not forget about your support system. I know it is easy to forget them when you're having an episode, so write it down somewhere you'll see every day. There are people who love you and will treat you as a person no matter how you might sound to them. And they will be there for you, whether or not you know you need it. [/b]

In summary, please buy this game. I bought it on Steam just so I could experience it again with the new graphical update. Senua's Sacrifice is an experience everyone needs to have-- even, and perhaps especially, those who don't experience psychosis.

294100,RimWorld,"[b] I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ...	[/b]

So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.
Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.

As if ...

Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz.
The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way.

[i] But then came the tortoise.	[/i]

Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise. [b] Nope!	[/b] I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest.
At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him. Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on.
But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again.
While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both. Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement.
In the end it was all too much.
Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries. Rain started falling down, putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first, Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.
Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it.

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"Backstory: In 1987, I began using MS Flight sim on an amber-screened IBM clone. It took several 'disks' to load, and I'd go make coffee and drink the majority of it before it was loaded and ready to play. In retrospect, it was simply atrocious. It had no graphics, ran at less than 5 frames per second, and took input from the keyboard. In a nutshell, it was like flying a very stubborn turkey.

But I was sucked in. ""One day, I thought, this will be real. One day, places will appear as they do in the real world. One day, planes will actually feel like planes, rather than just an illusion of something clearly tortured on a screen.

'One day,' 37 years later, has arrived.

I can find minor flaws in this game, such as the fact that the frame rate is inconsistent and slows significantly around densely populated areas, or that the drone camera system is somewhat cumbersome, and flight planning could be a lot more user friendly when adding or re-ordering waypoints. However, these are minor issues. And, while I'm sure they'll be fixed, I could live with the game as is because everything else is so far ahead of anything else I've ever seen. It's not just good; it's phenomenal.

I've been a hopeless pilot for years, doing my best and still failing miserably. However, this simulator is a quantum leap beyond the previous ones. When realism is set to maximum, I can land every time without crashing. The simulation of flight systems and avionics has vastly improved, making hand flying aircraft far easier than in previous iterations. It feels like you're flying a real plane, not a simulation. Flying over your hometown gives you the impression that you are actually there. (And no, the house you're flying into is nothing like your actual home. It could even be mine.)

Sometimes a product comes along that completely changes the genre. This will forever alter flight simulation. This is revolutionary.

So seeing this delivered before I get to go to that big refrigerator in the sky makes me ecstatic. It gives me great pleasure to say, ""It's finally here, and it's better than I could have imagined possible.""

I'm not going to complain about anything when I can fly anywhere in a faithfully recreated virtual copy of the world for $60. Fly over a location and exclaim, ""This looks exactly like it does in real life!"" What an ungrateful person I would be. If I complained about the hours and hours it took to download when, at the end of it, the entire world exists on a small setup in the corner of my living room. Some people, to be honest.

1599340,Lost Ark,"I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did. Got perma-banned for ""cheating"", tried to dispute it, they wouldn't tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don't even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I've just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins.

The fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game. If anything, THEY are the ones committing fraud, not me... It makes me really sad because I only got to enjoy having my character wear a cute pink swimsuit for a couple of days. :(

Also this game is not friendly to new players (hell, I've heard even new players are getting banned for no reason). I have a lot of hours, but I didn't play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now. The beginner areas are all full of bots and some co-op quests that new players need to do are all devoid of any players. (Gesbroy is the worst),

Thanks AGS for robbing me of my money and my happiness. It sucks that they're the publishers because the game itself is really great. The graphics are nice, I generally enjoyed the story line, and was enjoying the horizontal gameplay (mokoko hunting is the most satisfying thing). It's just sad that this is happening to innocent players.

This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.


EDIT: 1000 hours later re-review (2,123 hours at the time of edit)

This game STILL stands as one of the best games I've played to date. 

Journey's End (update 1.4) was a great update, although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progression, it revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game, (ex: bloodmoon fishing, town rework, new mushroom biomes, summoning rework, etc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4, which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfed, but still very good. On the other hand, a lot of niche/""bad"" items were reworked or buffed, making them on par (or better) compared to many other items. 

It would also be a crime to not mention the modding scene for this game. If you buy this game, do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steam, because oh my, there are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet), but is still a massive blast and a great experience.


Some mods I would heavily recommend are:

Split
     This mod is my favorite so far, prioritizing quality over content. Everything in this mod is
     very well made.

Calamity
     The most popular mod by far, has an AMAZING soundtrack composed by DMDokuro,
     definitely check out their other work. (and don't forget the music is a separate mod!)
     Play this mod on expert mode with revengeance rune active for the intended experience!

Thorium
     This mod adds a musical bard class that buffs you and your allies, so definitely play this
     one with a squad for the best experience.

Fargo's mods
     This group of mods adds an 'eternity mode' that will truly unleash hell upon your world,
     and I don't mean more health and damage for enemies, I'm talking unique mechanics.
     Changes to all of the bosses AI and some normal enemy AI makes them feel fresh again, 
     the enchantment accessories you can make, and 3 town npcs that you fight as bosses 
     later on (they are seriously well done). You will die a lot, so have patience.

Terraria Overhaul
     This mod doesn't add much in the way of items or bosses at all, however, it will make
     Terraria a much different experience. You might not like a lot of what this mod has to offer,
     and a lot of mechanics can be disabled in the settings, but at least give it a try.

Polarities
     Polarities is sadly a mod that only works in singleplayer, but what it has to offer in return is 
     an amazing experience. New biomes, bosses, enemies, items, a few new mechanics, and 
     another dimension you can travel to (that can lead to some very interesting sequence
     breaking in terms of progression), there is a lot this mod has to offer. Definitely give it a try.

and do not forget to get a variety of QoL mods to help you out (1.4 doors, boss checklist, etc.)


Edit 2: more mods to check out (i'll add descriptions later)! (Vanilla hours: 2262; TModloader Hours: 462+ however many i had before it went on steam)

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"Even getting this game for free, because somebody bought it for me... this is such a disappointment. Allow me to list my frustrations with this game, and the company who made it.

First and foremost, this game was announced as being free for anybody who bought the first Ark. Then that promise was taken back, we complained, and then the price was increased. What absolute insanity is that?

Second: I am an IT technician as my job. My job experience shouldn't be a requirement to get double digit frame rates. What is the point of a UE5 release that runs WORSE than the UE4? I shouldn't have to put console commands in to disable things like the Volumetric clouds or water reflections. Those can be GUI options, as opposed to being soft-locked into a powerpoint presentation unless the average person looks up these optimizations.

Third: Speaking of optimization... I think Studio Wildcard needs to go work for Blizzard and Activision. This is roughly an 80 gigabyte game, and that by itself is no big deal. Can anybody explain to me why two days in a row, I've had to patch the game with an 80 gigabyte patch? Are they developing each patch from scratch? Are they trying to 'create a new game' from the ground up, every time they find something to fix? 

'Oh! Hey, John... I found a small math error in the spawn algorithm' -Hapless employee.
'Start development over then. Do your job better.' -John, presumably the manager.

Forth: Minor points here, but some of these really, REALLY bother me. Everything in the game has shifted in the color scheme, it used to be a fantasy wilderness that wasn't too special. It sort of hit the feeling of 'I have no complaints, or praise. This is functional.' Now? Everything is tinted with a 'Press + to Defecate' color. Also, there was a decent balance of 'wilderness' and 'video game' in the UE4 version of Ark. What do I mean by this? One word: Vegetation.

Forth-point-five: Vegetation. Plants. Shrubs. EVERY SINGLE PATCH OF GRASS CAN BE LOOTED FOR FIBER. Now I know what you're thinking, 'Bob... how is MORE lootables bad? Isn't that more materials to use?' Yes, you're partially correct, it is more materials to use... but this 'Press E to gather plant fiber' crap that is everywhere, even on top of the resource caves underwater. It just makes herbivores or fiber gathering animals a pain in the ass. This problem is minor, I know, but Ark already had a problem with Fiber and it being one of the most abundant things, and now it's actual a problem.

Fifth: Deva Vu. I'm willing to go back and update this review if I end up being wrong, but I'm calling it. All the DLC's will be re-released and Wildcard will most likely expect us to pay for them again. I take back my earlier statement though, Wildcard should apply at Bethesda. They make barely functional games, which end up being good RPG's, and the constant re-releasing of old content and making people pay for it again.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"Medieval Dynasty puts you as a new arrived peasant in a valley. You'll need to survive, hunt, craft and build buildings to form a village that you manage and expand.

It's not so much a survival game, survival is only a thing in the first few hours and not really difficult. It becomes a village builder quickly and finally a management game.

It is a very beautiful and peaceful experience. Aside from a few bandits and aggresive animals, there's no combat. 

That means it is also a very relaxing experience. You can play at your own speed, the game is highly customizable if you dislike something (e.g. unlimited carry, faster/slower leveling, no hunger/thirst/stamina, easier or harder enemies etc.)

Also, it is still in development with cooperative multiplayer around the corner. 

Highly recommended.

1938090,Call of Duty®,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE. 

The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions. 

You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

+ Absolutely breathtaking visuals
+ Outstanding voice-acting & facial animations
+ Combat is simple & straightforward without a lot of gimmicks; the game gives you the tools you need from the beginning of the game & really doesn't change them, but works around what you've been given to increase the challenge as you progress
+ Two of the three boss battles (not including Hela) are excellent & challenging; Surtr was perhaps a little too easy & Fenrir was extremely challenging but fair (fans of Monster Hunter or Dark Souls would probably feel right at home with that one)
+ Devs kept mechanics simple & were careful to give you an enriching experience without too much baggage; the complete absence of things like inventory, usable items, & non-narrative character progression would seriously hurt most other games of the genre, but really holds the game up in this case
+ Intensely atmospheric, often unsettling, & not without a bevy of very effective emotional moments
+ Is very creative & participative in the way it handles such a complex & delicate subject as mental illness; I'm a health care professional & I can say this was spot on in my experiences (I felt more affected by this game with a good pair of headphones than I did running simulations in school for things like voice-hearing, for example)
+ Game was admittedly short, but well-paced & I felt I got my money's-worth
+ Blessedly short load-times, although some of this may come down to the hardware you're using
+ The ""collectible"" lore stones were engrossing to say the least; I really appreciated a gifted voice-actor/storyteller filling the player in on Norse mythology & I was eager to find them
+ Puzzles were creative & fairly straightforward without being too easy
+ Some of the challenges & environments in the game (most notably the Shard Trials) were extremely inventive in their presentation

- Even though this game has gone through a few patches & hot-fixes from its release, I still had about two or three instances of puzzles being bugged, forcing a restart of the section I was in
- The ending left me slightly dissatisfied, although it wasn't terrible: Senua's story was technically resolved, although the implications were a little vague & I desperately wanted to know what became of her after (felt like sequel-bait in some ways, though I have trouble picturing what an actual sequel would look like, if that makes sense)

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"Chants of Sennaar is a charming point-and-click puzzle game focusing on communicating and deciphering language. You started with knowing nothing about the languages. Slowly, you will learn the words by observing and communicating with the people and places around you.

Positives:
+ Unique take on detective/puzzle game. 
During the game, you will find several languages to understand. Each language may have its own grammar and rules. For example, one language may repeat a word to convey the amount (e.g. book-book), while another may have a plural marker (e.g. many book). Within the language, some words are related to each other and you can infer that logically as well. Finally, you might also be asked to translate between languages! Solving for those are such a delight.
+ Well-designed checkpoint system for stealth sections.
This game has a lot of stealth sections, which do feels completely separate from the puzzle part. However, if you do fail during the stealth section, most of the time the game will return you to the middle of it instead of having you start over. This makes it easy to do those sections, as failing means only a little setback, especially if you are more fond of the puzzle part than the stealth part.

Neutral:
* The glyph validation system. 
The character will draw in their journal of pictures connected to the meaning of the glyph. 
This system provides two things: 1. you know that you already found the glyphs (the character, not necessarily the meaning) for those things; and 2. you can get the answer by brute forcing the glyphs. 
In my opinion, try to avoid validating the glyphs unless you know for sure the meaning of the glyph as it takes a lot of the fun when you rely on it to get the meaning of the glyph.

Negatives:
- A lot of waiting for the character to walk around
The environment in Chants of Sennaar are huge and grand. While great and immersive when you got to see them for the first time, this game requires a lot of backtracking. Since you are learning the languages while going through the levels, there are a lot of moments where you need to go back and get more information in the prior section with your newfound knowledge. This means a lot of walking and a lot of waiting.
- Weak later parts of the game
The later parts of the game are a bit weak compared to the rest of the game. In those sections, it's a lot easier to validate your glyphs even without you guessing them yourselves. This is a bit of a shame since one of the later languages shows how concepts could be merged into a new glyphs.

Overall, I do recommend Chants of Sennaar for those who like puzzle/detective-style game who seek something unique from the genre.",chant sennaar charming point click puzzle game focusing communicating deciphering language started knowing nothing language slowly learn word observing communicating people place around positive unique take detective puzzle game game find several language understand language may grammar rule example one language may repeat word convey amount e g book book another may plural marker e g many book within language word related infer logically well finally might also asked translate language solving delight well designed checkpoint system stealth section game lot stealth section feel completely separate puzzle part however fail stealth section time game return middle instead start make easy section failing mean little setback especially fond puzzle part stealth part neutral glyph validation system character draw journal picture connected meaning glyph system provides two thing 1 know already found glyph character necessarily meaning thing 2 get answer brute forcing glyph opinion try avoid validating glyph unless know sure meaning glyph take lot fun rely get meaning glyph negative lot waiting character walk around environment chant sennaar huge grand great immersive got see first time game requires lot backtracking since learning language going level lot moment need go back get information prior section newfound knowledge mean lot walking lot waiting weak later part game later part game bit weak compared rest game section lot easier validate glyph even without guessing bit shame since one later language show concept could merged new glyph overall recommend chant sennaar like puzzle detective style game seek something unique genre

1063730,New World,"EDIT:
Since the community is finding the review helpful I thought to make it justice and update with the new developments and also re-structure the original one to a more easy-to-read and eye-friendly one.

So, on the 18th of December (day that I started my holidays) I logged-in to the surprise of being greeted by a permanent ban for ""Disruptive behaviour"". A bit shocked by the message I clicked on the ""appeal the ban"" link.

My message was short and straight to the point. The ban did not make any sense and I requested some information as to why in this world I would get such ban (disruptive) when out of the large amount of hours I had played to that moment, the vast majority was invested in farming PvE in order to grind the famous ""watermark system"" and get some nice loot for later Pvping.

Minutes later I got an email which at the beginning I thought it was automated (due to it being quick) but I was wrong. It was a copy/paste that could not be meant for me as it stated the following:
 ""The previous agent provided you already of all the available information"" 
and 
""We're always happy to help if you have any other questions, however we do not have further insight to provide and further inquiries on this matter will not receive a response.""

Took a minute or five to try and digest such email and I proceeded to contact AGS customer service chat and simultaneously appeal again letting them know that there was not a previous agent that provided me any information.

As I was diving in an interesting (sarcasm) conversation with the chat agent where he could not give me any information as he claimed that ""only moderators have access to that information"" I did receive the automate email that you can find screenshots on the internet. Basically says that the ban is merited and that they can't share information so they won't reply any further emails.

I decided to provide some feedback to the guy on the chat about the service and he assured me he would pass it along for which I received an email from ""Krishna a specialist From Amazon Game Studios"". Next level specialist as the email contained just links to amazon website to the different sections such as help, general questions, your account, contact-us. But there was one sentence that was different:
""Please wait for further communication from moderation the team.""

So, as it was close to holidays I did not expect any reply and I used it to exercise my GDPR right and ask for my data. Just to see if I could find any information in there. Which I did. One of the documents called ""AmazonGames.Moderation.Penalties.csv"" contained my alleged ""merited ban"" information with... no information. The penaltyContext column states ""N/A"".

It has been two weeks since their last email asking me to wait for further communication and as I suspected, no communication has been made. Now I am wondering if I should bother in appeal again or straight write a formal complain to amazon complaints email address stating my case and how incompetent their AGS customer service is.

As in my original review, I still think I got mass reported by some company that got mad in Outpost Rush game mode. 

I haven't only pre-ordered the game and played the 2 betas but also gifted the game to friends, brought other friends from different games to play with me and bought their premium currency as I really wanted to support the project and see the game succeed.

Unfortunately, due to the given situation, and even overlooking all the flaws, bugs and other problems stated in many other reviews, I cannot recommend anyone to give them money and buy their product unless you are aware and consent to be disrupted of a service you paid for for no reason with no warnings or communication from their part.

Peace

ORIGINAL:
Permabanned for no apparent reason. Appeal automatic answer says they cannot disclose any information and to not contact them back. I am inclined to believe I got mass reported by some company that got mad in the game mode Outpost Rush. I have over 1000 hours game play which the vast majority of it I invested in farming watermark and gear to finally do some PvP. I started doing PvP in OPR last week and I lasted less than a week. Beware if you are into PvPing it can lead to your account being banned if you are disliked by any company/company member that you can repeatedly kill. AGS customer services is the poorest I have ever came across with. No line of contact, just an automatic message where they state they refuse to give you information about it and that they will not reply your messages.",edit since community finding review helpful thought make justice update new development also structure original one easy read eye friendly one 18th december day started holiday logged surprise greeted permanent ban disruptive behaviour bit shocked message clicked appeal ban link message short straight point ban make sense requested information world would get ban disruptive large amount hour played moment vast majority invested farming pve order grind famous watermark system get nice loot later pvping minute later got email beginning thought automated due quick wrong copy paste could meant stated following previous agent provided already available information always happy help question however insight provide inquiry matter receive response took minute five try digest email proceeded contact ag customer service chat simultaneously appeal letting know previous agent provided information diving interesting sarcasm conversation chat agent could give information claimed moderator access information receive automate email find screenshots internet basically say ban merited share information reply email decided provide feedback guy chat service assured would pas along received email krishna specialist amazon game studio next level specialist email contained link amazon website different section help general question account contact u one sentence different please wait communication moderation team close holiday expect reply used exercise gdpr right ask data see could find information one document called amazongames moderation penalty csv contained alleged merited ban information information penaltycontext column state n two week since last email asking wait communication suspected communication made wondering bother appeal straight write formal complain amazon complaint email address stating case incompetent ag customer service original review still think got mass reported company got mad outpost rush game mode pre ordered game played 2 beta also gifted game friend brought friend different game play bought premium currency really wanted support project see game succeed unfortunately due given situation even overlooking flaw bug problem stated many review recommend anyone give money buy product unless aware consent disrupted service paid reason warning communication part peace original permabanned apparent reason appeal automatic answer say disclose information contact back inclined believe got mass reported company got mad game mode outpost rush 1000 hour game play vast majority invested farming watermark gear finally pvp started pvp opr last week lasted le week beware pvping lead account banned disliked company company member repeatedly kill ag customer service poorest ever came across line contact automatic message state refuse give information reply message

2141910,Magic: The Gathering Arena,"MTG is hands down one of the greatest card games ever created(but it hasn't been doing so well lately.) I installed the Steam version just long enough to give a review for those that happen to find this, but I have probably around 1K hours in MTG Arena played lifetime. I had even more hours in Magic Online, and a zillion times that IRL, haha! Regardless I'll stick to just talking about MTG Arena since that is what I am reviewing here:

I've been playing since Beta and used to be a regular PT grinder. While the glory days are long behind us MTG Arena gives us a simple way to play from home or our mobile devices. The smooth looking playing field, and things all happen easily and automatically. Despite this I really can't recommend MTG Arena as it's way too predatory, expensive, grindy, and somewhat rigged. (I explain this towards the end.)

-Unbelievably expensive if you aren't already a top tier player who has at least a few hours a day to grind out a draft or two(assuming you even like drafting, which luckily I do.) I can't imagine what a new player is expected to dole out to attempt to enjoy anything here without being slaughtered by those who play all day or spent thousands.
-Grinding out ""win"" quests takes forever for a menial gold reward.
-Modern crossover sets aren't as interesting as older sets that take place in the MTG universe. A crutch and a constant cash grab are now a permanent part of the game. Not every cross over will be interesting or mesh at all with the previous one.
-The game suffers from brutal power-creep and the more modern value-creep. This is what basically killed standard.
-Getting a high rank just means you get a few extra free booster packs at the end of the month. Big whoop!
-Best of one is a lame way to play the game, and basically overly rewards playing aggro and going first. Most formats are best of one.
-No social engagement at all. You're as isolated to yourself as possible. Every opponent is just some random screen name with an avatar and a pet you've seen 100 times. Where is ""the gathering"" part!?
-Can't play any custom rule sets or any way you want. For example once Pauper is gone, it's gone until they decide to bring it back.

Now the final issue: The ""rigged"" factor.

A lot of people complain by saying it's ""rigged"" but they never exactly explain HOW it's rigged. It's mostly just people who recognize something is very off with MTG Arena compared to Magic Online or IRL magic. This is interesting, because the other online Magic the Gathering game doesn't have this issue! Magic Online is very old and plays like old accounting software where the economy is ruined(I mean run) by bots. (Don't play MODO either, it sucks in a whole other way, although it is a zillion times less expensive.)

The problem here is understanding how it's ""rigged"" and why this manifests itself in such a way. To understand this we must understand how MTG Arena works:

-You must understand how EOMM match making works. A 50% win/loss ratio is scientifically proven to cause higher consistent player retention and therefore create more possible revenue. Also consider increased time played increases the sunken cost fallacy of time spent on the game which therefore causes players to stick to just the game they spent the most money on. EOMM basically works on the same principle that the ""near miss"" trick that carnival games use, or those ""snip the wire, or stack the blocks"" arcade type games. Near misses cause retention to try one more time since you were ""oh so close!""
-If you win a lot it will try to adjust your win rate by making you go second more often. On my quest for rank 1 mythic, when I finally achieved this I was going first around ~36% of the time.
-It tracks ""deck strength"" and tries to match you up against a deck of similar ""strength"", but this is very subjective and once you get ""bubbled"" as ""Good against Mono Red"" you'll NEVER play against that deck again. You never want to get ""bubbled"" as ""Bad against X"" since that's where you will get matched up with and you will need to adjust to cover your weakness. The best decks therefore either have low ""apparent"" deck strength, but high ""actual"" deck strength, or are adaptable to various scenarios. (For example, it doesn't consider your sideboard for upfront deck strength so ""wishing"" for cards in your sideboard gets around the deck based portion of the upfront deck strength calculation. Just keep in mind you will still get ""bubbled"" ""good against deck X"" if you beat the same deck over and over.)
-When playing draft make sure to also consider which cards the game considers ""high deck strength cards"" probably based on that cards win rate across all draft decks it's in. So a somewhat powerful rare/mythic creature that is splashable in your deck may not be worth taking since your deck strength will increase significantly which will in turn increase the average power level of decks you'll be matched up against(and they will also likely have just as many rares or mythic rares as you do!) Since you can't guarantee you will draw that card every game to combat this, it often times makes it not worth it to take! Instead consider a common or uncommon that is also powerful, but keeps your draft deck as ""low deck strength"" as possible. You also have to consider how often other people draft a card and actually win with it. There are a lot of undervalued rare/mythic cards that are good, but people never play them and don't actually win with them; therefore, they actually have low deck strength. Abusing this knowledge leads to much easier and consistent wins... which leads me to my final section of this review:

Now you know the rules(and so do I.) How to use all this to your advantage:

-Make sure you build decks that go second well and mulligan well once you're deep in going second almost every game territory. Consistency becomes key! If your opponent always goes first but has to mulligan it's no longer a default ""~60%-~40%"" in their favor! For draft this means defensive cards for the early game, and card draw becomes more valuable for the decks you play. As well as cards that can ""turn around"" a game!
-Consider whether a card is worth taking not only for how good it is, but consider how much it will increase your upfront deck strength value. No reason to take a card that you'll draw a few games to be forced to play against better decks EVERY game!
-In constructed including certain ""hoser/hate"" cards can altogether stop certain match-ups from appearing. This is insanely effective if they are main deck, but you can be tricky and get them from outside the game(wishes) since the upfront deck strength does not see cards in your sideboard. You can then alter your sideboard once those decks stop appearing and focus on the match ups you are now seeing!
-Keep track of which decks you play, and what ""bubbles"" MTG Arena has likely marked on those decks. Does your mono white deck stop mono red? Make sure to note it likely has ""Good against red/mono red decks"" meaning you can focus alterations to it towards other decks.
-Regardless of all this in best of one aggro is still king. A smooth well balanced ""secretly"" low deck strength aggro deck will always come out a winner over every other deck archetype.

Finally, always remember:

-Skill still matters. I can't tell you how many games people ""should"" have won, but they just screw it all up and lose. Every draft of MTG Arena I win at least one game where I should of been dead years ago, but they just keep making mistakes until I win(even in the higher ranks.)

I hope this review was worth your time to read! Go on and adventure forth! I recommend playing Magic the Gathering in real life with friends as that is the best way to play the game, and feel free to play the format or way YOU want! MTG Arena will never fulfill any of that unfortunately.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"If you're not familiar with the Monster Hunter franchise, this review might be for you:

The game starts of by looking like a convoluted mess to you. You pick your character and your cat buddy and next thing you know is you get thrown onto a massive walking volcano. 

When reaching the main hub - while still confused about the start of your journey - you will be overwhelmed by a lot of choices and stuff that's part of the game: 14 different weapons - each with its own playstyle - tons of collectibles, craftable stuff, ammunition, potions, powders, bugs, plants, ... the list just goes on and doesn't seem to finish.

Then there are main quests, side quests, event quests, special assignments to take part in.

After picking a mission, you get thrown into the land and have to find out how stuff works, there's little to no explanation. You get some sort of a visualized guide by flies that show you the correct path - but they will confuse you sooner or later.

When fighting a monster - while still not knowing how to fight due to the lack of tutorials - you might die a lot.
Now this is the part that will either break you or where the game finally clicks. 

I stopped playing twice and didn't think I'd pick it up; because of the tough fights that didn't seem to make sense to me and because of the collect-athon that just confused the heck out of me.
Well, I'm now close to 140h into the game and can't wait for the Iceborne expansion.

What more can I say... the game made me want to play on and on and on at one point. The fights were challenging and the moment the monster got caught or died was super satisfying and made you want to go for ""just one more Monster before I quit"".

I definitely recommend this game and urge you to give this game one, maybe two chances when you think ""No, this is not for me."" It most definitely is!",familiar monster hunter franchise review might game start looking like convoluted mess pick character cat buddy next thing know get thrown onto massive walking volcano reaching main hub still confused start journey overwhelmed lot choice stuff part game 14 different weapon playstyle ton collectible craftable stuff ammunition potion powder bug plant list go seem finish main quest side quest event quest special assignment take part picking mission get thrown land find stuff work little explanation get sort visualized guide fly show correct path confuse sooner later fighting monster still knowing fight due lack tutorial might die lot part either break game finally click stopped playing twice think pick tough fight seem make sense collect athon confused heck well close 140h game wait iceborne expansion say game made want play one point fight challenging moment monster got caught died super satisfying made want go one monster quit definitely recommend game urge give game one maybe two chance think definitely

1250410,Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition,"I'm a sport pilot so fly in real life, here's what I can tell everyone else about VR and MSFS2020.  Using a reverb G2 and flight yoke and throttle.

1) It easy to complain.... this building does not belong here, or it has to many levels, or my airport is not depicted just right - but when you step back and look at the big picture this is a gigantic leap forward for flight simmers.

2) I fly VFR in real life and mostly public airports, I can tell you that the at times tonight for moments I literally lost reality and felt like I was flying in real life, the sim can be that realistic, of course the wind, noise, and vibrations-turbulence are missing from the feedback, but in VR it immerses the senses even more making those points above even less noticeable while flying.

3) I am amazed how good VR is, how good the sim is compared to real life and again while it would be easy to complain about various things - wow a jump forward for flight simmers! There are times while in the traffic pattern I'll turn downwind, base, or on final and look down and out the window and I get that same feeling as real flying, I literally forget I'm in the sim because the terrain and building match up close enough to trick the mind. Performance wise it may be running better in VR than on my triple screens, still to be determined.


Some things I would like to see improved:

- Load the obstacles databases so that we have radio and water towers where they should be at the proper heights.

- Maybe this already exists but need the ability to turn off road car decals - those have never appealed to me

- Runway lights in the middle of many airport taxiways

- Multiple ATC voice change options

- Better data for the smaller airports, many have hangers, FBO's, or other vital landmarks missing. Example at airport 02a the FBO, one set up of public hangers, and Tuskegee Airman hanger is missing, not sure how because that is certainly big enough to show up on maps. The closer to real life they can make this that much more immersive it's going to be for those who have flown over areas.

- Would like the weight shift trike added to the planes

All in all very pleased, specific to VR very impressed! The fact it can make me forget I'm at a computer at times and not in the actual plane is something no flight sim as done before. I highly recommend this and can tell you from a visual perspective it's highly realistic and in VR that much more immersive.

But as someone who tried playing it on and off since it launched on the Bethesda net platform and have put around 300h now so i can safely say that the game isn't that bad but my god is it tedious to play. Which is a shame because there's a LOT to love in 76 : It has the best map of the franchise, an amazing art direction, ton of loot and quest and everything but its all for nothing because once you get past level 30 unless you grind and pay that 1st sub, the game will constantly fight you.
Want to play it like its Fo4 and just have fun exploring the wasteland and doing quests? Well once you hit level 30 most enemies turn into bullet sponges, your crafting become much, much more costly on ressources and at some point the main quest will straight up force you to grind events to progress. Basically once you hit level 30 and until at least level 50 when the level scalling stabilise the game go from a fun adventure in the Appalachian Wastelands to pure tedium and once you hit level 50 it show its true colors and turn into another MMO grind job with dailies and challenges and a pseudo battle pass and trust me there's much better MMO's than 76 out there.",lot fo76 criticism made people either never played game played like 2h year ago someone tried playing since launched bethesda net platform put around 300h safely say game bad god tedious play shame lot love 76 best map franchise amazing art direction ton loot quest everything nothing get past level 30 unless grind pay 1st sub game constantly fight want play like fo4 fun exploring wasteland quest well hit level 30 enemy turn bullet sponge crafting become much much costly ressources point main quest straight force grind event progress basically hit level 30 least level 50 level scalling stabilise game go fun adventure appalachian wasteland pure tedium hit level 50 show true color turn another mmo grind job daily challenge pseudo battle pas trust much better mmo 76
582660,Black Desert,"Pros:

- The world is beautiful. Enemies are different from your regular MMO.
- The combat system is extremely complexed. You ""can"" hotbar buttons, however you're handicapping yourself if you don't press them in real actions like Up+F. It's much more fluid if you press action combinations for combos. What makes this the combat different than the others is move canceling. I didn't know this was in this game until I saw another player performing impossible moves.
- The grind actually feels good because you're performing attacks that are beyond that of rinse and repeat. You even feel like an absolute god.
- lots of jobs: crafting, fishing, tanning, etc. You can get lost in them for hours, and there's also a ranking system on it, which is weird but good if you like that kick back experience.


neutral:

- Gender lock, however some classes are just like the other such as Wizard and Witch or Musa and Maehwa.
- confusing minigames and small tutorial in the beginning that won't teach you anymore after the first 10 lvls.
- No fast travel, just your feet or your mount. The mount is an actual being too. Enemies can attack it seperately and kill it.

Cons:

- No endgame anything. Gears is by daily/weekly miniboss challenges in a particular location, which will take you 5-10 minutes on mount.
- No dungeon runs either. Match making isn't in this game. You want to party with people, you do it the old fashion way: by guild or shouting.
- RNG everything. However, this can be fixed with +luck gear. Luck will help increase particular chances but RNG rules most of everything whether farming, damage from particular anything, drops and stats on gear doing particular things.
- A turn-off to newcomers that don't like hard MMOs. The learning curve for this game is pretty high, but if you like a challenge it's rewarding. Those that like just pressing hotbar commands are the first to suffer after reaching lvl 50.
-A Majority of quests (if not life skills) are fetch and kill. Talk to NPC, go kill 30+ enemies, come back. This is what you call a Korean Grinder MMO.

Pay extra portion:

There are key things that make microtransactions somewhat enticing: Pets, value packs, extra inventory and weight limit expansion. Although you can play this game ""pay once"" like it was intended to be played, however these items make the game much easier PvE. As for PvP, there's nothing that can one up another player PvP other than better gear. Better gear is bought with silver and silver is power. In order to get this sort of silver, there are many ways, and what makes getting silver extremely easier are these items I've listed for microtransactions.

1) Pets w/a max of 4 can pick up items for you and carry on their own. This alleviates some of the stress of picking up items from mobs. Each pet is roughly $8 real money, but if you play the game long enough, 20 days gets you a free penguin (at least for the time being). At lower levels, pets aren't something you'll consider, however in higher levels while you're in a party you'll have that one player with pets, and that player will take everything that's dropped.

2) value packs: you can buy a 30 day value pack for $15, which is basically their version of subscription fee. This can be bought in auction houses with ingame currency, however it's quite hard to get one as it's the highest sought out item in the market and they only release 1-2 every 10-15 minutes. The value pack increase 100 weight limite, 16 inventory slots and 16 storage, and on top of that you get %30 back for auction house sales. What does that mean for sales? W/o it you're typically selling everything for roughtly 60%. That 300k stone sold will only give you back 180k unless you have the value pack in which you'll get back 210k. This actually adds up as you will be selling millions of items in the auction house and a majority of your income is by this.

3) inventory space. In-game there are quests that can increase your inventory space up to 30, or you can pay a premium and increase it even further to around 90, which a lot of life skillers do. If you want to carry a ton of different items, it's almost needed for you to carry so many things at once.

4) weight limit increase. You can grind to increase the strength of your character to carry heavier items, or you can have particular items that already increase your weight limit like the value pack or hercules gear that increase you 150+ weight. However, in higher levels there is gear that is far superior that you'll want to equip, so increasing your strength to carry is something that is either grinded or bought with microtransactions.

There are other items that I didn't list, but that's because they're a want vs need. These 4 that I've listed a borderline ""need"". All-in-all you can potentially play this game completely ""pay-once"" as it is intended whether being $6-10, but you will be extremely tempted to purchase one of the 4 items in order to make your life a bit easier in-game. One of the things you'll probably consider is the value pack as it is basically a subscription fee for WoW or FFXIV. Don't let that mentality of trading one MMO for another for its subscription fee sway your wallet. You should only buy this pack if you really do want to invest your time and real money into this game as BDO is multiple games in one. BDO with the core of a MMORPG has many elements that make it multiple games. These other games are called life skils.

1) Fishing: sure, you can fish in any mmo, but can you build a ship go to another island or in the middle of nowhere and fish there? With whatever you've caught you have options of cooking or finding a trader to buy your fish, which becomes an actual job that many players have come to enjoy called AFK fishing.

2) trade empire: I'm new to this concept but you can potentially connect areas through trade routes, process or build trade crates and have them shipped to another area to sell for a profit. You can have works around the world collect and bring back to your storage items in order to process or built crates to trade again making it a trade empire in which you can also haggle prices for these items in a different area.

3) Cooking/alchemy: the most effecient way to cook/alchemy and make money is by having contract NPC workers find resources, bring it back to your storage units in each town where you can make the necessary food or potions and then sell them on the market.

Again, the 4 microtransactions are borderline needs and they're more purpose for those that are serious about this game and for specific situations. Grinders: pets; traders/fishers: inventory space and weight limit; and alchemy/cooking: value pack. Although you can give your character all of them to make your character more well rounded, they're not much of a need as comparison to these particular key points. I hope this helps, and if you want to know more, leave a comment.

TL;DR

Is this game worth your time? Yes, because other mmos are really old and out of date. Top subscription IMO is FFXIV vs WoW. Top free to play mmo is Star Wars, however it's only up to lvl 50 free. Best pay once: this game followed by Guild wars 2 and then ESO.

What about p2w? It's significant. Since you're paying once, and if you played any mmo, you most likely put money into the game that was more than just subsciption or just the base of the game. If there's a game you really care about, you'd support it by buying something whether cosmetic or actually helpful. For the price they're asking for is pretty cheap. You have a choice whether or not to put more into it. If you get sucked into this game like I have, believe me, this is one game you won't regret. This game sets a standards of graphics and combat that newer mmos should have. I'd hate to have the next best mmo come with runescape graphics or Maple story 2-D feel.",pro world beautiful enemy different regular mmo combat system extremely complexed hotbar button however handicapping press real action like f much fluid press action combination combo make combat different others move canceling know game saw another player performing impossible move grind actually feel good performing attack beyond rinse repeat even feel like absolute god lot job crafting fishing tanning etc get lost hour also ranking system weird good like kick back experience neutral gender lock however class like wizard witch musa maehwa confusing minigames small tutorial beginning teach anymore first 10 lvls fast travel foot mount mount actual enemy attack seperately kill con endgame anything gear daily weekly miniboss challenge particular location take 5 10 minute mount dungeon run either match making game want party people old fashion way guild shouting rng everything however fixed luck gear luck help increase particular chance rng rule everything whether farming damage particular anything drop stats gear particular thing turn newcomer like hard mmos learning curve game pretty high like challenge rewarding like pressing hotbar command first suffer reaching lvl 50 majority quest life skill fetch kill talk npc go kill 30 enemy come back call korean grinder mmo pay extra portion key thing make microtransactions somewhat enticing pet value pack extra inventory weight limit expansion although play game pay like intended played however item make game much easier pve pvp nothing one another player pvp better gear better gear bought silver silver power order get sort silver many way make getting silver extremely easier item listed microtransactions 1 pet w max 4 pick item carry alleviates stress picking item mob pet roughly 8 real money play game long enough 20 day get free penguin least time lower level pet something consider however higher level party one player pet player take everything dropped 2 value pack buy 30 day value pack 15 basically version subscription fee bought auction house ingame currency however quite hard get one highest sought item market release 1 2 every 10 15 minute value pack increase 100 weight limite 16 inventory slot 16 storage top get 30 back auction house sale mean sale w typically selling everything roughtly 60 300k stone sold give back 180k unless value pack get back 210k actually add selling million item auction house majority income 3 inventory space game quest increase inventory space 30 pay premium increase even around 90 lot life skillers want carry ton different item almost needed carry many thing 4 weight limit increase grind increase strength character carry heavier item particular item already increase weight limit like value pack hercules gear increase 150 weight however higher level gear far superior want equip increasing strength carry something either grinded bought microtransactions item list want v need 4 listed borderline need potentially play game completely pay intended whether 6 10 extremely tempted purchase one 4 item order make life bit easier game one thing probably consider value pack basically subscription fee wow ffxiv let mentality trading one mmo another subscription fee sway wallet buy pack really want invest time real money game bdo multiple game one bdo core mmorpg many element make multiple game game called life skils 1 fishing sure fish mmo build ship go another island middle nowhere fish whatever caught option cooking finding trader buy fish becomes actual job many player come enjoy called afk fishing 2 trade empire new concept potentially connect area trade route process build trade crate shipped another area sell profit work around world collect bring back storage item order process built crate trade making trade empire also haggle price item different area 3 cooking alchemy effecient way cook alchemy make money contract npc worker find resource bring back storage unit town make necessary food potion sell market 4 microtransactions borderline need purpose serious game specific situation grinder pet trader fisher inventory space weight limit alchemy cooking value pack although give character make character well rounded much need comparison particular key point hope help want know leave comment tl dr game worth time yes mmos really old date top subscription imo ffxiv v wow top free play mmo star war however lvl 50 free best pay game followed guild war 2 eso p2w significant since paying played mmo likely put money game subsciption base game game really care support buying something whether cosmetic actually helpful price asking pretty cheap choice whether put get sucked game like believe one game regret game set standard graphic combat newer mmos hate next best mmo come runescape graphic maple story 2 feel
552990,World of Warships,"I have put 2200+ hours into this game. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't. At its core, this game is fantastic. The mechanics, ship handling, etc. It's a lot of fun. Learning the ins and outs of ships, how they work, how to play to their strengths and exploit other ships' weaknesses. However, in recent months this game has turned into a downward spiral. The games slowly became less fun and more frustrating, and no, I'm not talking about bad teammates; you'll see those in any game.

I did not whale or spend much money; I was more of a dolphin looking at my spending over 3-4 years. If you are a new player looking in, I implore you to reconsider. The devs only care about one thing, and that's your wallet. They don't care about player opinion, hell they outright deleted the forums, which for one, still deleted dissenting player opinion but was a place with a tight-knit community. They have had a track record of not supporting their content creators, as some were highly critical about where the game was going. They were kicked from their program. Wargaming hates player opinion. It's either their way or the highway, which makes the decision to quit and uninstall easier. This was easily seen with the implementation of subs, players begged WG not to add them, but unfortunately, they were added, and everyone hates them. 

Microtransactions in this game are deplorable. High Tier Premium ships can and will set you back a ton ($50-$100). More than half of them aren't good; many ships aren't that great. WG also takes forever to balance things; if your ship is old, forget it. It's been power crept to hell, most likely, or isn't even playable since its accuracy is downright awful. There were many times that I loved a ship only to realize that in many situations, no matter how good you were, it was just bad, and playing it was frustrating since everything around you was better. I loved the Italian BB ship gimmick and line after playing the CA line. But let me tell you, that line is garbage until you get to the tiers 9 and 10, unlike the CA line. The accuracy on those things hasn't changed since the deadeye removal, and good luck killing a DD! They capped the damage on the shells. I had a moment where I was in the Colombo, and a DD tanked 12 SAP SHELLS!!! WHAT?!? Meanwhile, the CA Italian line shreds them like butter. It may seem I'm ranting, which is partially true, but it's frustrating when game devs don't listen to the player base and constantly lie to them. They even go out of their way to be stingy with rewards (Super containers were nerfed and give nothing now). Even the grind to tier 10 is painful, and I've played Warframe. I Have more fun grinding in that game than in this one. I want to get into many other issues, but this is already a long review, so I'll keep it brief.

Save your money and time. Don't download this game; play something better. The devs don't care about what you think as a player base and only care about how much they can siphon out of you. The game has become frustrating to play with the introduction of subs, and seeing how it's going, it will only get worse from here if the devs don't change their ways. I don't even recommend this game to my friends even though it's my most played game.

899770,Last Epoch,"This game is just like Wolcen, in no way whatsoever. 

This review is specifically about my experience in the game and with the community throughout the Alpha and Beta. With over 500hrs I feel like I am in a unique spot to hightlight the good and the bad. 

First, the price... Even at the current price of $30 or so the game is an absolute steal. For those who choose to wait and not pay a premium for beta access, the game will be $15 at release. The developers have confirmed that the real money shop will be purely cosmetic. 

This game has two major things going for it, the extremely customizable gameplay and very active and transparent Dev team. The development team has been very prompt when it comes to new content. From what I have seen a new patch is out about once a month, and every other patch has major improvements/additions to the gameplay. Devs are not ashamed to push back an update or a feature in order to ensure quality. Don't get me wrong, there are still bugs in the game but they are addressed quickly and usually fixed by the next patch. Overall, probably the best dev team of any game that I have followed closely. 

Now to my second point, customization. As I mentioned, even at the current price you will have no problem getting your moneys worth. There are 5 classes(still missing one, Rouge) and each class has 3 very distinct passive trees. Each different passive tree of every class has 1, if not multiple different possible builds that can be explored(most can be competitive). Now to the truly ""juicy"" part, every single active skill have their own skill tree(excluding some skills  who's skill trees are not released yet) This means that not only do you have a ton of choices when it comes to passives, but you also have the ability to change how fundamentally some of your active skills work. At 500hrs, I still haven't explored all possible builds. Not to mention that there is a ton of content yet to come out which would only add to the game. 

The main question I have seen from people contemplating buying the game is, ""Is it worth the money?"". If you like RPGs you will like this game. You just need to understand that as of right now(Jun 2020) this game is still early access and may not be as polished as other major games of the genre such as PoE, D3, and Grim Dawn which have had years to improve. One thing I have never had to worry about with this game is the solid development and the steady improvements of gameplay and bugs. 

I hope this helps and If you choose to get the game, enjoy!

There are alot of people dogging on this game for just being another repeat - which it is. I have to agree with this. But also remember the fact there's a ton of new features and polishing with this. This game feels like a whole different franchise just from the polishing. There isn't random clipping textures, holes in equipment, 144p looking wear textures on equipment.. This game looks good. Like really good. Though if I'm honest this game is what 19 needed to be.

Big features with this version are the addition of built in seasons which you can customize to your liking, and while it may not be Realismus seasons, it's pretty damn good. I really enjoy playing with it. Also the maps have tons of live features now, so for example when a new DLC is approaching the billboards and signs start showing info for that DLC, and during seasons, you'll see barbecues in the summer, halloween deco in October, and snowmen/Christmas deco in December. It's a really nice addition, and finally the maps feel like they have some life. As for the maps themselves, you have Elmcreek which is based in the Midwest region of the USA, hard to place exactly where but I would say Iowa/Indiana/Illinois area, just based on the overall area. There is also a french map, that I think is pretty bland and disappointing, and I couldn't say where it's based but I would say it's the western part. There is also Erlengrat which is a Swiss map from FS19's Alpine DLC. It's the exact same map and while I love playing on it, it does have some FPS issues and can be very confusing if you don't understand the concept of the map.

Next we move onto equipment. Here's where it gets wild. The brands they brought into this release, among small things everybody has wanted, is insane. There has to be a minimum of 25 new brands in this game and at least 100 new machines not counting any DLC. It's truly insane the equipment selection in this game. There's some weak points, like mid size seeders and cultivators, but there's ways around it. You of course have plenty of mods, or you can stick with smaller stuff and just deal with the extra time taken. I do a mix of both. There's some tractors that have US and EU spec options, all crawler tractors and harvesters have 3D tracks, interiors are fully animated.. There's an insane jump in this version that 19 doesn't have. Yes 19 had some stupid nice tractors but not all. You could see the recycled stuff compared to the new stuff, in this version even the recycled equipment has all the up to date features. It's truly another level of attention to detail. Not to mention loaders and such now make a bang when lowered fully, new hydraulic sounds, new attach sounds.. And don't forget manual transmissions. While the implementation of manuals is pretty garbage, it's still one more thing this game was severely lacking in older versions. It's only weird on some vehicles, on some it works fine. All in all having this feature in the base game is a huge jump even if it's implemented terribly.

In terms of the farming aspect, it's pretty much the same, however there are some small differences. With Seasons enabled, you can only plant and harvest in certain months of the year, which adds just a little more realism. Crop growth is no longer randomized. It takes a set amount of months to grow whether you have Seasons on or off. For example wheat takes 10 months, and potatoes take 5. The plant/harvest chart reflects this. Turning off the seasons just makes it where you plant whenever and harvest whenever. There is also parallox occlusion mapping, which makes anything rows look 3D even though they aren't. While it may not be as good as true 3D ground, it looks extremely nice. There are also grape vines and olive groves now, and the respective equipment to harvest these. They are annoying, but fun. There are no new animals in this version. Aside from these it's pretty much the same old farming system from 19.

Now on to landscaping and build mode. The landscaping mode remains mostly unchanged from FS19 aside from being way more polished and working a whole lot better, among new ground materials. Foliage and ground are separated, and you can do some truly wild stuff through the landscaping tool. As for build mode, this is a new addition that effectively took the Placeables menu and turned it into it's own mode. There's a ton of new lists and menus, you can place almost anything. Fences, animal pens, decorations, productions.. Almost anything you can place, and if you don't find it there, guaranteed there's a mod for it. You can literally build a map from bare nothing if you want using just the build and terrain tools. It's pretty cool.

Coming to the end you have stuff such as the modhub, crossplay support, multiplayer, and other finishing touches. The multiplayer is an absolute disaster. I'm not talking in people, I'm talking the server side. It's been pretty broken since the game's release, and only minimal improvements over time. They consolidated the 6 individual servers down to 1 massive server, and on busy days, forget MP entirely. It overloads in no time flat, and if you do get in, have fun staying in. It's a DISASTER. As for the in game modhub, not much is changed, though you no longer have to restart after getting mods, they just automatically install and you're all set. There's a good selection of mods, both PC only and crossplay, and that brings us to crossplay. You can play with someone on a console, from PC, as long as you have matching CROSSPLAY mods. Not just any mod is crossplay, only certain ones are. Because consoles are so limited on space and licensing, only non licensed (and brands already in-game) are allowed. This will never be changed. If you want a bunch of cool modded stuff, buy a PC and do the game the right way. Consoles are NOT meant for this type of game.

All in all, this game is a 7/10. There are a ton of good features about it, it's extremely stable and seems to just work all times unlike the last 2 versions, and there are a few bad features. The biggest thing to me is I feel like a lot of the features of this should have been for FS19 and in this version they should've focused on 3D ground, more realistic harvesting, more crops and other things people have been asking about for years. But maybe the next iteration will have a few of these. Though this is a healthy addition, and while 19 was a ton of fun and I enjoyed it, this is a MUCH more polished game. 19 was constantly crashing, full of broken equipment, missing textures, bugged maps and more. This one has hardly any bugs. Even when it released almost everything worked, and within 2 weeks the game had no bugs. The only real issue is the multiplayer, but it works if you understand when to use it for a good experience. All in all this game is a very polished and fun to play game. The price tag is a little high, but it is worth it. The attention to detail in this version is worth the extra money. You won't notice it until you play but they went over the top with details on everything. It's pretty awesome.

Hope this was a helpful review that talks someone into this game. I know I've gotten my moneys worth and will continue to do so. This is a really good game in the series.

1931770,Chants of Sennaar,"[h1]“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” -  Ludwig Wittgenstein[/h1]

[h2]Preface[/h2]

[i]Chants Of Sennaar[/i] is a language-based puzzle game loosely based on the biblical myth of the Tower of Babel, with the game’s narrative taking place in a structure similar to Etemenanki.
Throughout the game, you will have the chance to travel through five levels of the tower, each inhibited by a different nation with an entirely distinct linguistic system and culture.
Using only non-verbal information presented to you in the beginning, your task is to translate and understand each one, and in the end, break the long-lasting language barriers by connecting each nation together.

This title is one of the brightest releases of the year, offering plenty of challenges even to the most skilled puzzle player while also presenting a deep and philosophical narrative paired with phenomenal art and music direction.


[b]Pros[/b]
+ Phenomenal puzzle design with an adequately good learning curve
+ A minimalist graphical style, paired with beautiful musical score
+ A surprisingly engaging narrative with a multitude of philosophical questions

[b]Cons[/b]
- The stealth sections felt somewhat unnecessary

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

You'll encounter your first puzzle just a few minutes into the game, and it's so easy it shouldn't even be called a puzzle. 
In your path is a door with a lever on the right side. To unlock the door, simply turn the lever. If not, it will have to close. 
The up and down positions of the lever, however, both have labels, so it's not hard to figure out which one represents ""open"" and which one represents ""close.""

This basic premise is exploited extensively in a wide variety of ways throughout [i]Chants Of Sennaar[/i]. Naturally, most puzzles will be significantly more challenging than this, but the fundamental mechanics will remain constant.
What I find most intriguing about this title is how much of it depends on the player's—that is, the person in front of the screen's—knowledge.
The game provides a way to check if your translation is correct, but it is not necessary to use it to complete the game. This one feature alone made the game much more enjoyable for me; I've never previously felt so accomplished and satisfied when playing a puzzle game. 

Both the variety and the difficulty of the puzzles vary greatly throughout the levels - some will require a little bit of backtracking, others will incorporate the language from a previous level, and in some instances, you will face a stealth scenario, which for me felt completely unnecessary and threw me a little off-guard. Don’t get me wrong - it isn’ t hard at all, but it doesn’t fit well into the game.
Each level connects to at least two others, allowing you to easily backtrack whenever you like. If you're a completist, you'll have to put in some time wandering around to unlock all the achievements, but doing so is simple and won't cause you any trouble.

Naturally, up until this point, my main focus was on describing the puzzle mechanics that are the heart of the game - however, it is worth noting that the game has a narrative that isn’t afraid to delve into some philosophical topics. Learning about the history of the world and the structure that surrounds you is part of the fun, so I don’t want to take away from your enjoyment.
However, it is safe to say that the game’s message (which is something that’s been said numerous times) is best summarized by [i]Rita Mae Brown[/i]: ""Language is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.""

On a final note, I feel like both the art and the music direction deserve praising: making each level unique isn’t only about constructing different languages but also about showcasing each nation’s distinct culture. The game generally uses stylized graphics with very vibrant hues; however, each level uses fundamentally different colors, which represent its inhabitants. The music is also very effective in creating an immersive experience, achieved by using different variations of a general melody throughout the game.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]

As much as I want to stay analytical and explore both the positive and negative sides of this game, I simply can’t find any hiccups or elements that heavily impacted my enjoyment - it is safe to say that [i]Chants Of Sennaar[/i] is a strong contender for the indie game of the year award, nonetheless the puzzle game of the year award!

The early and mid game was quite enjoyable, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten to the insufferable endgame. To keep up to date with the latest content, you have to do dailies on a wide roster of characters. These consume so much of your time, become soul draining and repetitive after enough times. All of that work to hone for a CHANCE of getting your item level to qualify for the newest content. Then there’s gatekeeping where it’s essentially a job interview. Your hard work of grinding dailies every single day to qualify for the raids aren’t enough, because now you have the meet the expectations of other players who expect you to have the perfect gear, have the boss memorized to the core, and make zero mistakes. So you have to do even MORE grinding in order to get the right equipment and engravings, somehow become experienced in the raid but no one will accept you because you’re not experienced, and become a robot that perfectly executes every single mechanic. This game and its community is ruthless to casual and new players, as only the hardcore players are welcomed. The only play style in lost ark is hardcore, playing casually is literally impossible. I already have enough work to do in my life, I don’t need any more. If you want to play a game that is fun, can be casual, and respects your time, don’t play lost ark.

[b]Game Pros[/b]
• Giant fully explorable beautifully designed world
• Night/Day Cycle (3 hours each)
• Weather
• 1st and 3rd person is easily accessible
• Designated PvP area
• Customer support is very helpful
• Various lines and skills for crafting 
• Ton of possible character builds
• Mass amount of quests. (You'll have a hard time running out of things to do)
• Frequent updates
• A lot dungeons ranging in difficulty for you and your friends (or random players) to complete.
• Microtransactions are mainly all cosmetics (Other than mounts and crafting styles) 

[b]Game Cons[/b]
• If you have poor internet, prepare for the longest download. (80Gb)
• You can only group up with players from the same faction. So if your friends join a different one, you're out of luck
• Minor bugs (Rooms can take a little to fully load, possible freezing/crashing)
• Pricing of mounts is a little high (It takes awhile for the normal player to earn even 10,000 Gold. While most horses are 42,000 gold. Other than that, there is one that is 10,000 Gold. Only other option is buying it through the micro-transaction store)
• Only guild stores and AI markets. There is no public tradepost (like you would find in Guild Wars)

[b]Controversial Features[/b]
• Leveling system can be EXTREMLY slow, and may take a lot of time and effort to level up

[b]Relateable Games[/b]
• Guild Wars 
• WoW 
• Skyrim 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Elder Scrolls Online is a very fun and potentially an addicting Massive multiplayer online game. 900+ quests, giant open world map with a ton of caves, and dungeons, to explore. Sure there is some cons here and there, but overall I would reccomend this game to any person who enjoys MMOs. In the first 2-3 days of having it, I hit 30+ hours of gameplay. If you got the money and time, i'd pick this one up for sure. And no, you can not do shouts, and there is no dragons. This isn't skyrim.

578080,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,"I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.
Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.

I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.

That was until the official release of 1.0
Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?

LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.

You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.
They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:
 
In game purchases.

It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.
They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.
Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.

Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:

Pros:
- Fast queue times due to high player-base,
- SOLID graphics.
- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)


Cons:
- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.

EDIT:
- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.

- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)

- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)

- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.

- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)

- Retarded level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.

- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.

- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.

Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.

This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it.

1190970,House Flipper 2,"House Flipper 2 is quickly becoming one of my favorite fantasy RPGs. In this series, you play a young ""home owner"" which is kind of like a mage or wizard except your special power is that you can afford to [b]buy[/b] a house(A house is kind of like an apartment but you have space between you and your neighbors, think like a whole building devoted to just your apartment.). Once you buy the house, your quests are to make it livable and clean. Often times this involves things such as picking up trash, painting, and placing furniture. If you succeed, you can then sell the house and buy another house, increasing your powers through the ritual of ""Selling"" or ""Flipping"", which let you perform cleaning or painting faster. When you perform a Selling, you sell your House to a new Home Owner and buy a new, bigger home to better show your prowess. The furniture placement, styling, alignment, and controls feel like a huge improvement over the previous iteration.

The game has a few rough edges. Performance needs polish, but I found that disabling dynamic resolution(set it to None) helped immensely and let me keep it at a steady 60 FPS on High Settings with a 1080Ti. Some of the tool-specific controls could use some tweaking - trash bag tossing follows its own novel physics unseen until now, and the window cleaning can get jittery with high DPI mouses, but those more like occasional annoyances rather than show-stoppers. 

Overall I would recommend it, it's a fantastic ""chilling and listening to an audiobook"" style game and can be picked up and set down very quickly, making it great for when you just want to play for 10-20 minutes before going to clean your own kitchen, which you've ignored to clean a virtual kitchen.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","Darktide is an absolutely fantastic horde combat game brought low by terrible design of it's progression and secondary systems. I'll be comparing to Vermintide 2 heavily here, because Fatshark seems to have learned basically nothing from their last release.

Combat: 
Combat is for the most part excellent, fans of Vermintide will be well at home. Notable is that combat feels much better than Vermintide and ranged combat is blended much more cleanly with melee combat. Overall I have few complaints, in fact I wish I could judge the game on combat alone, because if I could this review would be positive. There are a few issues, notable that class balance is very uneven; the Veteran excels at basically everything in the game(although notably, the Veteran was unplayable for three days after launch because of a game breaking bug), the Ogryn excels at horde control and close range combat, where the Psyker falls behind greatly at higher difficulties and the Zealot feels unfinished. Still, all the classes are enjoyable to play up to difficulty 3 out of 5 difficulties. 

The Music:
Five stars.

The visuals:
Five stars, but the game runs like shit for most people.

Level Variety: 
The first truly noticeable problem in Darktide is that, unlike Vermintide 2, nearly every level in Darktide looks the same. In fact, you may notice in doing a different level, it seems like you're going through parts of another level backwards. Yeah, it's because you are. There is heavy assest reuse in the fairly limited number of maps, with only two areas that I can meaningfully differentiate visually. There is a Throneside map that takes place in a noble area and a Desert map that takes place in, well, a desert. Everything else is the same mishmash of reused industrial hallways. There's set pieces here and there, and I can't really complain about authenticity, because the levels FEEL very 40k. But in VT2 I could immediately tell what level I was in almost all of the time. In Darktide entire rooms are reused completely. 

Stability:
Game crashes, a lot. More than the beta.

Progression: 
Folks familiar with these games will know that you don't just clear levels once, you clear levels to get gear which you use to tackle harder difficulties. This has been horribly botched. In Vermintide 2, you got a chest after every mission with three items in it, the quality of which were based on the difficulty you tackled, the amount of challenge items you brought back(scriptures and grimoires), the amount you explored(loot dice), and the amount of monstrosities you slew(loot dice), and some RNG. Good players could consistently get the highest end crates by tackling higher difficulties and coming back with 3 scriptures and 2 gimoires, a ""full books"" run. You were also awarded a chest whenever you gained enough experience for another level, even if you were at the level cap. If you didn't like the items, you could break them down into materials to craft items you did want to use; so if I kept getting blue swords, but I wanted a hammer, I could break down a couple blue swords and get enough materials to make a hammer of my level and upgrade it to a blue. Pretty clean, pretty satisfying, and doing missions was always rewarding since at the very least you were getting materials to upgrade your stuff or reroll perks. 

All of this is gone in Darktide. Monstrosities(boss monsters) do not drop loot dice, scriptures and grimoires grant a pathetic amount of XP for returning them(and grimoires are HARDER) when they even spawn in a level, and you only, very rarely, get a single item at the end of a mission whose quality seems completely detached from both the difficulty and the teams performance. So how does one get gear? The geniuses at fatshark have common up with an incredible idea: there's a gear shop with a completely random set of ~10 gear pieces that you can buy that resets hourly, conveniently located next to the real money cash shop, which you have to run past to check the gear store from the hub location. So yes, you will have to run past the cash shop after every other mission to check that maybe the gear shop has something you actually want. The best way to get gear you want is to leave the game open in the background(good luck, it's a resource hog) and check the shop every hour. 

Crafting new items of a type you might actually want is not in the game nor is it planned to be, and the community manager has called such a feature lore unfriendly; something which is absolutely not true if you are at all familiar with 40k lore. One of four planned crafting features exists in the full release of this game, which is the ability to upgrade gear a rarity tier in exchange for crafting materials found in missions. These upgraded items have random perks and blessings. Oh, and you have to run past the real money cash shop on the way from the gear store to the crafting shop. 

There is one other store for items, which sells stuff in exchange for a weekly currency you get from doing special contracts. These are fairly easy but this shop only resets daily with four higher quality items, but I've yet to see a weapon worth buying in it. The contracts deliver most of their value from completing a full weekly set of them, which is especially frustrating as the contracts often completely bug out and do not progress at all even when you fulfill their requirements. 

The Hub: 
It's bad. You know how the castle in VT2 loaded quickly and you could switch characters instantly? That takes two loading screens now, I assume because the hub is fully online. And I can't think of a single reason to make the hub a worse experience other than so that you'll look at other players cosmetics. VT2 had just your party in the hub and ran much better. There is a test room with every type of enemy in it now though, so I'll give them credit for that improvement. 

Microtranscations & Cosmetics:
I will note that Fatshark, as of 2021, is a subsidiary company of Tencent. If you aren't familiar with Tencent, they are a Chinese company infamous for pumping games full of microtranscations. I have no idea how much influence they have over Darktide's microtranscation model, but there's some predatory design in this game. 

As I've mentioned above, the cash shop is positioned so that you have to run past it constantly, and the hub is designed to get you to view other players cosmetics. There are some free cosmetics in the game, but these are either earned by ridiculously stupid challenges, like kill a monstrosity by doing 90% of the damage to it with a single class ability, or ending a mission with zero ammo and 100% accuracy on a class that regenerates ammo when it kills a special, or taking no melee damage for an entire run, or doing an entire run without ever being more than 10m from ANY of your allies. There are also some cosmetics you can buy with in game currency, but they are all recolors. The paid cosmetics are generally better looking, and Fatshark has implemented full FOMO by putting up 2 cosmetic sets each week for each class with no information on what will be coming next rotation or when the cosmetics currently in the shop will be available again. 

Fatshark & Broken Promises: 
Fatshark is a developer who, even prior to being acquired, had no idea what a timetable was, and often broke their game for months by introducing poorly planned features before going radio silent. This is on full display with this release. The full release of the game is missing advertised weapons, advertised cosmetics, and advertised progression features. I am fairly confident based on the lifecycle of VT2 that these things will be added; eventually. When Fatshark gets around to it. And when that happens this game will probably be worth your time and money. Until then? I'd give it a pass unless you really really love both 40k and VT2, and are willing to play a game that is much worse than VT2 just for the 40k aesthetic.",darktide absolutely fantastic horde combat

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.

1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.

2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 

3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 

4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 

5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. 

That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos.

230410,Warframe,"This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.",story requires bit setup last year friend mine known gaming long time contacted told great new game beta backing founder called grandmaster game called warframe third person cooperative shooter element phantasy star online diablo loot run procedurally generated level content added time game difficult start many key various secret parkour maneuver running along wall sliding ziplines soon completely hooked friend playing late night trying grind one piece necessary build new component weapon trying beat best time survival mission fend ever growing wave foe life support tick year many great victory hair raising last second escape new friend joining little group many hour spent joking around skype cracking joke blasting weird song coming stupid little catchphrase flash forward year warframe space combat new warframes new weapon new combat control game still original style much improved last week four player regular team developed incredible strategy let u get ever wave defense mission thing made u stop getting tired tuesday friend invited game year ago show night found wednesday passed away suddenly undiagnosed health condition shock still hitting u hard friendship formed game gone instant hardly feel real keep expecting log ready another defense mission difficult accept going alone contacted digital extreme company make game asked anything could dedicated 11 20 2014 episode webcast memory friend read memorial air reaction heartfelt touching really listen react community recommend game much fun recommend play group friend voice chat four per session gameplay experience may vary alone form clan join one many item clan recommend responsive game developer community constantly improve add new content item weapon storyline unfolding voice acting delightful could easily play game without spending single dollar real world currency real world currency used cosmetic increasing number warframes weapon buying thing wait thanks digital extreme rest peace woxit

Playful, whimsical, charming. Paired with the fantastic water effects and the day/night cycle, the world feels uplifting from minute 1. You can practically smell the crisp, salty air... 


[h1]The learning curve:[/h1]
Reasonable. You can master the basics within the first hour, and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life.


[h1]The play style:[/h1] 
Interestingly enough, you don't level up your weapons, skills, or ship's abilities. The changes are purely cosmetic... and I love it. While I've enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves, this style feels much more comfortable. YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item (a cool ship's livery, a flashy new hat), but you aren't penalized for being a newcomer. Yes, the fancy canons look nice, but they are just as powerful as the default canons. 

You build your reputation with different factions (aka Companies), which leads to unlocking better paying gigs (aka Voyages) and cool-looking items. This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew: A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better-paying Voyage, and then everyone in their crew can participate. I love this-- if you happen to outrank your friends/crewmates, you can offer to buy that Voyage. Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page (ie, Tall Tales), but that's ok. Means you can have a positive experience doing one-off Voyages some times, and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs. 


[h1]My experience so far:[/h1]
I played the beta, but only recently bought the game. Even though I missed a massive gap of updates, I don't feel left behind. I love going on adventures with my friends, or winding down the evening with some solo-slooping. I live in a different timezone than my crew, which has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre-adventure prepwork (gathering supplies for the ship, fishing and cooking said fish so we'll have extra stamina). It's fun, and is surprisingly soothing. 

PVP has been interesting. When I solo, I try to avoid conflict. When I'm with my crew, we meet it head-on! Both dynamics are enjoyable: Being stealthy, hiding behind mountains, darting around the map, versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly...! So good. 


[h1]Why I especially like this game (and why you might like it too):[/h1]
I'm a fan of all things nautical, and I come from a WoW background. For me, this feels like the best parts of WoW: You can tackle massive monsters with your friends, you can choose to grind for random achievements, and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration. Plus, the outfits/livery options...! Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic, you can mix and match to your heart's content. 

[h1]I imagine you would NOT like this game if:[/h1]
-- You only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games.
-- You hate everything to do with water.

[h1]I imagine you would like this game if:[/h1]
-- You have always wanted to be a pirate.
-- You have at least one person to adventure with some of the time.
-- You like to blow things up.
-- You like to sneak away from danger.
-- When playing other games, you find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectives, but have a better time for it.

HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:  HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:  HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:


On release of the new Iceborne DLC they also  released new items and gear for the base game.  One specific set of these  items are called defender items. Right off the bat Capcom gives you top tier weapons. Why? Because they want you to breeze through the early stages of the game and buy the DLC. Im not saying this was a terrible idea. In fact it was a good move for people that wanted to skip early instances of grind. The problem was how they presented it. New players coming into the game  would see that these items had better stats than anything else that they could get their hands on. There was no warning or caution. Even after beating bosses until  late game anything that is craftworthy is still outdone by these defender items. As of  right now im replaying  the game on a new character without the gear and it's  more fun because i actually have to learn attack patterns instead of facetanking and using the same move over and over. (it actually works like that with guardian gear). 

This is a very minor issue which is why im giving this a good review because it's still a bloody fucking good game. And the expansion is massive so use  them to your liking. However you're paying money for the base game too and it shouldn't be spoiled just because you didn't know any better.

289070,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,"tl;dr: Just play Civ V instead.

Well, I've been trying to love this game for 642 hours now (as opposed to 3532 hours wasted/enjoyed in Civ V). Some observations about this game as it stands alone, now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way:

 - AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage, attack when it has the advantage, or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop, as in a real-life war. Nope. Scattered, random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1-2 infantry or cavalry units, plus 1 artillery.
 - Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor, as one does in war, you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval, consuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things, it seems to be an either/or, all-or-nothing, hair-trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next, because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance, spectrum, or ""scoring"" to this system, as far as I can tell, contrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced."" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off.
 - Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly, you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses.
 - The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7-5930k and an i7-6850k, and on both, it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing, or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn, I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time, without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat.
 - The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game, I really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be made, and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders, but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology, like a ""self-reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking, while removing late game tedium.
 - The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads; military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages, no, it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game.
 - I like the districts mechanic in principle, but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost, or at the VERY least, there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial, commercial, or theater district in the future, before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders, each of which have strict, arbitrary requirements.) At the very least, there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile.
 - Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter.
 - Personally, I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraft, as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks, like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also, by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power, you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless, and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now.
 - Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game, since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer, but at the same time, you've got to ask, of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units, it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess, if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory, you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories, initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill.
 - In my experience, all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable), you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic, but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x, varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish.
 - City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state, or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked, and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city, all your units are immediately expelled from that territory, bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible.
 - So tired of hearing ""best not to aid that city state"" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one???
 - The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat, but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700, or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger), miss a lot of the boosts, and discover petroleum in 1960.

1336490,Against the Storm,"You know that feeling when you first set up a city, watch it grow, see it begin to thrive and all the planning you've been doing go into motion?  But you miscalculated, and now you have problems on your hand to fix.  But that's okay, because you have a variety of tools to solve them and you know them well.  Pretty soon, you're able to conquer the obstacles and your small city develops into a bustling little metropolis.

What if that could be the entire game?  Start a city, set it up, tackle new challenges, adapt to your environment, struggle and win.  What would that be like?  Would it work?  Eremite seems to have asked that question.  Against the Storm is the answer.  And yes, it works very well.

You start in by choosing a place to settle, then from a limited and always-changing selection of resources.  As you become more experienced, the game develops alongside you.  You unlock new structures, new bonuses, new mechanics, but the game gets commeasurably more difficult.  The more you bump up the difficulty, the faster you unlock more toys to play with.  The pace of the game is always set by you.

The developers didn't make this game to make money.  I mean, I'm sure they're glad to get paid, but they've designed something that they're proud of and every new update is a step in an even cooler direction.  You get the sense that these are people who are making this game because it's the game they've always wanted to play.  Every change they make improves the experience for the player, because they're players, too, and they want to see Against the Storm get better and better despite the difficulty of marrying the Roguelite and Citybuilding genres into a cohesive - and, most importantly, fun - gameplay experience.

The game puts you in control.  It respects your abilities and capacity to learn.  It doesn't hold your hand, but neither does it crush you under the weight of an insurmountable burden.  All the information is there exactly when you need it, because you get to decide when you need that information.  And when you get confident in your mastery of the tools given to you, there's always another notch higher you can ratchet things up to see just how good you've gotten at keeping these little critters alive.

I didn't think I would like this game, but there's a lot to love here.  Runs great on Deck, by the way, with solid FPS at positively miniscule wattage.  Get it.  Get it at full price.  You'll thank yourself for it.  Even if you're not even remotely into city-builders, you're still going to have a great time defiantly plopping down sanctuaries for woodland creatures deep into a forest that hates them.

It's wonderful to see a developer so deeply invested in the quality of their product.  Give it a shot and I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion.

Now if you'll excuse me, another huge update just dropped and I can hardly wait to see what's next.",know feeling first set city watch grow see begin thrive planning go motion miscalculated problem hand fix okay variety tool solve know well pretty soon able conquer obstacle small city develops bustling little metropolis could entire game start city set tackle new challenge adapt environment struggle win would like would work eremite seems asked question storm answer yes work well start choosing place settle limited always changing selection resource become experienced game develops alongside unlock new structure new bonus new mechanic game get commeasurably difficult bump difficulty faster unlock toy play pace game always set developer make game make money mean sure glad get paid designed something proud every new update step even cooler direction get sense people making game game always wanted play every change make improves experience player player want see storm get better better despite difficulty marrying roguelite citybuilding genre cohesive importantly fun gameplay experience game put control respect ability capacity learn hold hand neither crush weight insurmountable burden information exactly need get decide need information get confident mastery tool given always another notch higher ratchet thing see good gotten keeping little critter alive think would like game lot love run great deck way solid fps positively miniscule wattage get get full price thank even even remotely city builder still going great time defiantly plopping sanctuary woodland creature deep forest hate wonderful see developer deeply invested quality product give shot sure come conclusion excuse another huge update dropped hardly wait see next

1599340,Lost Ark,"Two months ago all of my characters disappeared.

Then after talking to three people I was able to get the ticket reopened. It has been another month and a half and still no reply from the devs other than they are ""looking in to it rest assured"".

If you have any issues with this game don't expect them to get resolved since the support from Smilegate is beyond a joke. The only people you can talk to are AGS intermediaries reading off a sheet of responses.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,"I love this game with everything in me. Honest to god, its one of my favorite games of all time. I have ADHD, and so it can be hard for me to stay interested in a game for a long period of time, but not this one. I can easily sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game and it'll always be so much fun. However, there's a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Greed, and Laziness. The developers are fairly lazy. There's bugs in the game that have existed for many many years now. The same bugs in the old game, on the new one. If they built it from the ground up again, how could that be? It seems to me like they got lazy, and started copy and pasting code or something. If you're not sure the remake is worth 40$, rest assured, it isn't. Unless you have a really powerful computer, you're gonna have to end up playing on low settings anyways. A remaster with the same bugs and issues, years and years later. How can you call that a remaster? Disgraceful. We also have to talk about the greed. While i still feel wildcard is greedy, i don't think they're actually that bad. The real problem is their parent company snail games, as well as their server provider nitrado. Snail games is incredibly greedy. They please their shareholders by making pump and dump survival games, that they always eventually abandon. Ark is their golden goose. Its the one they put the most care into upholding. Yet they still shit in everyone's cereal, constantly. Don't forget that this remaster was going to be free. There's even been fiasco's in the past where snail games employees get raided, and they just ban the people who raided them off of the official server network. However the greediest of them all, is 100% without a doubt nitrado. Basically to sum it all up, wildcard was in debt and needed servers. Nitrado offered to loan them servers, but they wanted to exclusive rights for server hosting on Ark Survival Ascended. Wildcard obliged, and so now nitrado holds a complete monopoly over server hosting. The CHEAPEST server you can buy is 25$ a month for 20 slots. If you know anything about renting servers, you'll know thats pretty abhorrent. Thats incredibly expensive for servers that run like absolute dogshit anyways. Constant Rubber-Banding, teleporting all of the place, rollbacks, insane amounts of lag so much so offical network is literally unplayable for me right now. I'm supposed to live about 150 miles away from where the server is hosted, yet i always get 150 ping on NA servers. Its atrocious. I know snail games will never change their greedy ways, but i can at least hope the server hosting situation gets sorted because at this point i can't afford to host a server for just me and a few friends. And even if i could, it would suck anyways. If you wanna buy it, i totally get the appeal. But do not support this kind of behavior. Wait till its on sale, or the issues have been fixed. I love Ark, it just deserves better management.",love game everything honest god one favorite game time adhd hard stay interested game long period time one easily sink hundred hundred hour game always much fun however serious issue need addressed greed laziness developer fairly lazy bug game existed many many year bug old game new one built ground could seems like got lazy started copy pasting code something sure remake worth 40 rest assured unless really powerful computer gon na end playing low setting anyways remaster bug issue year year later call remaster disgraceful also talk greed still feel wildcard greedy think actually bad real problem parent company snail game well server provider nitrado snail game incredibly greedy please shareholder making pump dump survival game always eventually abandon ark golden goose one put care upholding yet still shit everyone cereal constantly forget remaster going free even fiasco past snail game employee get raided ban people raided official server network however greediest 100 without doubt nitrado basically sum wildcard debt needed server nitrado offered loan server wanted exclusive right server hosting ark survival ascended wildcard obliged nitrado hold complete monopoly server hosting cheapest server buy 25 month 20 slot know anything renting server know thats pretty abhorrent thats incredibly expensive server run like absolute dogshit anyways constant rubber banding teleporting place rollback insane amount lag much offical network literally unplayable right supposed live 150 mile away server hosted yet always get 150 ping na server atrocious know snail game never change greedy way least hope server hosting situation get sorted point afford host server friend even could would suck anyways wan na buy totally get appeal support kind behavior wait till sale issue fixed love ark deserves better management

518790,theHunter: Call of the Wild™,"[h1]Where IRL meets fantasy gaming[/h1] 
Really, the outdoors experience in this open world sand box hunting sim is so like being in the great outdoors that most sessions I forget I’m gaming. I often even forget the fact that I’m looking for achievements in the game. And, for a gamer who enjoys the thrill of capturing every single achievie, that’s a big deal. It is the total world immersion that makes the experience of COTW so impressive. I’ve only been playing for 3 weeks, but at the time of writing the review I have 60% of the achievements and almost 200 hours in game. I am already the ‘Hero of Hirschfelden’ and ‘Lord of the Lakes’ because I’ve explored the total area of both maps. (*Mumbles to self in monologue-ing voice: “I like that. Yes I like that very much.”) The missions are challenging enough that it will be awhile before I finish them all. So, time in game is almost unlimited. I can’t see a stopping point yet.

[b]UPDATE: Edited to remove problem with using 2nd monitor, since the latest patch 1.11.2 this works just fine. Thanks EW for the frequent updates & for listening to the community needs.[/b]

 [b]Story Lore/ Music & Sound:[/b]
I often think of the game as a mountain climbing sim with hunting opportunities. Of course, that’s because I’ve often wished for a sim for climbing mountains. And, the challenge of discovering all the sights modeled after real-life geographical landforms: archipelago, butte, canyon, gorge, volcano, and much more, is all very alluring. But, many natural points of interest are integrated into the maps, providing a history or lore to these fictional maps that matches their real-life counterparts. You are able to climb every mountain in the game. You can explore totem memorials and abandoned ruins and collect artifacts. The sound effects immerse you in the outdoor world, and the music is lovely. Every area of the map is crafted with painstaking detail that provides eye-catching splendor to each sunrise and sunset.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Much of the fun gameplay comes in with tracking the animals, for hunting and for photography with the cinematic camera in the controls. The controls are all very simple, and can be keymapped for ease of use. I like the run toggle so you don’t have to hold down W. I changed the E use key to mouse 5, so that when I’m tracking I can run toggle and use the mouse to navigate and click to read the tracks as I’m running. The overlay provides mapping and a codex that stores all your accumulated knowledge of the world you’ve discovered.  

The day/night cycle is 4 times the speed of in real life. So you have 3 real time hours of darkness to immerse in the nightlife of the woods, as well as those daytime hours. Many outposts are scattered throughout the maps, and provide access to your storage, the in-game store, and a sleep point. Sleeping allows you to move time ahead in hours. Setting it to 18:00 for example, would make it sundown if you want to hunt at night. But, each time you sleep costs in-game money, making it a bit more of a challenge. 

Your character and your atv can take damage. Creatures stampede and can hurt you. But, ‘death’ only resets your character at a sleep point & you lose nothing. Atvs are unlimited. Abandoning one at the foot of a mountain is nothing. You can retrieve it at the next outpost, or even pitch a tent, and summon one up. Tents have a limit that seems to be about 7 or so on each reserve. With fast travel, you are able to move from tent to tent if you wanted to be in another location to hunt at dark. I like to explore in the daytime, and hunt at sunset, sunrise, and nighttime. 

[b]Tracking and missions[/b]
Throughout the world you come across animal need zones and tracks. These can be ‘read’ to give information about when the animal species was last there and often how many animals were in that location. Returning to that spot at the same time will allow you to encounter that species, whether for hunting or photography. Multiple arcs of missions are imbedded in the single player to allow the option of structured gameplay, for those who want more than just simple run and gun type game play. Of course, even the most hobbit-like adventurers like me, who love to wander around the countryside seeing all the sites and animals, love to find a cozy spot on a rock overlooking a canyon and accumulate a few carcasses down below before climbing down to harvest them all.

[b]The Shooter Experience:[/b] 
COTW has a range of weapons that you feel sufficiently motivated to collect for hunting every species. Of course, more is always better, when it comes to weapons in game. More would be even better. It also has lures, ammo, and other gear for hunting. Scattered around the countryside are woodpiles for building permanent ground blinds using in-game currency. These provide more experience points for the skills & perk trees as well. The skill & perk trees provide a good range of skills to work toward increased hunting experience for the current 60 max of levels. These add abilities such as gauging the weather, and improved tracking skills. 

DLC expansions added ATV’s and tents and ground blinds. I’m not sure, but it looks as if these can be purchased eventually with in-game funds as an alternative, though it would take a lot of time. Either way, 4 bucks is the cheapest expansion dlc I’ve seen. And, the ATVs are an awesome part of the hunting and exploration. And, the tents allow portable base access; functioning like the permanent outposts throughout the maps. Personally, I’d love to see the addition of boats and fishing. But, that is just a wishlist item. I see no cons to this game.

[b]The Diversity of Animal Life:[/b]
The game is inspired by the book, Call of the Wild by Jack London. Like the book, the game reveals much about the lives and behaviors of animals, and the great outdoors. Many species are integrated into the world of the current two reserves in Germany and America: Black Bears, Roosevelt Elks, Red Foxes, Coyotes, European Bison, Wild Boar, Moose, Red Deer, Fallow Deer, Roe Deer, Whitetail Deer, and Blacktail Deer. Besides the typical colors, several rare & albino furs appear randomly. The upcoming dlc expansion will add a third reserve in Siberia: Medved, with snow and an anticipated new selection of animals such as the already revealed Lynx. 

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
I was in Scouting myself at an early age, and later an Explorer’s Post as a young adult. I’ve enjoyed the fun of group campouts with my sons in the cub scouts over the course of a decade & the numerous camping trips with families & friends over the years, and even group & solitary hiking & camping experiences. But, I’ve never been hunting myself. As great of an experience as solitary hiking & camping can be, friendship is a huge part of the outdoors. COTW provides a smooth multiplayer experience, where you can either create your own server game, or jump in with already created servers. All outposts & locations unlocked in singleplayer are also available for quick travel on the multiplayer maps. You can join your buddies for group cooperative hunts or compete in challenges. 

[b]Graphics:[/b]
I get 60fps steady & can play mp with crappy internet. No problems at all. Second monitor & the Steam overlay works great with COTW. You can even open vids in the overlay and listen while you shift/tab back into the game, which is really nice while sitting in a hunting stand in the dark waiting on the animal herd to arrive. 

[h1]Call of the Wild is a truly spectacular real world experience that takes all the quality of life improvements of computer video gaming and makes the outdoor life even better. [/h1] I highly recommend the game for animal lovers, fans of shooters, open sandbox, and sims.

2073850,THE FINALS,"I have played the beta, and am now playing for the release.  But all together, I wish their was more modes and that you could earn more rewards or atleast could spend VRs to get a crate or something to get cosmetics but with the lack of modes and stuff to earn.  One thing that has kept me busy is going for achievements.  I'm at 30 and will be at 40 within a few days.  

But the gameplay has something for everyone atleast.  You can go and support your team as if your a pocket mercy and just heal and use gadgets for damage or even try to be a ninja and use cloak or dash and the sword.  But the 1 thing that I feel like really makes the gameplay good for everyone is how it challenges people.  Not every fight is good or skillful, your able to get rocket launchered, die to a guy sniping from far away baiting people, you can be shot in the back by 3 guys and not be able to do anything.  But I wen't from wiffing and dying to being able to get kills with every class and win 1v3's and hold cashouts solo.  

To me the best games are the ones that can include stuff for everyone, has stuff to earn, and that can challenge you.  To me this game has plenty of options of classes weapons to fight with and a lot of challenging and good fights and matches.  I believe that more cosmetics and items to earn will come in the future so I have hope for the game and will keep playing it through.

1599340,Lost Ark,"If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you! Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead. Excited yet? You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job! Wait, there's more! If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content. That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of! Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside... This is a pay to win game. That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can. They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that. However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands. I'm serious, it's beyond insanity.

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you: it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content. You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up. It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players. All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression. Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character. Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too. The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold. What is gold good for? The Auction House. Upgrade items and gear. Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals. That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.

What the heck are Pheons? They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters. The gear you wear is what determines your item level. After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials. Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in. So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons? You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals. How do you get blue crystals? By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons. Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server. These bots have one goal - farm gold. Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue. It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag. Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.

You see the problem yet? Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value. Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK, that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups. Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies. There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum. Maybe as many as 60? I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid. Almost all of them are unnecessary.

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"Co-op joke.  Let me be clear, I'm reviewing this on the co-op experience only, as we bought this game as a group.

Let me preface this, by saying that Dying Light (the first one) was one of my favorite games I've ever played (minus the awful QTE ending).  I played solo and with a group of 3 others.  It had very few flaws.

Dying light 2 is a buggy joke.  I don't know wtf happened, but the quality control went straight down the toilet.  Audio bugs and zombies randomly appearing and disappearing.

The worst offense, is that unlocked weapons (crossbow) and upgrades (glider) are for the HOST ONLY.

This is not a competitive PvP game. There is no reason at all to lock these upgrades to the host only.  We're only maybe halfway through the game, and I have no desire to continue.

This franchise took a nose-dive, from the first game.  It should be advertised as single-player only. Don't bother playing with friends",co op joke let clear reviewing co op experience bought game group let preface saying dying light first one one favorite game ever played minus awful qte ending played solo group 3 others flaw dying light 2 buggy joke know wtf happened quality control went straight toilet audio bug zombie randomly appearing disappearing worst offense unlocked weapon crossbow upgrade glider host competitive pvp game reason lock upgrade host maybe halfway game desire continue franchise took nose dive first game advertised single player bother playing friend

1326470,Sons Of The Forest,"Sons of the Forest is a great game there is no doubt about that, and if you feel like you want to play the game then by all means go ahead, I did and I enjoyed it, but if ever there was a time to wait for a game to come out of Early Access it would be now. As someone who enjoyed The Forest far more than I could have expected I had very high expectation for Sons of the Forest, but sadly I think SOTF is just not there yet, and here’s why…

1 – The Island
From what I’ve been able to gather is seems that the general consensus is that SOTF’s map is roughly 5 times bigger than that of The Forest, but bigger isn’t always better. I don’t recall a single time in The Forest when I felt like I was losing out on anything because I had to travel across the map. Though the map was much smaller, it was balanced for the amount of content the game offered and nothing was ever really “too far” away. At this point in time there just isn’t enough content in SOTF to justify such a large map. Surprisingly there are about half as many caves as there were in The Forest, at least for the time being, of course they’ve added bunkers but even then we only get a handful. Don’t get me wrong, the game looks AMAZING, but when everything is so far away that it takes you half an hour to run across the map it will eventually start to wear on you.

2 – The Caves
One of the most iconic aspects of The Forest was its intricate intertwining cave system that could be easily accessed from almost any part of the map thanks to its many cave entrances. You could venture into the darkness and emerge almost anywhere on the map depending on how far you went, this made everything feel connected and really helped tie the islands overworld together with its cave system. Not only that but finding certain equipment could help you dive even further into the depths of darkness which in turn upped the danger levels as you delved further and further… well, this is gone now. In SOTF each cave is its own standalone cave, many times with the exit being only a few meters away from its entrance. Not only that but most of the times the caves don’t really pose any type of threat, either they’re completely empty and you can just run through them, or they’re filled to the brim with mutants and you can still just run right through them because there’s nothing limiting your progress through the caves. Worst of all is that most of the caves in SOTF just aren’t memorable, I feel the reason for this is mostly because after looting a cave there’s really no reason to come back, you get the main loot from the cave and that’s it, that cave is done and you never have to visit it again which sucks.

3 – The Survival
While this might be a bug and unintentional, as the game stands now it allows you to re-loot absolutely everything in the game, suitcases included, making it so you never have to worry about running out of supplies. Now I know that this was also a thing in The Forest, but it only applied to items in caves and some very basic overworld items (yet another reason you don’t need to return to the caves). That and the many duplication glitches that currently plague the game make it so you never really have to worry about survival. Wanna build a house? You can build a mansion by just chopping down one tree and using a stick. Ran out of ammo/grenades/crafting materials? Just save and reload next to a camp as many times as you need till you top off everything. Also, did I mention that the end-game armor is infinite? That’s right, you will never run out of armor, and even the best armor can be fully crafted early to mid-game after restarting a few times in the correct bunker. Not to mention that our friend Kelvin offers a never-ending supply of fish so you’ll never go hungry again. Basically, you never have to worry about surviving in this game, hell you don’t even need a base, everything you need will fit in your backpack, and even if you do go hungry or get thirsty you don’t really get punished for doing so. 

4 – The Story
This is probably what hurt the most for me, while The Forest didn’t have much of a story per se, once you reached the end you got enough of an explanation for everything to make sense. In SOTF however, the ending is so bizarre and non-sensical that it just leaves you confused as to who everyone is and where they came from. It wasn’t until I went onto Youtube and found someone who put in the time to do the detective work and piece everything together that I was finally able to understand a bit, and even then, it was just an interpretation of the events that happened, you really have to stretch your imagination for everything to make sense.

Now don’t get me wrong, in spite of all of these issues I’m fully aware that the game is in early access and thus not complete, and while I did enjoy the experience during my first playthrough I can’t help but think of all the possibilities of how much more the game can improve during this early access phase and how I could have had a much more enjoyable experience in a complete game, because you only get one chance at a first playthrough. Sons of the Forest has all the potential to surpass The Forest, but as the game stands it just isn’t there yet.

413150,Stardew Valley,"I remember buying this game for my brother a few years back. Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift.
Last September he committed suicide.
After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley.
He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs. Most of all, however, we're all just happy to be together.",remember buying game brother year back think much time thought would nice gift remember seeing playing time time message indicating started playing popping corner screen always certain small pride seeing meant enjoying gift last september committed suicide everything le settled sat booted computer chrome steam word game one course stardew valley played game piece clocking 170 hour owning practically everything game offer used every square inch maximum potential making ridiculous amount cash see much loved present game played quite captured affection much one none friend really knew however seems like preferred keep like little bit heaven could turn whenever wanted help smile whenever play game recommend enough every bit hard work developer put masterpiece show every single aspect music catchy memorable ofetn find humming certain tune world feel lived natural gameplay incredibly laid back enjoyable hard stop get invested game minute easily turn several hour multiplayer beta play even longer friend u dedicated desired job however happy together

- Excellent visual design: the 40K world is transposed in all its brutality, grimdark ambiance and bleakness.

- Great variety of weapons, abilities, perks and equipment to adapt any class to your preferred playstyle.

- High challenge level on the last two settings, that requires skill, coordination and quick thinking to overcome.

- Solid overall content amount for completionists and hardcore ‘100%’ players.
[/td]
[td]
- High amount of bugs and balance issues across the board, from classes to weapons, enemy stats and bosses.

- Significant missing content that was -promised- on release, with no ETA in sight. The devs even stopped updates in favor of bug fixing recently. This isn’t Early Access on paper, but it factually is.

- Bland, uninteresting story and insipid characters that are a massive step back from what was seen in the Vermintide series.

- Levels look good, but also too same-y in most cases, lack iconic locations and feel generic in terms of ambiance / design.

[td]The amount of time you’ll get out of Darktide is largely dependent on the objectives you set for yourself.

[td][b]Is it worth buying?[/b][/td]
[td]Not in the current state. Considering it’s not ‘early access’ and had multiple betas, the current amount of bugs, gameplay issues and missing content isn’t acceptable for this production level. In a year or so, and on sale, things may be different - time will tell.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
“In the grim darkness of the future, there is only war”. This iconic statement perfectly sums up the mood and tone of games based on Warhammer 40K; Darktide is no exception. Set in the labyrinthine, endlessly-stacked levels of a Hive World, Atoma Prime, it puts you in the shoes of one of four conscripts that, instead of jail time, were sent to fight for the Imperium in borderline-suicidal missions. Be it solo with (not so competent) bots or alongside other players online, you’ll fight against the forces of Chaos and related sub-cults.

Instead of having iconic, named characters as seen in previous Fatshark installments such as Vermintide, this time around you’ll be able to create fully-customized ones. This gives more flexibility, but at a high cost: the quirky, charismatic personalities of well-written characters are in fact lost in Darktide, replaced by insipid, cringy archetypes that try to be “one size fits all” and fail quite spectacularly at that.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
Exceptions made for some more open levels set on the surface or into the living quarters, the bulk of them takes place in the cramped, dark bowels of the Hive City, infested to the brim with scum of all kinds. Other than the main path to follow, the numerous side rooms often house additional supplies, resources for crafting / upgrading and Grimoires, dangerous pickups that constantly degrade the party’s health, but give a better reward if you manage to carry them all the way to the end. Too bad this ‘bonus’ is rather miserable and isn’t worth the hindrance. 

Objective indicators and pings keep attention up and give a sense of direction; granted, levels aren’t extensive or elaborate enough to get you lost, also thanks to numerous one-way drops that prevent excessive backtracking. The level design in general is fine, however there’s too much similarity in locations and ambiance in several instances: few levels in fact truly feel unique and distinct. A major flaw is found in the level selection system, which doesn’t allow selecting any level at any time like any sanely-developed game would, but instead cycles a pool of them set on predetermined difficulties. Emperor forbid people being allowed to play what they want, when they want!

[h3]Combat System & Classes[/h3]
Darktide remains a melee-focused FPS, even if much greater emphasis was given to the ranged weapons department this time around. Players will be able to use heavy and light attacks with their melee tool of choice free of charge, plus special modes if present (such as charging a Power weapon) however Stamina will be used to block attacks, dodge and perform some other actions. Ranged weapons are limited in ammo, and serve different purposes depending on the type: plasma guns are better against heavy hitters, flamethrowers excel against hordes and so on. 

The “normals-specials' ' dichotomy is maintained, with fodder being omnipresent in the form of ambient and horde foes, with specials spawning from time to time, each with their own abilities, skills and weak points. Bosses are a rarer spawn, and honestly not that much of a threat unless supported by other enemies; slow and cumbersome, they can be kited rather easily in my experience.

Each character will feature a Toughness bar - take it as a shield that recharges over time and protects from damage before Health is consumed - staying close to friendlies enhances the regen, an incentive to not go alone. All of them have their own passive traits, one special ‘ultimate ability’ and unique weapons to progressively unlock. KO too many times and you’ll have to respawn after a delay, and be saved by the remaining companions.

If the core combat is the true-and-tested Vermintide formula, a metric ton of bugs and balance issues make it much less enjoyable. From snipers shooting you through solid walls to a couple weapons overclassing all others in terms of power, the design issues are many, and will take a long time to solve, if ever. Almost forgotten, the Psyker class is completely underpowered trash at higher difficulties, with no fix in sight to this day.

[h3]Character Progression & Equipment[/h3]
Each level rewards XP, currency and some materials you can use to upgrade your weapons at the dedicated terminals. Other currency types are exclusive to weekly challenges and “penances”, both being challenge types with specific requirements. The weekly ones are always on a timer, so those with less time to dedicate will be penalized as they constantly reset, while Penances have no timer but often feature weird requirements that incentive -playing in a bad way- rather than excelling at the game. It’s not rare to have players ruin a run only because of ‘penance farming’.

Each weapon type, be it axes or lasguns or shotguns, has different variants with alternate fire modes, bonuses and so on, but at the end of the day you’ll go for the best accuracy and damage, because spamming a thousand bullets is meaningless if you don’t hit. With one melee and one ranged weapon each, characters have options when it comes to their role in the field, and a coordinated team may choose who takes care of the rabble and who focuses on specials and bosses. This type of team is almost mandatory to clear the higher difficulties, as randoms simply won’t cut it.",h1 sum h1 h3 depth analysis h3 table tr th b pro b th th b con b th tr tr td excellent visual

105600,Terraria,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.

As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building. 

There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform. 

After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.

The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.

With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.

I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.

1129580,Medieval Dynasty,"I wish Steam had a star system. This game would be 3 out of 5. There are some issues I was really hoping would be resolved by release, so I waited for v1.0 before posting a review. 

The good:
1. It can be a very zen / peaceful game
2. I love the survival and building aspect
3. They did a great job on immersion for many aspects of the game. They obviously put a lot of time into the various jobs, related animations, resources, etc. which is great.
4. The character isn't super human which really helps with the realism and immersion.
5. Overall it's a lighthearted story with potential (but... see below)
6. The music sets the mood without being annoying
7. I love that they added bandits since it adds a bit of motivation to improve weapons and skills

Where it falls short in my opinion:
1. One of the strengths quickly becomes a weakness. It can be a peaceful game, but there is an overall lack of motivating elements in the story and game in general. Why am I building the village vs just wandering around looking for my uncle? Why go through the trouble of managing buildings and people when I can get through the whole story without the trouble. While I may like to do these things, it's helpful to feel a NEED to do it based on the story or some environmental element. It needs a better carrot or stick, reward or consequence... or both.
2. The story is clumsy in its current state and could seriously use a proof read.
3. The interactions with NPC's are not great. For example, when my wife is at 100% affection and happy she still sounds angry every time she says goodbye.
4. Some skills are very hard to advance in without serious grinding (e.g. Diplomacy)
5. Some of the tech and buildings are strangely misaligned. e.g. How can I build a giant storage building but not a tavern? Why must I have a stable to have a mule? Why can't I have a simple wheelbarrow/hand cart in mines or to carry stones and clay? Why do I need an entire log to make a plate?
6. Some of the UI mechanics are inconsistent and hard to find. e.g. there are nice radial menus for building, but when you want to switch wall types, for example, you have to switch to an upgrade menu off the hammer, face a wall and press E. I went an entire play-through without realizing I could start a building off with stone walls. User error? Maybe. But this isn't the only example.
7. There is some good behavioral coding, but some things are weirdly out of place. e.g. why can't my villagers get their own water from the well vs. me having someone do it or doing it myself? This is more obvious because some of the other aspects are done well. When you run into one of these odd ones they really stick out.
8. It's still not clear to me why I care about Dynasty Points other than for village size.

For the motivation aspect, it seems there are some unfinished plans with mention of a war, dynasty points which could be used to evolve status/skills/story in some way, and maybe even have the bandits attack the village at some point which would encourage me to build it up and build walls and other defenses. What about traders between towns or with ""kingdoms"" off the map""?

Overall I like the potential of the game (which is why I bought it in pre-release). I just wish they had resolved some of the items I consider pretty basic/obvious before launch. The motivation element and balancing some of the skills/resource gathering/tech better would go a long way to making this a strong recommendation.

Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it!
Still, I can live with all of the above...

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. 
You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"".  What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore.

The best game ever created.",best game ever created
2344520,Diablo® IV,"[h1]No thanks… Just give us D2R on Steam instead.[/h1]


[b]Level Scaling:[/b] The game has scale with level, resulting in every area feeling the same. Since mobs from the very start of the game and late in the game will always be your level, it eliminates the feeling of power, progression, and fear. Fear of going to certain areas unprepared and getting stomped on, and then the feeling of power and progression when returning later to find out that you did better than your first attempt because your character has become stronger. Because every enemy is balanced to your level, there is none of that. It’s like if prices in the real world would scale with your salary to the exact amount, so no matter how hard you work or how much overtime you put in, by the end you won’t have more money than you started with because everything just became that much more expensive.

[b]Story & Setting:[/b] The game’s setting and story is a joke compared to Diablo 2. Diablo 4 promised a dark story with a dark gothic setting, yet it delivered very poorly on that. The story is just uninteresting and non-existent most of the game. Where in Diablo 1 and 2 most quests had a deep story and most NPCs had their own opinion or insight on a specific quest, with a lot of dialogue to be listened to if the player desired it, there is non of that in Diablo 4. Like most bosses don’t even have a backstory, they are just there, waiting to be killed. Though the dark gothic tone of the game is a lot better than what they did with Diablo 3, it still falls short compared to DIablo 1 and 2. The npcs in both Diablo 1 and 2 had great, detailed and spooky stories to tell about their own experiences and about horrible things that had happen to people they once knew or what horrible things people they once knew had done to their world. I miss that.  

[b]Openworld & Worlddesign:[/b] Open world was an interesting idea, unfortunately it just doesn’t fit a Diable game. Every biome and enemy looks somewhat similar and because there are no real act’s anymore, you often won’t even notice when you enter a new area, there again is no real feeling of progression and no excitement at all for killing the final boss of that act. I still remember the first time i killed Andariel in Diablo 2 and i could travel to Lut Gholein for the first time, it was really exciting, and everything in that new area was and felt brand new. New items, New enemies, a brand new theme and setting, with new stories and quests that felt a lot different from the last act. You will get non of that in Diablo 4, its just the same shit through the entire game.

[b]Loot:[/b] Loot disappointed me the most. All items no matter what they are take up the same amount of space in your inventory, so the inventory management skill we have all been training for more than two decades in Diablo 2 is now useless. The items also all look very similar and very generic. Even though there also were instances in Diablo 2 where god-tier items had the exact same look as items that would be found in the very start of the game, it is not to the same scale as it is in Diablo 4. In Diablo 4 almost every item just looks plain and boring and when you mix that with every item having the same size in the inventory, it just becomes so dull to look at. After a few hours, it just becomes a brown-greyish mush of colors. It also feels boring and slow to grind for loot in Diablo 4. I’m not actually sure why that is; I just didn’t have any exciting moments in the game or at least in the early game where I found an item of particular interest that excited me. 

[b]Runewords & Ethereal items:[/b] The game doesn’t have runewords or ethereal items, two of the most interesting and gameplay impactful things from Diablo 2. It’s mind-boggling to me why this isn’t a thing in Diablo 4. Runewords made crafting and character building fun and exciting and ethereal items made it possible to create very unique builds and were the standard weapons and armors for mercenaries, which are also not a thing in Diablo 4. 

[b]Gold:[/b] is pretty much worthless now. Your only need for gold is for upgrading, crafting elixirs, and buying from vendors. The problem is that vendor prices also scale with your level, so gathering gold and completing quests won’t really make you richer. Vendors will charge you more when they see how successful you are and since your items won’t scale with your level (only mobs and vendor prices will), what they sell is mostly useless. In Diablo 2 the three primary reasons for hunting gold were repair cost on end-game characters, reviving your mercenary and gambling, but in Diablo 4 you no longer use gold for gambling; they made a new currency just for that. And mercenaries are not a thing in Diablo 4. So that leaves repair cost as the only other thing to save up for which makes it a lot less desirable to hunt for.

[b]Hardcore Mode:[/b] Hardcore mode is totally busted in Diablo 4. If you disconnect or your game crashes while you are playing, say goodbye to your character. DC’s and crashes instantly kill your HC character. You also can’t run from boss fights anymore; the game will lock you in a small area with a boss that you won’t be able to escape. So, you better hope you are strong enough if you randomly run into one.”

[b]Camera Angle:[/b] The camera view makes you feel so close to your character; it makes me feel almost claustrophobic and I keep trying to zoom out to no avail - very frustrating.

[b]Mercenaries:[/b] Like previously mentioned, the game offers no mercenaries for hire; this limits build creativity and forces people to build builds that can survive on their own, which in my opinion makes it a lot less fun.",h1 thanks give u d2r steam instead h1 b level scaling b game scale level resulting every area feeling since mob start game late game always level eliminates feeling power progression fear fear going certain area unprepared getting stomped feeling power progression returning later find better first attempt character become stronger every enemy balanced level none like price real world would scale salary exact amount matter hard work much overtime put end money started everything became much expensive b story setting b game setting story joke compared diablo 2 diablo 4 promised dark story dark gothic setting yet delivered poorly story uninteresting non existent game diablo 1 2 quest deep story npc opinion insight specific quest lot dialogue listened player desired non diablo 4 like boss even backstory waiting killed though dark gothic tone game lot better diablo 3 still fall short compared diablo 1 2 npc diablo 1 2 great detailed spooky story tell experience horrible thing happen people knew horrible thing people knew done world miss b openworld worlddesign b open world interesting idea unfortunately fit diable game every biome enemy look somewhat similar real act anymore often even notice enter new area real feeling progression excitement killing final bos act still remember first time killed andariel diablo 2 could travel lut gholein first time really exciting everything new area felt brand new new item new enemy brand new theme setting new story quest felt lot different last act get non diablo 4 shit entire game b loot b loot disappointed item matter take amount space inventory inventory management skill training two decade diablo 2 useless item also look similar generic even though also instance diablo 2 god tier item exact look item would found start game scale diablo 4 diablo 4 almost every item look plain boring mix every item size inventory becomes dull look hour becomes brown greyish mush color also feel boring slow grind loot diablo 4 actually sure exciting moment game least early game found item particular interest excited b runewords ethereal item b game runewords ethereal item two interesting gameplay impactful thing diablo 2 mind boggling thing diablo 4 runewords made crafting character building fun exciting ethereal item made possible create unique build standard weapon armor mercenary also thing diablo 4 b gold b pretty much worthless need gold upgrading crafting elixir buying vendor problem vendor price also scale level gathering gold completing quest really make richer vendor charge see successful since item scale level mob vendor price sell mostly useless diablo 2 three primary reason hunting gold repair cost end game character reviving mercenary gambling diablo 4 longer use gold gambling made new currency mercenary thing diablo 4 leaf repair cost thing save make lot le desirable hunt b hardcore mode b hardcore mode totally busted diablo 4 disconnect game crash playing say goodbye character dc crash instantly kill hc character also run bos fight anymore game lock small area bos able escape better hope strong enough randomly run one b camera angle b camera view make feel close character make feel almost claustrophobic keep trying zoom avail frustrating b mercenary b like previously mentioned game offer mercenary hire limit build creativity force people build build survive opinion make lot le fun

1190000,Car Mechanic Simulator 2021,"I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of this game. As a professional mechanic for 6 years and a lifetime automotive enthusiast, I can say this game fully satisfies those interests. It takes all the aspects that I loved about being a mechanic and leaves out things I hated, while also adding in all the things I love about cars as a hobby. The cars and parts are detailed and accurate, but also simplified so as not to become totally unmanageable. The visuals are beautiful, and it's so rewarding to see the results of an old rust bucket being fully restored. 

I would say I'm 100% the target audience for a game like this, but I think a lot of people who wouldn't expect to like a game like this would actually find enjoyment out of it, and you don't need any prior automotive experience or education. The process is intuitive and systematic enough that anyone would be able to do the work / play the game. For those with no background knowledge, I think this would be a fun way to become familiar with how cars are put together.

To the team: 

Thank you very much for your efforts putting together such a great game!

281990,Stellaris,"Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.

This is the story of those 20 hours.

My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took ""Spiritualist,"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.

It wasn't deep enough.

I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.

I had to go deeper

I found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions.""  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.

My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.  

And we were all so, so happy.

But we needed more friends.

So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.

I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.

Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.
And I have no regrets.

Update from 5/11:

I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.

My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.

The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.

The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.

My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.

That's when we saved and quit until next time:
In summary:
I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.",edit writing review 20 hour logged stellaris stellaris 29 hour story 20 hour friend arranged play stellaris together release know play remembered happiness core game mechanic unhappy people rebel happy people want rebellion make people even unhappy took spiritualist get nice 5 bonus happiness even better grabbed fanatic spiritualist get whopping 10 bonus happiness worry rebellion ever deep enough found communal trait add 5 happiness charismatic trait give everyone planet 1 happiness bonus every member race planet go deeper found balancing racial attribute national ethic even form government able get total 25 boost happiness ended fanatically spiritual pacifistic race charming people like getting along everyone top found fitting racial portrait classic grey alien kind see old movie tv clip alien abduction classic gray big doofy grin slapped permanently across face friend started opposite side galaxy stuck surrounded sea ai matter people remained happy manipulated neighbor pitted gain created superalliance angry fungus neighbor invaded bird restricting movement distributing across empire stripping away power influence even homeworld shipped across empire balancing grinning populace across empire live kind world happy needed friend found primitive achieved spaceflight yet set research post began lightly observing course began process bringing speed rest galactic community genetically modified boar happy game friend politicking side galaxy making breaking alliance power struggle send ripple far enough seen effect corner galaxy spent time well genetically modifying subjugated alien empire happy like u thanks game awake 40 hour final week regret update 5 11 managed explore around unexplored chunk outer rim finding several friend meanwhile enlightened 2 specie working 3rd saved quit fully integrated empire quickly bothered modify one naturally happy alliance angry fungus expanded addition super xenophile cat neighbor fully 1 3 galaxy cat people population quickly migrated planet set productive happy result surrounded people engineering would actually waste resource alien loving cat angry fungus immediately set molding corner galaxy nation mirror invading liberating planet new government set sympathetic ethic entire time friend wailing moaning much gnashing teeth slowly ground non player empire consistently thrashing army 15 year war managed research better shield system counter powerful laser turn tide war secure white peace friend joe lucky secure alliance rest friend side galaxy non player empire declared war joe took one planet liberated another new government vassalized saved quit next time summary slowly increasing power enlightening race blissful happiness friend constantly war joe getting vassalized non player empire

1062090,Timberborn,"My original beaver colony was doing absolutely amazing. Was up to 96 beavers, producing metal, books, almost everything in the tech tree. Several droughts had come and gone but I barely noticed them with how well my dam and water supplies held out. And then the big one came, a drought that lasted just a little bit longer than I was ready for. The dam dried up. The water stopped pumping. My little guys were drinking from the reserves until those, too, ran dry. A day and a half before the drought ended beavers started to die from dehydration. As some died it made room in the houses, and they started having babies. The next generation ready to take over after the drought. But it went for just too long. In the last hours of the drought, my last adult beaver died off. The river came back though! And the 8 babies had survived it. The ran around like crazy, playing on the carousel, chasing each other down the streets. Working up a big thirst. But, none of them were big enough to pump the water. They were growing fast though, would they become adults in time?? As the day went the dehydration started to hit them hard and the first died off. The others ran around in a panic, working up a bigger and bigger thirst, until they too fell to the ground, licking the sand for any little bit of moisture it might have. As night fell on the second day after the drought the town lay still and quiet.

1062090,Timberborn,"I am completely in love with this game. Colony sims are one of my favorite genres, and having one with no combat focused on hydro engineering and irrigation starring adorable sapient beavers is just wonderful.

The gameplay is wonderful. I love being able to stack buildings and invent solutions to water management. I look forward to the updates adding more factions and buildings in the near future.

My wishlist for improving this game for anyone interested:
1: Ability to hold shift when placing a building to automatically mark the paths/bushes/crops/saplings for demolition, and still allow you to place building blueprints on stuff marked for demolition. - having to manually delete paths is particularly annoying,
2: Ability to shift click multiple buildings in order to pause/unpause them at the same time.
3: Ability to cycle through all buildings of the same type through the map, e.g. so you can find all your gatherers huts to pause them

(I'm a game dev and I know how annoying unsolicited ideas can be, so feel free to skip the rest, but this game just has me excited at the future possibilities)

Some buildings that would be nice to have, maybe for other factions 
A horsepower-powered water pump that doesn't need a beaver worker
A block that can let water pass through it but can have levees placed on it (for building aqueducts that aren't also dams)

A more aquatic-based faction (my guess is this is probably already on the planning table) that 
*Has a crop that grows better on flooded tiles (rice, cattails, waterlillies or something)
*A fun/social ""building"" that is just a water-polo field for beavers to play with a floating wooden ball (this would be adorable)
*Has lodges similar to real beavers, where the entrance can be placed underwater but the top is above water (and resists flooding unless totally submerged)
Maybe has more automated ways of pumping water uphill(?)

I'd also love to see the Irontooth beavers add another way to get metal, and to have a horsepower-enhanced advanced research building that worked faster.

Maybe some factions could have a power-storage device like a huge metal flywheel or Pumped Storage Hydropower, this would help a lot with making wind and water power more steady in the late game. Most colony sims have you researching batteries, and mechanical energy storage solutions seem fitting for both the genre and the setting.",completely love game colony sims one favorite genre one combat focused hydro engineering irrigation starring adorable sapient beaver wonderful gameplay wonderful love able stack building invent solution water management look forward update adding faction building near future wishlist improving game anyone interested 1 ability hold shift placing building automatically mark path bush crop sapling demolition still allow place building blueprint stuff marked demolition manually delete path particularly annoying 2 ability shift click multiple building order pause unpause time 3 ability cycle building type map e g find gatherer hut pause game dev know annoying unsolicited idea feel free skip rest game excited future possibility building would nice maybe faction horsepower powered water pump need beaver worker block let water pas levee placed building aqueduct also dam aquatic based faction guess probably already planning table crop grows better flooded tile rice cattail waterlillies something fun social building water polo field beaver play floating wooden ball would adorable lodge similar real beaver entrance placed underwater top water resists flooding unless totally submerged maybe automated way pumping water uphill also love see irontooth beaver add another way get metal horsepower enhanced advanced research building worked faster maybe faction could power storage device like huge metal flywheel pumped storage hydropower would help lot making wind water power steady late game colony sims researching battery mechanical energy storage solution seem fitting genre setting

238960,Path of Exile,"I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding.  The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers.  They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions.  I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon.  Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time.

Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system,  the other large appeal of this game is the end-game.  Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content.  Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length.  Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers: 

""Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items. Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once. Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards. Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level. Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items. For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods.""

It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character.  Not all characters are equal.  You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa.  Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill.

And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'.  Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice.

All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre.",playing path exile since 2011 closed beta remarkable far game come purely crowd funding passion userbase equally matched developer shown throughout year constantly improve tweak game regularly scheduled content addition still feel know everything know game changing time soon path exile incredibly complex rewarding game definitely worth time outside absurdly intricate skill tree fantastic crafting currency system large appeal game end game arpgs fail offer incentive continue play character exhausted content usually come form easily attainable level cap grinding final zone game length instead poe given item drop instance described developer map drop normal magic rare unique higher rarity map yielding item using map item open six portal area used like item path exile map mod change risk reward map mod affect size complexity level monster pack monster property even alter character level player modify map using currency item example use orb transmutation turn normal map magic map use orb alteration reroll mod go say every map different experience room countless variation modifier letting push limit character character equal find character excell early progression difficulty end game visa versa character made informed next critical game reward experience skill enough poe offer alternative arpg experience form daily race event time based leveling unique modifier see real game like turbo mode moreover race entirely unique content like descent champion endless ledge offer player ability win special art reskins legendary item league choice poe truly exciting game breath fresh air genre
1336490,Against the Storm,"There seems to exist a lot of misunderstanding around what Against the Storm is about, so I'll approach it from a fairly high-level angle.

Against the Storm is a superb adaptation-focused roguelite logistics simulator wrapped in a pleasant city-builder skin. It is notably faster-paced than a typical city builder, and revolves around optimally using a small, mostly-random subset of a very large toolkit to solve local optimization problems in a time-bound setting. The toolkit is so broad, it's difficult / impossible to hold it all in your head - well, my head anyway - which means a modicum of intuition and experience is needed to solve the problems the game revolves around, resulting in a delightful situation where every playthrough is different enough that common patterns are fairly scarce and have limited usefulness.

The game's aesthetic is notably peaceful, rather calm and largely non-violent, with excellent sound design and decent graphics direction. The time pressure imposed upon by the game rules is the main source of pressure, with few other sources, and combined with an extremely wide selection of difficulty levels, it might lend itself well to those of us who struggle with anxiety.

 If you value adaptation and exploration in games, enjoy frequent - perhaps scarily so - updates, and like a challenge that, as developers intend, is always solvable, while helping your subjects survive in a harsh environment, this might just be a game you could enjoy.",seems exist lot misunderstanding around storm approach fairly high level angle storm superb adaptation focused roguelite logistics simulator wrapped pleasant city builder skin notably faster paced typical city builder revolves around optimally using small mostly random subset large toolkit solve local optimization problem time bound setting toolkit broad difficult impossible hold head well head anyway mean modicum intuition experience needed solve problem game revolves around resulting delightful situation every playthrough different enough common pattern fairly scarce limited usefulness game aesthetic notably peaceful rather calm largely non violent excellent sound design decent graphic direction time pressure imposed upon game rule main source pressure source combined extremely wide selection difficulty level might lend well u struggle anxiety value adaptation exploration game enjoy frequent perhaps scarily update like challenge developer intend always solvable helping subject survive harsh environment might game could enjoy
216150,MapleStory,"If you haven't already been playing this game for years don't bother picking it up. It is absolutely not fit for new players who aren't willing to put in hours upon hours of out of game research and even more hours of grinding to get to even an early game level. You will spend many hours getting your first character to level 200-205 and then realize that this character is worthless without 7-8 more characters getting to level 120 for a few decent link skills and then even more to 140 so that you can start building up legion. Most of the bosses you unlock getting to level 200 are borderline not doable without first getting a boss carry to get the gear that they drop to even do enough damage to start contributing in boss fights that drop the gear that you need. They set the game up to almost require boss carries but are currently testing out nerfs to the boss carry system as an extra fuck you to its players. The game design is entirely based around grinding for low drop chance items from weekly bosses and mesos used to buy cubes to make that gear better along with an upgrade system designed to destroy your rare items to force you to grind again. Nexon is entirely out of touch with its community and makes stupid wide reaching changes on a whim even after explicitly stating that they wont (ie: totem removal). Nexon is consistently saying that players are progressing too fast compared to how long they think progress should take and start making changes to make the game even worse and grindier They are completely willing to neuter classes for no reason and remove many BiS items from the game making them completely unobtainable for anybody but veteran players who happened to pick it up before the removal. I genuinely believe that Nexon dislikes its community to a point where it is actively trying to drive players from its game by constantly making shitty changes that make the overall player experience worse.  I used to love this game I have so many fond memories of playing growing up and Nexon has done everything in its power to piss on those memories and make the game completely unrecognizable. Fuck you Nexon

Edit: Nexon just announced today that they are outright removing the Jett class from the game entirely. Jesus fucking Christ Nexon are you purposely killing any tiny shred of good will you had from your community by displacing thousands of characters and people who loved this class?

281990,Stellaris,"I can't believe I didn't give Stellaris a review to this date. I'll keep it short and sweet. 

Stellaris is, IMO, a well-executed blend of 4X and Grand Strategy genres. What really makes it shine is its exploration layer, the sheer volume of customization options and possibilities in its sandbox galaxy and emergent storytelling.

Plus it's a game made by people who love sci-fi. The number of references the story-driven events make to sci-fi movies or books is staggering. :)

I was massively on the fence with purchasing this game as FS19 has years of mods and content to back it up, but I took a gamble and can honestly say im glad I did!  Everything is improved in this game from FS19, and I mean EVERYTHING.  The graphics are better, the sounds are a massive improvement, vehicle handling is better, the UI from previous FS games has been thrown out the window and completely redone and is dramatically better, the seasons are completely optional and can be configured however you please, the return of collectables, much more in-depth character creator, the new AI system even in its first iteration is a dramatic overhaul and so much better than previous titles, the build and terrain system is completely different and much better than previous games with a more RTS feel to it like the new AI system, the new store layout is excellent with the ability to see and directly purchase all other items that are compatible with whatever you are buying and bulk buy pallets of seeds etc, the new production chains are awesome and give you so much more to do than the standard fieldwork and sell of previous games, but for me by far the biggest and best improvement of this game is the plethora of new graphical options, optimisation and the addition of DLSS support!  I am playing this game on maximum everything and my GPU is idling as I play the game instead of the jet engine it was playing FS19.

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"[h1]This is a fairly simple but effective and well thought out city builder with combat. [/h1]

Kingdoms and Castles allows you to create a city using colourful voxel pieces, make an efficient working supply chain, ensure your citizens are happy, command a small army and defeat rampaging vikings and creatures. There is a fairly small and limited set of buildings so I found it fairly easy to get my supply up and running efficiently, but then a plague wiped out half my citizens in one year. Damn, should have built that hospital sooner. You have to contend with winter, fires, disease and rampaging enemies.

Bands of Vikings will periodically raid and terrorize your city, whilst a dragon flies overhead and targets buildings to burn to a crisp. I even had an ogre destroy an entire section of wall, which I thought was quite rude. The Vikings will go around walls, so you can build your city to kite them through archer towers and ballista, ensuring that they're dead before they reach your population. Don't leave the centre undefended though - because of course, a dragon can simply fly over your fortifications!

You can build an army and you can control them (well, you can control a general and his recruits will follow), so there is an extra level of action to the game there.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
* Attractive voxel graphics
* Simple, but fun gameplay
* Static defenses such as archer towers and ballista
* Commandable units through an army
* Extra strategy required from both land and air units attacking.
* 3 difficulties, with easy having no attacks - so a relaxing city builder, or a more taxing RTS.
* Planned updates already listed so looks like it will only improve in the future.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
* Very small maps with odd shapes, a world editor or larger maps would be good.
* Most maps feel very similar (developer has said adding random ""unique"" things is on the table for an update though!)
* Eventually you will hit the limit for what you can do on a map. It certainly has replayability - but it's not endless.
* Very experienced city builders may find the game a little too simple.

For me, sometimes it's nice to play a city builder that is engaging but not too complicated. I'm really looking forward to the future updates!

[h1]It's very fun to play and set at a price point that makes me highly recommend it to fans of the genre.[/h1]

1384160,GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-,"I'm almost 50. The last time I played a fighting game was Samurai Shodown 2 at the bowling alley on old SUBASE Pearl Harbor (before the merger), and some Killer Instinct at the local movie theater I worked at after I left the Navy. In other words, I'm old, I'm slow, and I have no experience with modern fighting games.

So why now? What gets some crusty old sailor to buy a lightning-quick anime style fighter that has a reputation for being difficult for even good players to get into? 

Honestly, I just thought it looked cool. 

But I also heard it was a good entry point for new players. 

Now I've heard other games say they're good for new players as a ""starting point"", only to get into them and find out they actually expect you to have a ton of previous knowledge about the game to really get into. So I was worried that Guilty Gear would be the same, that it would be a baffling learning experience that never felt like it was teaching me how to really play the game.

But I gave it a chance. I played the tutorials and I was surprised to find out that I was, in fact, actually learning how to play this insane game. And even though I am old and slow and have the finger dexterity of a  two sticks of partially melted butter, I found myself getting better. 

Then I went online and actually won a few matches.

And that's when it really hooked me. This game took an ancient relic of an arthritic scarecrow nailed to a 2by4 and showed me that even I could learn and practice at getting better.

I've always loved fighting games but have always been intimidated by them. As beautiful as these games are with the flashy moves and gorgeous backgrounds and rocking soundtracks, I never felt like I could learn to play one well enough to actually beat another human being in an online match. But I did. 

And I want to do more and get better. 

This game rocks. I don't know anything about the previous GG games (I hear they're pretty insane) but this game has got me back into fighting games late in life and I can't wait to learn more and get better and maybe even one day watch EVO and actually know what the heck is going on. 

So, yeah. I HIGHLY recommend this game, even for salty old seafarers with stiff fingers and who are only a few years away from drawing a social security check.",almost 50 last time played fighting game samurai shodown 2 bowling alley old subase pearl harbor merger killer instinct local movie theater worked left navy word old slow experience modern fighting game get crusty old sailor buy lightning quick anime style fighter reputation difficult even good player get honestly thought looked cool also heard good entry point new player heard game say good new player starting point get find actually expect ton previous knowledge game really get worried guilty gear would would baffling learning experience never felt like teaching really play game gave chance played tutorial surprised find fact actually learning play insane game even though old slow finger dexterity two stick partially melted butter found getting better went online actually match really hooked game took ancient relic arthritic scarecrow nailed 2by4 showed even could learn practice getting better always loved fighting game always intimidated beautiful game flashy move gorgeous background rocking soundtrack never felt like could learn play one well enough actually beat another human online match want get better game rock know anything previous gg game hear pretty insane game got back fighting game late life wait learn get better maybe even one day watch evo actually know heck going yeah highly recommend game even salty old seafarer stiff finger year away drawing social security check

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"As a part of buying a new Nvidia GTX 1060 , I received a game for free named Monster Hunter World. A game, which I had no clue what it was all about, mainly due to my lack of knowledge of the previous Monster Hunter installments from Capcom. I didnt even try to play the game, until one month later.

It starts with a character who travels to ""New World"", a land mass filled with monsters. Along with the Research Commission that studies the land and its monsters, from a region named ""Astera"". The player begins the game by commencing a quest in ""Ancient Forest"". 

On hindsight it feels, along with the character, I had also commenced my ""journey"" - a journey to the amazing world of Monster Hunter. What an amazing journey it has been. How do I even begin to explain?

MHW + its expansion iceborne, consists of many distinct regions like - Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, Elder's Recess, Hoarfrost Reach and Guiding Lands. Each and every region, along with its tundra, the materials, the flora and fauna, the wildlife are distinctly different from one another. The joy I had in discovering the regions, even the smallest of them, were nothing short of amazing. The amount of time spent on collecting materials from these regions is insane, since there is always something you would have missed.  

The gameplay is very simple yet complicated - like most modern games, the player starts with the most basic of armor/weapons and eventually progress by defeating stronger monsters,thereby getting better weapons/gear. The real beauty of the game is that it allows so many different ways to achieve this, with the help of 14 types of weapons. Weapons, which i have never heard, seen or used before in any games. Each and every weapon is unique, has its pros and cons and not to mention their unique moves. I started the base game with dual blades, switched to bow till i reached a certain level and then changed to my favourite weapon charged blade. My current go to weapon being Long sword. I can keep on writing about the weapons, but it is something a player has to experience, persist and then slowly try to master it. Players will have a total different experience in taking on the same monsters with different weapons, the materials needs might be different and skills attached to it as well. 

MHW is not a hack and slash game - the player needs to understand the mechanics of weapons, how to build the gear around it, the preparation - in identifying the monsters weakness, the ""food"" the player needs to eat from canteen before a battle, how to use the environments in players favour, how/when to use traps. Last, defintely not the least and certainly the most important - studying/understanding monster movements , there by developing positional awareness in battles. This is crucial and is the main difference between a good hunt and tedious one where the player rage quits. The concept is simple, but learning curve is steep and the player needs to persist with it, in-order to have the best game experience. Monsters can still wreck you even after this :)

The monsters in monster hunter world - starting with the Great Jagras to the big daddy of 'em all Fatalis - all unique and distinct.  Their strengths, weakness, movements and attacks are so different - that it shows the amount of work Capcom has put into them. I have lost count on the amount of monsters and their ""variants"" available in this game. This is nothing short of exceptional. Monsters are so diverse and so much in much in number that I can write an entire section dedicated only about the monsters in the game.

I also had the pleasure of discovering something I have never discovered before (or shd i say avoided ) - multiplayer. This is the 1st game that i have played in muti player mode , since mostly i prefer only the single player side of things.  The in game experience quadriples when you go to an hunt with a full team of 4 - something i enjoy very much to this day and always brings a smile to my face. I have been extremely lucky in becoming friends with exceptional group of players and to this day we hunt as team. And that list just keeps on growing.

The game is not without its fair share of issues. This is not a game known for graphical fidelity like many open world games, but still needs immense GPU power to play it smoothly. The online server disconnects, glitches like playes landing on impossible areas and not to mention the insane grind, in-order to get jewels, weapons and armor. 

Despite this, the game is still extremely addictive. I have played close to 2650 hours - managed to learn and use (frequently) 7 diffrerent types of weapons and still play with my friends as much as possible. There are so many things I have missed to address. This is mainly due to the immense depth of MHW, the amount of layers the game has, that I find it next to impossible to explain each and every aspect of it. Not to mention the ""events"" which keeps on pulling players to the game as frequently as possible - hats of Capcom, you have created an absolute beast.

MHW - a game I never wanted to play and here I am, playing it almost every other day. The journey which commenced with me stepping into a world completely new, still continues and I am pretty much sure is gonna last for a long time. Quoting one of my friends - its that time of the day - time to bully the monsters.

306130,The Elder Scrolls® Online,"I've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not. I almost did, but it would be unfair to the game. The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized. It is so terribly monetized, that I almost gave this game a negative review. ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and conveniences, however both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESO. 

There are a number of rewards which are only obtainable through purchasing crowns with money, and with extremely expensive costs too. The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things. I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in game, but the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100. This gives players less things to actually play for, less things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselves.

In addition, you can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters), experience scrolls, mount training and the research scrolls for professions. The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug. They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hours, of which there are 180 skills to spend. That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training. This grind must be done on each character. The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon. When researching a trait, you must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another. My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions. Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly. ZOS, I want to play your game, but you're making it so hard.

The largest houses you can buy typically sell for around 14,000 crowns (€85) and are unobtainable otherwise. On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal. It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually are, especially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game. While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the game, these are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game. The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10,000 gold, up to 100,000 for the fanciest pieces. When you only get 300 gold for completing a quest, as a player, you must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing. ZOS, PLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests. This leads me to the auction house in game, and ESO plus. 

The best way to obtain money in this game, is by engaging in the auction house. I love the auction house system in the game, and the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s). One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus. If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bag, be prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes. It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicap, and so they move it to a pay-wall. There are other ways to make money in the game, such as farming for rare item drops for hours on end, hoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash out

ZOS are masters at creating problems and selling you the solution. The in-game store and the monetization is in direct conflict with the soul of this game, and I never feel satisfied playing this game. I want to engage in the housing, but the rate at which I can actually buy furniture, if I just do quests is extraordinarily slow. The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit better, as they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of gold, but I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at all.

ZOS, fix your monetization. I paid for this game, let me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls. If you want this game to be subscription based, make it subscription based, put everything from the store into the game, and remove the store. You can't have it both ways. I want to love this game, but with the way this game is monetized, I can't. 

If you enjoy questing and story-telling, you will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above. But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you don't have the space to pick them up. And then not having any money because you can't trade the materials you don't have.",thought lot whether give game bad review almost would unfair game largest painful issue game game shop way game monetized terribly monetized almost gave game negative review zos claim sell cosmetic convenience however thing clash core gameplay eso number reward obtainable purchasing crown money extremely expensive cost game objectively worse existence thing count one hand number mount collect game number mount buy obtain zos loot box closer 100 give player le thing actually play le thing collect fewer target set addition buy time saver grant ability point collected character experience scroll mount training research scroll profession issue take existence item indicative fact zos aware grind slug literally time gated learn one mount training skill every 24 hour 180 skill spend half year spending point max mount training grind must done character research scroll speed rate research trait weapon researching trait must wait increasing amount actual time unlocking researching another main character gotten point must wait 20 day learn new trait profession throw wallet zos get done instantly zos want play game making hard largest house buy typically sell around 14 000 crown 85 unobtainable otherwise hand housing system game phenomenal suffers lot though considering expensive furnishing actually especially compared little gold actually get playing game player obtain furniture piece playing game extremely far considering many furniture piece actually game nicer furniture piece often priced 10 000 gold 100 000 fanciest piece get 300 gold completing quest player must look get money system want engage fully housing furnishing zos please increase amount gold get quest lead auction house game eso plus best way obtain money game engaging auction house love auction house system game way force player part guild one thing help make gold use extra bank storage literally infinite crafting bag get subscribing eso plus plan sell crafting material crafting bag prepared full inventory every 10 minute like zos aware playing crafting bag handicap move pay wall way make money game farming rare item drop hour end hoping one eventually drop sell lottery cash zos master creating problem selling solution game store monetization direct conflict soul game never feel satisfied playing game want engage housing rate actually buy furniture quest extraordinarily slow crown get eso plus subscription make bit better allow buy furniture housing crown instead gold help feel like problem zos fix monetization paid game let play without locking feature behind time gate pay wall want game subscription based make subscription based put everything store game remove store way want love game way game monetized enjoy questing story telling probably enjoy game engage thing might get frustrated always full backpack walk past mining herb node space pick money trade material

Huh. 

I've waited. A good long while for this game to come out. Played the beta in 2020. Immediately fell in love with the style and a new game to the party brawlers. Waited patiently for 3 more years. Missed the first playtest. Played the next 2, and let me tell you. This game is a mixed bag. I like the game at its core, but everything else is muddied and I dont know how to feel about it. Let me explain. 
[h3] What I liked [/h3] 
[list]

[*] The gameplay. Its fun! It's a TON of fun. Its Gang Beasts meets Fall Guys. Its fun and easy to get into. Theres a lot of powerful items and moves, but the randomness in the physics and the large amount of players. Means theres still a pretty low skill ceiling and approachable to everyone.

[*] The style! Its so cute. Its a very pretty game and the fluffy animals beating the absolute piss out of each others is a fun spectacle.

[*] The maps! While I havent played much of the new maps. The maps that were in the beta. Were fun, unique, had a neat gimmick to them. Theyre well designed and fun to fight in.
[/list]
Unfortunately that's where my positives end and my gripes begin. 
[h3] What I don't Like. [/h3]
[list]
[*] No offline. Yep a game claiming that it has singleplayer and had offline local coop. It in fact. Doesnt. I would say I'm hurt by a company lying. If it werent so ****ing common nowadays. So no local coop unless you got a connection. What a joke. Gang Beasts had that sorted and that game is almost 10 years old now.

[*] Microtransactions. Now I get it. A company has to cover its costs somehow. It still feels grimy that a paid indie game has paid cosmetics and a full fledged shop. When problems exist in the game and they lie about offline coop. I know offline isnt in the game because they worry about you cheating past their store. Thankfully. Its not an entirely bad shop. Currency is earned in game for free by leveling up, and the free currency you earn can be used to unlock decent skins as well. As well as unlocking skins completing challenges. Still tho. With a game like this. Saying ""skins for animals"" just is weird to me. IMO tho. 

[*] Lootboxes.......****ing really? Pay 120 of your party animal fun bucks or whatever and get a randomized skin. Why? You already have a fortnite item shop. Did you really have to finish it off with that? We left that shit with Battlefront 2. 

[*] The gamemodes. Look. I want to beat the piss out of my fellow animal. Thats it. The other gamemodes are a complete waste on me because, like fall guys. I dont want to team up with strangers that wont do the objective. They want to beat the piss out of their fellow man too. Not play bootleg FIFA or Lucio Ball. They tend to either last 10 seconds as the team stomps the other. Or drags on all the way to the end timer and just isnt fun at all. 

[*] The quit penalty. This game isn't Valorant or CSGO. Why is there a leave penalty when people can join mid match if someone leaves? If someone (like me) doesnt want to play buzzball or soccer for the 2rd or 3th time in a row and want to play the elimination style modes instead.
[/list]
[h3] My suggestions [/h3]
[list] 
[*] Make the Team game modes separate. Fall guys did it so you can queue into those modes. So friends wanting to work with each other. Can. The gamemodes are fun, just not when playing all the time. Separate the game modes and adjust the XP gains to incentives team modes. Or if you dont want to do any of that. Just make it a best of 5. First team to 3 wins. Its that easy. Shortens the length. If you are getting stomped it ends sooner, and close match games can happen much more frequent. I would actually stick around to play them out. 

[*] Remove the quit penalty. Theres no reason for it. There is no rank system at all. We aint competing for the world cup. It'll be of no issue to get rid of it. 

[*] Work on offline ASAP. You told us it would be here on launch. It isn't. That doesn't sit well with anyone. 

[*] Make sure you maintain the currency gained so that people who do put in the time with this game dont feel cheated and the need to buy skins (tho thats exactly what you want isnt it?) I dont think the microtransactions are inherently scummy, but I still hate them in any game.
[/list]
[h3] Closing thoughts [/h3] 
Funnily enough. I enjoy the game. Its fun! Its Fall Guys meets Gang Beasts. The beat em up style gameplay is just fun and chaotic. I will be playing the shit out of this game and I would recommend off the gameplay alone, but with the current issues. I wont at the moment. If you got this far and still decide to get it. All I ask is that you dont support them in their shop. Not until the game is in a better spot and the issues everyone has are addressed.

Thanks for reading!

[h3] Update after one day [/h3]

All my points still stand. Including the leave penalty. The point I forgot to convey was that the game still punishes you. Well before the game starts. So if you see it about to get voted. You just cannot leave w/o punishing. Even tho the game hasnt started and theres still a full minute waiting period that your characters are in a locker room. That should be more than enough time to safely leave a game you dont want to play. That goes for any game mode not just the sports modes. I agree with keeping it after the game has started, but its not needed before.

After seeing this review got a lot of traction, and a lot of comments clearly missing the point that a review is completely subjective in their thoughts on it. My problems with it can and will be different than yours. I am fully understanding of the positive reviews and I do agree with them to an extent, but just because I enjoy the game doesn't mean I have to recommend the game.",google page member formerly ea smartisan tencent baidu game internet company huh waited good long game come played beta 2020 immediately fell love style new game party brawler waited patiently 3 year missed first playtest played next 2 let tell game mixed bag like game core everything else muddied dont know feel let explain h3 liked h3 list gameplay fun ton fun gang beast meet fall guy fun easy get there lot powerful item move randomness physic large amount player mean there still pretty low skill ceiling approachable everyone style cute pretty game fluffy animal beating absolute piss others fun spectacle map havent played much new map map beta fun unique neat gimmick theyre well designed fun fight list unfortunately positive end gripe begin h3 like h3 list offline yep game claiming singleplayer offline local coop fact doesnt would say hurt company lying werent ing common nowadays local coop unless got connection joke gang beast sorted game almost 10 year old microtransactions get company cover cost somehow still feel grimy paid indie game paid cosmetic full fledged shop problem exist game lie offline coop know offline isnt game worry cheating past store thankfully entirely bad shop currency earned game free leveling free currency earn used unlock decent skin well well unlocking skin completing challenge still tho game like saying skin animal weird imo tho lootboxes ing really pay 120 party animal fun buck whatever get randomized skin already fortnite item shop really finish left shit battlefront 2 gamemodes look want beat piss fellow animal thats gamemodes complete waste like fall guy dont want team stranger wont objective want beat piss fellow man play bootleg fifa lucio ball tend either last 10 second team stomp drag way end timer isnt fun quit penalty game valorant csgo leave penalty people join mid match someone leaf someone like doesnt want play buzzball soccer 2rd 3th time row want play elimination style mode instead list h3 suggestion h3 list make team game mode separate fall guy queue mode friend wanting work gamemodes fun playing time separate game mode adjust xp gain incentive team mode dont want make best 5 first team 3 win easy shortens length getting stomped end sooner close match game happen much frequent would actually stick around play remove quit penalty there reason rank system aint competing world cup issue get rid work offline asap told u would launch sit well anyone make sure maintain currency gained people put time game dont feel cheated need buy skin tho thats exactly want isnt dont think microtransactions inherently scummy still hate game list h3 closing thought h3 funnily enough enjoy game fun fall guy meet gang beast beat em style gameplay fun chaotic playing shit game would recommend gameplay alone current issue wont moment got far still decide get ask dont support shop game better spot issue everyone addressed thanks reading h3 update one day h3 point still stand including leave penalty point forgot convey game still punishes well game start see get voted leave w punishing even tho game hasnt started there still full minute waiting period character locker room enough time safely leave game dont want play go game mode sport mode agree keeping game started needed seeing review got lot traction lot comment clearly missing point review completely subjective thought problem different fully understanding positive review agree extent enjoy game mean recommend game

534380,Dying Light 2 Stay Human,"Sorry, this is kinda harsh.

- Weaker atmosphere and soundtrack. Aside from the combat this is the biggest sentiment I see mirrored online.
- Weapons can still be upgraded but no longer crafted
- The hang glider feels kinda clunky and slow despite being one of the very few additions I can name, and it's usage is enforced in many late game areas
- No x-ray damage in combat
- No PvP, which the first game had
- Enemies are generally less frightening to fight, with the nighttime being more of an inconvenience than the omnipresent terror that gave the series its literal tagline, given that volatiles don't come out unless you've been alerting the new and annoying-as-all-hell screaming enemies too much. Even the virals that would chase you at all hours of the day don't seem to be an issue unless you alert the screamers at night. These screamers are also almost entirely at street level, meaning that if you stick to the rooftops, which you usually do, then ""night"" basically doesn't exist-- effectively removing one of the most challenging, frightening, and iconic parts of the first game. In fact, the game has lots of missions and areas that encourage or require you to explore ground-level buildings at night, implying they're aware of this issue. Not only that, you have an upgradable immunity timer that outright KILLS YOU if you spend too long in the dark now. It literally feels like they're trying to cheat to get to the same experience.
- No real guns this time around
- Enemies have levels and health bars for some reason
- [EDIT: apparently they added a new gore system recently, so much of this is probably outdated, but that was added like a year after the fact so I am not going back to try it out] Blood and gore effects are far less visceral both in sound and presentation. Combat in general just isn't as punchy. I went out of my way to engage in combat in DL1 just to see the enemies' bodies getting damaged and to experience the cool ambient screaming and slow motion effects that would highlight intense kills, but now I just avoid it because the exciting bits are just absent. I would try to explain all the tiny details but just look up comparisons on YouTube-- there's a bunch.
- No vehicles, unlike in the original's DLC
- Choices ""impact the world"" as much as any other cookie cutter open world game, despite this being a major selling point during the original advertising run
- Very few new additions that really set the game apart, including an underwhelming skill tree that doesn't feel like it added anything the first game didn't have
- On that note, another one of the only things pushed as an improvement is the parkour, which feels very odd since the parkour was one of the strongest aspects of the first game. As such, the handful of new parkour moves and the improved responsiveness feel like only a marginal improvement since I don't recall anyone really complaining before outside of certain climbing sections. I would've liked to see them focus on the weaker elements like the poor story, forgettable side quests, and the removed systems instead of polishing something that could've realistically been left mostly as-is.
- Somewhat buggy in my experience
- Me and my friend were going to play this game together originally, but unlike the first game, co-op progress is not saved between players
- A story that seemed to show some promise initially that fell to the same lows (or lower) as the original by the end, with weak and underutilized characters being at the forefront. 
- The same two-map structure as the first game, added verticality in the second half of the game and all. Except this time it's skyscrapers instead of multi-story buildings meaning it's less about parkour and more about figuring out how to get around them with the hang glider and the ziplines, which is far more tedious and involves much less combat
- A new main character that is so embarrassingly similar to the original I mistakenly thought they had the same voice actor.

I literally had to take a step back and wonder if the first game was even as good as I remembered. That's how disappointing this game felt. Every change feels pointless, either because it removes something that made the first game so good or adds something that doesn't make up for it.

I can understand why people like the game, given that it isn't really *objectively* bad, but it is a 100%, unarguable downgrade from the first game. Aside from having less fun in general, it was very hard to tell what was wrong with the game while I was playing, but I began to realize what I liked so much about the original as I watched video comparisons. 

Ironically, this game is what I imagined the first game would be like upon first purchasing it-- the underwhelming, forgettable drop in the open world/zombie ocean it miraculously wasn't.

I think that is the underlying issue. People totally slept on Dying Light 1 *because* it looked relatively generic and uninteresting. It had a special charm that made it so enjoyable from its desolate sepia streets filled with particle and sound ambiance, droning synth soundtrack, black-spattered UI, horrifying volatile night encounters, realistic and shambling zombies, and the undeniably punchy and *squelchy* combat that was filled with many fun effects. Even the buggy in The Following DLC was a contentious issue because people thought it'd take away from the fun parkour, but it added a whole new system to play with and use to kill whole hordes of enemies-- whereas the hang glider in this game really does feel like it slows down the movement and combat. At no point during this game (aside from possibly the slightly stronger story buildup) did I feel this game was iterating on the original. I would be very hard pressed to list what has been added over the original game, but I found myself waiting for it to be *as* good as the original with its systems and presentations. And then the game ended. 

Dying Light 1 was *unexpectedly* good. Especially with its weak story, it teetered on being underwhelming, but it beat the odds. Trying that luck again was simply too ballsy and that lightning didn't strike twice.

I read Endie's positive review of the game and I really like the first line:

        ""I think TechLand actually shot themselves in the foot with Dying Light 2 by making 
     Dying Light first.""

because that's exactly my opinion of this game and why I can't recommend it. If a sequel isn't even going to be *as* good as the original, nor try anything significantly different, then what's the point? Why remove mechanics and core aspects of the presentation? Why make a heart-pounding zombie survival game easier and less frightening? Why do any of this while keeping the game's scope virtually unchanged? It ends up feeling like a weaker attempt at remaking the same game. If you haven't played a Dying Light game, play the first. If you have, then I can't think of a reason to play this.",sorry kinda harsh weaker atmosphere soundtrack aside combat biggest sentiment see mirrored online weapon still upgraded longer crafted hang glider feel kinda clunky slow despite one addition name usage enforced many late game area x ray damage combat pvp first game enemy generally le frightening fight nighttime inconvenience omnipresent terror gave series literal tagline given volatile come unless alerting new annoying hell screaming enemy much even virals would chase hour day seem issue unless alert screamer night screamer also almost entirely street level meaning stick rooftop usually night basically exist effectively removing one challenging frightening iconic part first game fact game lot mission area encourage require explore ground level building night implying aware issue upgradable immunity timer outright kill spend long dark literally feel like trying cheat get experience real gun time around enemy level health bar reason edit apparently added new gore system recently much probably outdated added like year fact going back try blood gore effect far le visceral sound presentation combat general punchy went way engage combat dl1 see enemy body getting damaged experience cool ambient screaming slow motion effect would highlight intense kill avoid exciting bit absent would try explain tiny detail look comparison youtube bunch vehicle unlike original dlc choice impact world much cookie cutter open world game despite major selling point original advertising run new addition really set game apart including underwhelming skill tree feel like added anything first game note another one thing pushed improvement parkour feel odd since parkour one strongest aspect first game handful new parkour move improved responsiveness feel like marginal improvement since recall anyone really complaining outside certain climbing section would liked see focus weaker element like poor story forgettable side quest removed system instead polishing something could realistically left mostly somewhat buggy experience friend going play game together originally unlike first game co op progress saved player story seemed show promise initially fell low lower original end weak underutilized character forefront two map structure first game added verticality second half game except time skyscraper instead multi story building meaning le parkour figuring get around hang glider ziplines far tedious involves much le combat new main character embarrassingly similar original mistakenly thought voice actor literally take step back wonder first game even good remembered disappointing game felt every change feel pointless either remove something made first game good add something make understand people like game given really objectively bad 100 unarguable downgrade first game aside le fun general hard tell wrong game playing began realize liked much original watched video comparison ironically game imagined first game would like upon first purchasing underwhelming forgettable drop open world zombie ocean miraculously think underlying issue people totally slept dying light 1 looked relatively generic uninteresting special charm made enjoyable desolate sepia street filled particle sound ambiance droning synth soundtrack black spattered ui horrifying volatile night encounter realistic shambling zombie undeniably punchy squelchy combat filled many fun effect even buggy following dlc contentious issue people thought take away fun parkour added whole new system play use kill whole horde enemy whereas hang glider game really feel like slows movement combat point game aside possibly slightly stronger story buildup feel game iterating original would hard pressed list added original game found waiting good original system presentation game ended dying light 1 unexpectedly good especially weak story teetered underwhelming beat odds trying luck simply ballsy lightning strike twice read endie positive review game really like first line think techland actually shot foot dying light 2 making dying light first exactly opinion game recommend sequel even going good original try anything significantly different point remove mechanic core aspect presentation make heart pounding zombie survival game easier le frightening keeping game scope virtually unchanged end feeling like weaker attempt remaking game played dying light game play first think reason play

569480,Kingdoms and Castles,"Do you love city builders? How about Medieval times? Yes? This city builder is something you are going to want to play. You will have to build your castle and keep, but you will need support because sooner or later you will have to face Vikings and dragons who are going to want to take your village out!

You will have to build some cozy little huts for your serfs as well as provide resources such as  food, stone, wood, charcoal, tools and weapons for them to use. All in the name of the King they will toil. Build them roads, bakeries and festivals as well, you have to keep them all happy! And you can keep track of all your serfs personally as well as collectively by viewing the serfs as well as their abodes. A lot of nice information it available to you when your observe the serfs homes. Do they have food? Charcoal? A job? Are they near resources they need? Are they too close to pollution? You need to be in the know because keeping the serfs happy is how you build a bigger and bigger village and city.

The graphics are very enjoyable for the game. I do however suggest getting rid of the clouds etc on the settings as sometimes it can be blinding. There are different skill levels to play on as well as a tough regular game where you can be attacked and then there is the basic building sim where you will not be bothered by the Vikings or Dragons. This city builder/resource gathering/strategy game is VERY recommended. It's not a real in depth strategy game it leans more towards a casual strategy type game, but it's still a fun game and should keep you occupied for a good 20+ hours. Also, getting all 12 achievements is not very hard, so it's perfect for those that like 100%. The current price of $10 is ok. You won't regret getting the game.",love city builder medieval time yes city builder something going want play build castle keep need support sooner later face viking dragon going want take village build cozy little hut serf well provide resource food stone wood charcoal tool weapon use name king toil build road bakery festival well keep happy keep track serf personally well collectively viewing serf well abode lot nice information available observe serf home food charcoal job near resource need close pollution need know keeping serf happy build bigger bigger village city graphic enjoyable game however suggest getting rid cloud etc setting sometimes blinding different skill level play well tough regular game attacked basic building sim bothered viking dragon city builder resource gathering strategy game recommended real depth strategy game lean towards casual strategy type game still fun game keep occupied good 20 hour also getting 12 achievement hard perfect like 100 current price 10 ok regret getting game

1336490,Against the Storm,"Against the Storm is a well-made game, but I want to say something that many other reviews haven't pointed out: this game is NOT a ""city-builder"" as fits the common definition of the genre. Yes, you do build little settlements, but the way you build them is much more in-line with strategy games rather than true city builders where your city layout and the aesthetics are major parts of the gameplay.

Against the Storm opted for a much more fast-paced and transitory experience, true to its claim of being ""roguelite,"" and this means that buildings go wherever they need to go or can fit, and aesthetics are an afterthought stuck also wherever they can fit to simply boost the resolve of your people or fulfill missions for the Queen. Each mission is run through as fast and effeciently as possible, and any settlement aesthetic or industry you manage to get up and running feels ultimately shallow as every scenario ends quickly.

The RNG in the game is also significant, and even though there are usually ways to win (especially on the easiest difficulty), you'll often find yourself put into a very difficult spot because of total RNG. Some modern gamers seem to like this while in my opinion it's not a good game mechanic and just makes things an annoying coin-toss with zero impact from the player's decision. That isn't ""gameplay,"" it's just pure randomness trying to create the illusion of game decisions. It isn't fun, it's tedious and completely out of the players' control. How you react to it is the important gameplay decision, but even this is usually quite limited to whatever resources you randomly discover on the map.

There are other game elements related to this heavily RNG/Roguelike design that become very annoying on the higher difficulties like mechanics that directly compete with each other. You need to expand your settlement and you constantly need wood, yet chopping wood and discovering glades makes the forest mad and upsets your citizens. It just feels annoying, and each round I won on higher difficulties was an exercise in non-stop tedium that felt like you squeezed out a victory due to constantly juggling the contradictory mechanics with the rest being complete luck. It felt like my decisions were very limited to a few factors that made little difference due to the nature of the RNG.

I didn't expect the game to be like that as it was advertised as a ""city builder"" which means you take the time to build up a functional city and are usually afforded some creativity in your layouts and customization. This game does have some of that, technically, but again your opportunities to use it are very limited by the arcade-like, rushed nature of the game design and game loop.

The atmosphere, UI, graphics, music, everything about the game is so competently done that it's very impressive. The developers have talent and clearly care about their game, and it does deserve praise, I just want potential buyers to be aware of what kind of game it is. I personally would love to have this level of polish and aesthetics in a slower-paced actual city-builder where I could fully explore the tech trees and industries, build different neighborhoods for the species, etc.. If I could give this game a sideways thumb, I would just because of that, but as it is now the game is quite good if you like that playstyle, and it's refreshing how polished it is in the epidemic of mountains of half-baked buggy early access games released every week. It plays like a finished game, and for that it does deserve a thumbs-up, just be aware of the experience you're getting.

1062090,Timberborn,"I've built all the things, I've researched all the things, and I've mined all the things.

What did I get out of it? Something that feels like a first impression. Or at least I hope that's what it is. The game is fascinating in the verticality that it necessitates. It doesn't offer you the ability to build up, it requires it. So city planning is so much more in depth than any other game of the genre if only because you'll quickly realize that you built yourself into a corner and can't make roads. All because you didn't plan ahead.\

The need to build dams is also pretty cool and interesting in this game. Functionally, it's just winter for any other game like this, where a season comes and you lose access to farms (and water). Except here, not only do you have a way to mitigate that, but it becomes vitally required. You may (and probably will) have entire districts or entire cities dedicated to storing water and plotting routes for rivers.

Another nice touch is the lower civilian count. Often times games will just dump loads of characters in to make it feel like a city. Instead here you just have what's realistically a small town even at large scale. Difference being that every citizen maters. A lot. Losing a handful of beavers can be crushing.

So why does this feel like a first impression? It doesn't feel like there's any purpose here, or any lasting complexity. Once I figured out a really easy stairway pattern for housing and routes for storage & workers, there was very little difficulty in planning. Once I built a district for water storage and two dozen water pumps, water was no longer a threat even in massive cities during week long droughts. There came a point that I just started spawning new city after new city to expand rapidly. If they died there, who cares, send new recruits from the hyper stable core city.

This is definitely a good game at time of writing, and I really hope they expand this to have a campaign with added complexity. Even as it stands, the team has already pushed the concept of a city builder beyond what currently exists, even if it's only a few extra feet. If they don't expand on the idea, it'll still be a good time, but it wont be a lasting one.

1336490,Against the Storm,"This is pretty much my dream game. Absolutely flawless game design. Every single mechanic is there for a reason and truly layers complexity on top of a simple game to the point of perfection. The roguelike aspects don't feel tacked on either, but rather serve as a carrot for the player to seek harder challenges in order to access said layers of complexity faster. I mean, the introduction of NPC factions competing against you a few hours in feels like a stroke of genius. It's super subtle and doesn't force you to engage with it, but it also has you going ""yeah but what if I push a bit harder..."" by your own merit. I adore games that allow the player to dynamically set their own difficulty like that. 

In terms of the game being label as ""early access"", I honestly can't even tell while playing. It already feels more like a finished game than any handful of high budget titles on the market. Certainly carried by the depth of the design decisions, but absolutely not lacking in sheer ""content variety"" either. If anything, I worry about the game's complexity spiraling out of control with further mechanical variations and/or concepts being added. As it stands, it's pretty much close to being perfectly balanced in that regard.

It's one of those ""one more turn"" games that is genuinely a struggle to walk away from once you start playing it. Straight up a GOTY and perhaps even a genre GOAT if it stands the test of time.

949230,Cities: Skylines II,"Hmm this is going to be a tough review.

Much like everyone else I was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it. 

When I first starting playing it I was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by I think for me at least for now I can't recommend this game in its current state.

Man I wanted to truly like this game and sometimes I still do but well...

A decent amount of the core features are improved, The graphics, style, road placement and management and UI but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing, barely improved or outright worse or missing. 

For starters the game is buggy, certain systems don't quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff. Then there is performance. 

Some people may excuse it but I for one certainly can't. Having personally worked in the Unity ecosystem for 5+ years I can personally say they dropped the ball here. The graphics are great, Truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a LOT to fix an I feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes. 

As a fan and customer I personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at low-medium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then CS1 its not that much better tbh. 

This is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a LOT of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things. 
That is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall, 

The service vehicles don't have animations, there is less variety to all of the npcs and AI compared to the first game, Everything is sadly very static in regards to the ""world"". Most of the AI is just going from A to B and you can't even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel.

I think pets work now, Pretty sure I've seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs, which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug. 

I have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people, One of them fucking died and whenever I want a laugh I just check up on them. It is another funny bug.

Pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well.

A lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue I don't remember being present in CS1.

I found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasn't improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then CS1 and overly lacking. 

From a distance everyone's creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks. Somehow less variety then CS1 at release side by side which makes no sense.

Like fences really? I can't even place fences? or quay walls which were in the first game, I can't modify existing details within buildings? or rocks and benches, I can follow an NPCs ""life path"" but god forbid I wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them. 

There is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating, Like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99% of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason, Don't like it? Just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd. 

Also no idea why a plopable Rico isn't here in the base game. The assets are there, LET ME CHOOSE THEM PLEASE.  

As time has gone on I have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all. 

For a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they can't really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game..

Lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic AI.

At low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window, Its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone! 

I spent more time stumped at how brain dead the AI overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it. 

I had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used. When I zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes, Some would do U-turns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as IRL I'm learning to drive right now and the AI is making decisions I don't think I would ever make in a car even if I was 10 years old. Its insane! 

Not to mention services, I have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasn't fixed the AI, A dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery... WHAT? They are lucky that meteors can't be thrown willy nilly like in CS1.  

I think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasn't an option early access at discount, Would of been better for the brand, devs and community.

That isn't the worst of it though. For me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions. They knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway. From the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism. 

I think in time they can turn it around, They did pretty good with CS1 and I think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits. Here I think the concept is good its just the execution. The bones are here for a great game. A lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and I do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed. What I have experienced so far overall I can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly. 

The more I play this game the more depressed I feel about what could have been yknow?. 

I love some parts of it but some other parts I just loathe and get annoyed. I'm currently trying to make a very realistic city and I'm running into so many design limitations with the current tool-set compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks. 

I overall feel very mixed. At times it can be really great and chill, Other times it can be the opposite.

Hopefully they can improve the overall performance, Fix all the major bugs & at times broken simulation, Add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in CS1 at launch and MAYBE just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for DLCS, Free patches & overhauls for many years to come.

If you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year. Its a fine game overall even with the issues just don't go in expecting greatness, Some parts or better, Most are the same and some are worse then the first game.

It isn't worth the full price, Not even close, 40 AUD max, 60 AUD with the extra content.

See, it's the little things that make ETS/ATS worth the time. The very simple task of taking things from places to places as you listen to the world (or the radio station) and think about yourself, or what'll make for dinner, or what was that thing I was supposed to do tomorrow. It's pure therapy.

If what I wrote sounds something only 'slow gamers' would enjoy, I just want to say that I'm 24, and I play competitive games all the time, along of any other genre of games. But 5-7 years from now, I know I won't be playing Rainbow Six Siege, just like I stopped playing CSGO.

1361210,"Warhammer 40,000: Darktide","This game is great. Everyone who is into space fantasy loves 40k. Most 40k games are sub par knock offs of other popular games, some form of turn based  or  real time strategy game. We all remember playing Dawn of War or watching our siblings play and just thinking how cool the whole 40K universe is. Darktide is the first person godsend we all want in a slew of bad 40k videogames. Fatshark did an incredible job with VT2 and everyone had massive hopes for this game when it was first announced.  I played the closed beta and the ""prelaunch beta"" and racked up many hours in the game. It IS a great game. More vermintide fun which is exactly what I want, but in the way cooler setting of 40k. The atmosphere, music, combat. You will read about people singing its praises for these categories, and it is deserved. The issue though, is that FatShark clearly has a gem of a game they are covering in absolute filth. We had so much more at launch with vermintide 2 and it is STAGGERING how much they have tried to push the envelope with the term ""minimum viable product"". They obviously had multiple new systems in place and scrapped em throughout the 4 different delays this game saw, resulting in them copy pasting the talents system from vermintide2 in the most uninspired way possible.  We were told only 4 classes because the were going to be SO MUCH different than the career system in vermintide2. What we got instead is just the exact same thing as careers, and 8 less of them. OH but guess what, they plan to roll out new classes quarterly and ""are still debating if they will be free or paid"". ILL GIVE YOU TWO GUESSES, BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED ONE FOR WHAT THEY WILL DO. Every progression system is RNG grind, not fun and deterministic grinding. You want a force sword for your psyker since its a psyker exclusive weapon? Good luck, i played mine to 28 and went from levels 3 to 26 without seeing a single force sword in the hourly RNG shop. Whatever, I will just go craft a sword and upgrade it myself. NOPE, didn't carry that system from VT2. Wanna experiment with gear? Sorry, maybe you will get a random emperor's gift after 15~ games that is the weapon you want to try out and play with. 70+ guns in the game at launch? LOL 40 of those are literally different laz or auto guns with differences as major and game changing as ""full auto vs semi auto"". Special weapon attacks on every weapon? HA its a dam on/off button for a flashlight or a terrible weak melee attack on all of them. 

There is a gem here, the gameplay is good, and fatshark deserves praise for making the best first person combat system I have every played and refining it even further in darktide. However, they also deserve scorn for all the missing systems, and releasing a BARELY viable game missing nearly all core features that FatShark said we would have on launch. DONT FORGET THOUGH, the cash shop is in game now and fully functional. With the lovely ""buy 2100 coins but the skin costs 2400 coins and wouldnt you know it, we don't sell coins in bundles besides 2100 and 4000. only available for 24 more hours!"" Absolute scumbag practice THEY BOUGHT INTO. In VT2 you could buy skins for ACTUAL CASH THROUGH STEAM. This is anti consumer and anti gamer. If the game was F2P, these are pretty excusable systems to let the devs make money, BUT YOU PAID FOR THE GAME.

Buy this game on sale, and get it at least a year and a half  after launch because that is when this will be out of early access and have full features. The game going gold today is an absolute lie and scam from FatShark and their investors.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,i get called slurs ive never heard of before,get called slur ive never heard
552990,World of Warships,"Can’t recommend the game under any circumstance.

1. WG is heavily monetizing everything. 
	Monthly sub
	Battle Pass
	Containers (for economic bonuses)
	Premium ships
	Early Access Events
	Dockyard
	Lighthouse
Their main standing is that you don’t “need” any of this, and indeed, you can play the game without paying anything. However, I will say that it becomes excruciating to grind a line. You may even end up in a situation where you are losing more resources than gaining just by playing the game in higher tears.
90% of the game is RNG - from shooting/dispersion, penetration, fire chance, detonation, flooding, matchmaking, and container drops.
In other words - Gambling! (textbook)

Also, you have no channel for feedback except the forums - which is a waste of time. The people that read those are just community managers, which means they acknowledge your option and ignore it.

The reporting system is just there to say “it’s there”. Reports have 0 impacts.
Blacklisting does nothing

Overall it’s obvious that the company identifies what people enjoy doing in the game and then they take it away.



2. Gameplay and Meta: 
Current meta is “Stay at range and farm damage”.
The worst class to play is a BB (Battleship). You are just a pinata for people to farm off you.
Nobody pushes, lately, people don’t even want to go for objectives. (Can’t really blame them)

The main issue with the game meta is CVs and Subs. 
Bad matchmaking forces you to endure 2 CVs in a game - and that is made worse by adding the new Hybrid BBs so - 3 CVs in one game (per-side!). Tones of fun.
Absolutely no counterplay against CVs. T10 Premium CVs are … I don’t even know what to say.
You pay - you win. You need to be mentally challenged to do bad in those.

Subs - Two words  “homing torpedoes”! Because aiming is for losers!
Although, I have to say, that mistakes playing subs do get punished very severely. So to an extent, a counterplay is possible.

Then we come to Super-Ships - no comment here - Just T11 Damage-Piñatas and even stronger CVs (Jet-Plains bby!) - Fun times for T9 players ;)

Regarding the game mode: Random Battle is garbage - but it’s the only way to level.
Ranked is a joke but better than randoms, however, they are level (Tear) locked, so overall not good if you are looking to level.
Other game modes are scarce.
Also, most modes are time locked - which means that if you are an EU person that plays on US servers - you are …out of luck :D


3. Community: 
The stated above only makes the following a logical conclusion. Bad game mechanics on top of the greedy company on top of bad development breeds a toxic community.
After League of Legends, WG’s products (WoTs and WoWs) are probably the games with the most toxic communities. Here, I am not talking about the random burst of frustration that people make when they have a bad streak of games (5 games with double CVs for example) or people with less than 2k games that are struggling to understand and learn the core mechanics of the game - No. The main issue comes with people with 10k or more matches on their belts. With accounts that were made during the beta stages of the game. Those people go the extra mile to constantly stat-shame you and bully you after the match.
I have had very few cases of people actually offering a bit of constructive advice other than just snarly sarcasm when you ask a how-to question in the chat.

I am by no means a “good” player. I am barely hitting average scores, however, I have enough matches on my belt to see the general trend. And let’s face it - you don’t need a degree in rocket-science to see what’s happening.

I can’t recommend this game to anybody. In fact, I strongly recommend deleting it and doing something other with your time. Games are supposed to be fun and even a loss should provide you with the opportunity to learn in order to do better. This game rarely does that.
Even from a money perspective. Even if you have the money to get everything you want, the quality you get for that amount of cash is extremely poor. 
Honestly, if you like warships so much, go buy a scale model and paints, watch a few videos and enjoy the time. You will learn more and have more fun than playing this game. This will make this a lot better financial (and health) choice … and you will have something to show for it ;)

To all of you that are playing this game, just delete it. I know I will.

252490,Rust,"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

1599340,Lost Ark,"[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You'll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there's more!   If you don't, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That's right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you'll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you've never before dreamt of!   Don't wait, apply today!

Snarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you'll find it's never enough, unless you've spent thousands.   I'm serious, it's beyond insanity. 

I have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it's just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren't over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It's a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  

The only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you'll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you'll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.

You'll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   

What the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you'll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.

How do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   

Of course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn't buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren't a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   

You see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it's not the gold that is worth anything - it's their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.

Which is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I'm not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it's just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. 

There are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous ""I'd rather watch paint dry"" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you'll try to participate in, and so much more.

105600,Terraria,"I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.

Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. 

Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. 

After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. 

With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.

I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. 

Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. 

Sincerely,

552990,World of Warships,"This game is addicting and you live for the highs of the gameplay. But it's also addicting in the sense of a predatory free-to-play game. The expenses of all the paid parts of the game are INSANE, ships going up to £100, premium time, resources, re-allocating points and equipment. You get so wrapped up that you start rationalising spending stupid amounts of money on a single digital ship. Everything in this game is pressuring you to spend money.

DO NOT play this game if you have issues with addiction or impulse control. If you do play this game look into guides on how to play effectively without paying or paying as little as possible.

And none of this is to mention the gameplay experience. When in a vacuum its so enjoyable, but the balance and resultant metas are frustrating and long lasting. That you have to choose between fighting mindless W pressing bots, or island hiding HE spamming snipers.

2198510,New Cycle,"Right off the bat, New Cycle has some serious charm, nailing the fundamentals of city building. It is one of those games where you start planning a few buildings, and before you know it, hours have flown by. 

The pacing, while a bit slow at the start, actually adds depth to the gameplay, allowing you to really soak in the environment and strategize your city's growth. This gradual build-up is great for players who appreciate a game that unfolds thoughtfully.

Visually, the game has a consistent and clean aesthetic. Each building maintains a uniform look that brings a cohesive feel to your city. The soundtrack is exceptional. It complements the gameplay beautifully, enhancing the overall experience.

On the technical side, New Cycle is impressively stable. No bugs or glitches to report, which is a testament to the developers' attention to detail. This smooth performance really lets you immerse yourself in the game without any distractions.

It's a game that city builder enthusiasts should definitely keep an eye on, and I strongly recommend diving in and experiencing it for yourself. Don’t just watch its development – be a part of it!

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"This is my review fresh off playing patch-hell post Shadowbringers, the third big expansion available for Final Fantasy XIV.

[u] My review is not aimed at the typical person who is interested in this game already[/u]. 

[b]If you are being harassed by some friend, spouse or group to join in, this review is for you.[/b] 
I should also mention this is the first game of it’s kind I’ve played.

Most people call this title a MMO, but secretly, Final Fantasy XIV is a gigantic single player JRPG with massively multiplayer elements, which has a slope of endurance required to show its true colors, potential, and best qualities.
As a custom made Warrior of Light, you will embark in continent-spanning adventures, meeting a big cast of friends and foes, as you search for your place in this world, ripe with war, history and sights.

By far the biggest issue is that you WILL feel overwhelmed and confused for a while, more if this is your first entry in the franchise. Several references and callbacks will be lost on you, but that's second to the big issue. 

Getting used to everything there is to do in its side activities alone can be a gauntlet, so if your friends care about you, demand they give you a hand. Some mechanics and gameplay elements are easy to pick up and learn, some are either so overwhelming or convoluted I have not bothered after a curious look. While the community and game extensively have documented everything, getting handholded by someone else is, in my opinion, ideal for the first few hours. 

The third problem is this game genuinely takes time to actually be worth playing. There is no nice way of putting it, while there has been some retroactive changes, the first chapter, Realm Reborn, is a very poor first impression which only the promise of better things making it tolerable. Several quests aren’t fun, most of the characters are not interesting and the few who eventually become your most trusted companions dont start true development until later.

[u] If you’re not already reconsidering, keep reading[/u] .

Most of the game main story quests focus on exploring giant regions, doing favors to different factions and groups to further your goals, and meeting all sorts of walks of life. Some regions have rather poor design, making it easy to be lost or be painful to navigate on foot or mount, as well as less than pleasant visuals or annoying paths. Generally however most are well realized, and starting with the second expansion the new areas are mostly good.

The quests are an assortment of your usual kill thing or collect stuff, but some notably take a bigger focus on the ongoing narrative, like helping soldiers after a battle or simply checking on the mental state of an ally. While some quests do have the sin of making you go back and forth between long distances, very few are confusing or not clear on what to do, so most of the time you’re focused on the going-on instead. Notably some quests have dungeons, raids and trials attached, which have the best and worst content in the game.

Some are difficult but fair for blind play, requiring everyone in the party to work together, some have complete slap in the face design that you’ll be asking what were they thinking. This is again a good spot to demand a friend to be with you.

This leads me to the presentation and overall story, that as I said, starts rather barren and slowly builds up. 

It’s Stormblood where the game starts to truly improve, even with caveats. The new villains are overall a wasted potential, with some great moments undermined or underutilized. The few who will remain relevant long term do get a better development but this comes post-patch. However, many of the dungeons begin experimenting, the cast begins to shine and become people worth caring about, and the music is genuinely fantastic.

Here at last, in Shadowbringers, the overwhelming praise is vindicated- the cast is extremely well developed and written, the antagonists and neutrals are deep, complex and nuanced, all the bosses and battles are epic in scale and a good challenge, the score is outstanding and hours of quests, dungeons, trials, and a slew of issues get paid off in an excellent climax that is a rollercoaster of emotions.

However, the ending does bring the question post-clarity if the amount of effort to get here is worth it, which is why again I implore that if you are being dragged to this game, have those dragging you beside you.

FFXIV can be great a adventure with a gigantic amount of content in the main story, let alone side content, that ranges from insane minigames in a casino, to hilariously self aware questlines, in a captivatingly massive, yet intimate journey.
It can also be a slow, frustrating, confusing, tedious game with constant “what were they thinking” moments, some gameplay related, some story related, with a community that ranges from welcoming, fun and friendly to obnoxiously insufferable and a waste of oxygen to the planet.

In short, if you can get an equal amount of investment from whoever is making you play to stick with you, this game is worth the try and it can be a great experience in retrospect, but in the moment you’ll occasionally want to choke the life out of him.",review fresh playing patch hell post shadowbringers third big expansion available final fantasy xiv u review aimed typical person interested game already u b harassed friend spouse group join review b also mention first game kind played people call title mmo secretly final fantasy xiv gigantic single player jrpg massively multiplayer element slope endurance required show true color potential best quality custom made warrior light embark continent spanning adventure meeting big cast friend foe search place world ripe war history sight far biggest issue feel overwhelmed confused first entry franchise several reference callback lost second big issue getting used everything side activity alone gauntlet friend care demand give hand mechanic gameplay element easy pick learn either overwhelming convoluted bothered curious look community game extensively documented everything getting handholded someone else opinion ideal first hour third problem game genuinely take time actually worth playing nice way putting retroactive change first chapter realm reborn poor first impression promise better thing making tolerable several quest fun character interesting eventually become trusted companion dont start true development later u already reconsidering keep reading u game main story quest focus exploring giant region favor different faction group goal meeting sort walk life region rather poor design making easy lost painful navigate foot mount well le pleasant visuals annoying path generally however well realized starting second expansion new area mostly good quest assortment usual kill thing collect stuff notably take bigger focus ongoing narrative like helping soldier battle simply checking mental state ally quest sin making go back forth long distance confusing clear time focused going instead notably quest dungeon raid trial attached best worst content game difficult fair blind play requiring everyone party work together complete slap face design asking thinking good spot demand friend lead presentation overall story said start rather barren slowly build stormblood game start truly improve even caveat new villain overall wasted potential great moment undermined underutilized remain relevant long term get better development come post patch however many dungeon begin experimenting cast begin shine become people worth caring music genuinely fantastic last shadowbringers overwhelming praise vindicated cast extremely well developed written antagonist neutral deep complex nuanced boss battle epic scale good challenge score outstanding hour quest dungeon trial slew issue get paid excellent climax rollercoaster emotion however ending bring question post clarity amount effort get worth implore dragged game dragging beside ffxiv great adventure gigantic amount content main story let alone side content range insane minigames casino hilariously self aware questlines captivatingly massive yet intimate journey also slow frustrating confusing tedious game constant thinking moment gameplay related story related community range welcoming fun friendly obnoxiously insufferable waste oxygen planet short get equal amount investment whoever making play stick game worth try great experience retrospect moment occasionally want choke life

[h1]...what makes this game so special?[/h1]
 
[i]Apart from being high quality entertainment, it's also meant to let the player experience certain symptoms of a psychosis, like hearing inner voices or weird changes of perception. It was done in cooperation with experts on the topic, aswell as several people suffering from that particular mental disorder sharing their experiences. There's a short, but well arranged making-of video (about 25 minutes) linked in the main menu, including interviews of those people and the devs, which will help you to interpret the events of the story correctly and will probably change your perspective on the game - highly recommended to be watched [b]after[/b] the first playthrough.[/i]

270880,American Truck Simulator,"I first saw ATS a long time ago when I watched my son playing it but wasn't keen to be a driver here while I was driving for real. Would've been too much, although I was really interested and helped him with turning and reversing and stuff.
I love driving, always have, it's a passion. About a year after I retired I got the urge to keep the passion alive so I started a Steam account and my son gifted ATS to me as an early Christmas present and I've been driving here since Oct 2016.
Got into it big time and became addicted real quick. There's nothing I'd rather do than get in the truck, take a load somewhere and experience the sunrise, sunset and the great scenery. I've done a lot of real life night driving into daylight and when it happens in the game it's so real I yawn and feel that special tiredness you only feel when daylight breaks and you're still behind the wheel, even though it might only be two in the arv at my place. I'm always thinkin about when I'm goin to be drivin next and what I'm gunna do.
It's late at night and I hear, ""Are you comin to bed yet?"" I say, ""I'll just drop this load off and I'll be there."" Then a couple of hours later I hear, ""When are you comin to bed?"" and I say the same thing again and hear, ""You said that two hours ago."" That's how it is and that's what it does. The best form of addiction I could ever recommend. My personal opinion? ATS - It's a lot better than going to bed!",first saw at long time ago watched son playing keen driver driving real would much although really interested helped turning reversing stuff love driving always passion year retired got urge keep passion alive started steam account son gifted at early christmas present driving since oct 2016 got big time became addicted real quick nothing rather get truck take load somewhere experience sunrise sunset great scenery done lot real life night driving daylight happens game real yawn feel special tiredness feel daylight break still behind wheel even though might two arv place always thinkin goin drivin next gunna late night hear comin bed yet say drop load couple hour later hear comin bed say thing hear said two hour ago best form addiction could ever recommend personal opinion at lot better going bed

230410,Warframe,"I've been playing Warframe for a very long time since 2013, been hating it, fanboying over it then hating again. Despite all the negative aspects of this game I still recommend trying it out. 

 I'll leave it recommended to play, but let me tell you... 

- Don't bother understanding this game if you've never played looter in your life, the amount of grind this game requires is humongous especially in ""open world"" areas. 
- The game is not newbie friendly and it won't hold your hand explaining every aspects, you'll have to manually find answers in codex and wiki, and there's way too much to learn as most of Warframe aspects are quite unique and can't be learned through playing other games alike. 
- Warframe as looters tend to be, is a very repetitive game, you'll often find yourself doing same thing over and over again be it farming resources, warframes, mods etc.
- Over last 2-3 years developers seems to be running out of ideas and creativity, with copypasta open world content, to very buggy and plain boring new mechanics and bosses releases. Development of the game nearly stopped and the focus of the game is now to monetize skins, before we hit 1 decent update around 70 new skins are released.
- Game doesn't have any dungeons, raids , good crafting systems (altho it has crafting in OW areas I wouldn't call it anything good or even close to be crafting) 


The prime time in WF development was around 2015-2016 when they kept pushing the story and new content with it. I would highly recommend you to play thru the Quest system in Warframe, it's locked inside of progression system but quick google/youtube search could guide you how to start playing thru Quests within 10-15 hours of gameplay. 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- So graphics, this game doesn't have ""real cool shit"" to blow your mind, the graphics are not the prime of this game, however, what compliments it is - unique play models (warframes) and solid optimization, this game can run on potato, beleive me, I've tried. 

Overall 7/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Monetization is alright, I would say revolutionary, compared to EA, Activision etc.
I'ts pretty fair, you can even get yourself 50/75% off deals from time to time when you log-in 
Game is not greedy and doesn't force you to spend money to progress or lock you behind paywalls. It's truly a free-to-play experience if you want it to be. 
Altho you can instantly buy Warframes, Weapons and skins/costumizations the core game is 100% playable and you can get all of it's content for free, except skins, but... 
Warframe has trading and you can trade the stuff you farmed for premium currency. 

So the monetization balance is fair for everyone, if you can spend alot of time playing it you'll get rich, or if you can't spend time playing the game but still want to progress faster you can dump few bucks and speed it up. 

Overall 9/10 

-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  

- Gameplay is quite interesting which blures it's repetitiveness, you have bunch of unique Warframes, weapons, powers and this game is really trying to make you as powerful as possible, like clearing your screen with one button tap - that's Warframe. 

In time this degrades and new Warframes look just like another one but either weaker or overpowered. Game doesn't really improve in mission types, we still have the same stuff as we had before with minor additions and I just can't find a random lobby for archwing/railjack missions as no one plays them. 

Overall 7/10

- Game lore, this game has pretty massive one I'll give it that, for a looter-shooter game it has pretty nice and unique story which you'll find in Quest cinematics and codex.
I've really enjoyed playing thru all of them and even if you don't like grind you can set it aside and play this game solely for it's quests. 

The devs however got pretty lazy with updating their story as it doesn't monetize their game enough so updates on it take years, while other games with less staff giving bigger and passionate updates. 

For what we have 8/10

2186680,"Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader","""It's an Owlcat game"" is not an acceptable excuse. This is their third release. They should know better by now. BE better.

There are a lot of good things I would love to say about this game, despite its flaws I love it to death, but it is virtually unplayable in the later Acts. Bug after bug piles up until the whole game comes apart at the seems. Empty text boxes, uncompletable quests, incorrect flags on dialogue options leading to nonsensical outcomes, stuck cut scenes. You will be reloading a save every 5-10 minutes to try to force the game to work properly. A bugged talent here and there, or a side quest, yeah, I get it, but the ability to actually complete the game should be the bare minimum standard. 

It is unconscionable to recommend this game in the state that it is in. Maybe in a few months I will change this review and be able to give the game the praise that it could have deserved. But I can't do that right now.",owlcat game acceptable excuse third release know better better lot good thing would love say game despite flaw love death virtually unplayable later act bug bug pile whole game come apart seems empty text box uncompletable quest incorrect flag dialogue option leading nonsensical outcome stuck cut scene reloading save every 5 10 minute try force game work properly bugged talent side quest yeah get ability actually complete game bare minimum standard unconscionable recommend game state maybe month change review able give game praise could deserved right
1326470,Sons Of The Forest,"Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.

          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.

	Endnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. 

	As far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The ""quick inventory"" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.

	But holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.

	I see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.

	I think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game.",since one positive review willing explain guess right bat visually game jaw droppingly phenomenal lighting presentation atmosphere brilliantly captured ensure older fan first game feel like returning somewhere feel oddly familiar yet hold many new unique encounter yet discover color especially green pop right way emphasize seemingly calm collected forest day quickly change dark unsettling nightmare night endnight hit nail head combat considering old system charging momentum land attack worked exceptionally well understandable try reinvent wheel combat expanded smoothed enough keep feeling fun fresh different landing hit satisfying old game mastering technique especially entertaining new enemy original upgraded counterpart far interaction mechanic inventory system cleverly improved kelvin genuinely cool addition game friendless loser kelvin around good company interacting intuitive straightforward losing track problem gps get right bat starting way orient map five time bigger first game also welcome change quick inventory move welcome upgrade well crafting menu also improved separating custom building presets make easier keep track make using custom building unfortunately garbage control scheme return first five minute new save making game playable instead playing game holy smoke building 1000 better first game still already mentioned presets use pinch massively improved custom building instead laying want everything go get pick choose create desired structure make way easier manage resource making also allows make change see fit huge step previous game great see complaint performance personally issue medium preset game ran rock solid 75 80 fps perfectly fine game like survival game need absurdly high frame rate important certainly frame time consistency game would rarely drop frame stayed 76 77 fps little deviation think really game nutshell first game pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded reworked positive way part reused sound fx throughout game thought little disappointing expectation team 30 people people get wrapped fact visually competes triple game people forget tiny team 30 put together asking 30 buck steal game much visual fidelity replayability mention oncoming free update add content certainly okay critical product point flaw expectation check come pretty solid game

594650,Hunt: Showdown,"I have played the game for nearly 800 hours, and man I am bad at it. But that doesn't keep me from playing, because it's awesome. I have read a lot of complaints about campers, so let me assure you, I am one of those campers. Hunt: Showdown allows for many a play style, like rushing in with a shotgun, duelling with pistols, or sniping from far away. There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyle, so don't complain about it. I have played computer games for nearly 40 years now, I'm 55, and I cannot (and would not want to) compete with the Fortnight Kiddies (like my sons...).
So I will continue playing, I will continue sniping, and I will desperately try to push my KD past 0.60 - a task of herculean dimensions.

Update: I have to correct myself - I'm not a camper, I'm a sniper. I run around, I follow the bounty carriers, I try to get into a favorable position, and then try to shoot them from a safe distance... but all the time I get shot by the campers. Damn those campers!
So now I'll change my tactics: I try to become a close combat killer. I'm fairly certain that this step will halve my already measly KD, but whatever, as long as it's fun...

New Cycle is a clone of Surviving the aftermath. It's just that they change the catastrophe from nuclear waste to solar flare. Same buildings category with same function. Same type of events popped up during the days.

And with early access, the content is far less than Surviving the aftermath. Not to mention that the research tree is even more linear and limited.

Maybe in the future, New Cycle may surpass other games in the genre, but currently not for sure.",another colony sim apocalyptic survival theme nothing new mechanic gameplay experience new cycle clone surviving aftermath change catastrophe nuclear waste solar flare building category function type event popped day early access content far le surviving aftermath mention research tree even linear limited maybe future new cycle may surpass game genre currently sure
